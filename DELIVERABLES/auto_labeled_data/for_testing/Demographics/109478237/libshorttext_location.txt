17	Could be good wicket for Eng ,  20 mins at em before lunch
17	Yankees picking all their best defensive players behind Andy Pettite tonight .  Unders a possibility
17	Lights coming back on enough to show coming rainstorm  # ALCS  # longnight
17	Wonder what score Sussex need to be jollies at the break ?  About 850 judging by this market
17	Brian Hoyer hands of to Willis McGahee .  .  .  . its going to be a long old season .  .  .  .  .  .  .

17	Why does Goodwood get the universal addendum Glorious ?  Why not Ravishing Redcar or Fantastic Ffos Las too ? 
17	If Saban goes to Texas ,  biggest coaching coup down there since Buddy Garrity got coach Taylor back from TMU

17	Same plan as 1st inns for me ,  keep batting side for 1st 6 then hope for the slowdown

17	Interesting .  Looking at the news ,  seems like for the first time this year Washington has actually played some defense .  .  .  . 
17	 # Benteke treated Genk like shit to move to us ,  Villa can hardly be surprised when he repeats his antics

17	Lions lost the plot .  Surely the evens Australia wont last till Saturday
17	Bet the Bengals big today .  Like the Packers too ,  but today we see Good Andy Dalton and SD dont live with them . 
17	Western Kentucky  & amp ;  UL Ragin Cajuns two great offenses ,  only one can play defense .  Taking Hilltoppers  - 4
17	Its a practice match ffs ,  some utter and complete shite being talked about this England / Essex game just cos its on Sky
17	More amazing stuff from Puig last night ,  completely deserves to be an All Star
17	Miss Urine having problems with this wee boy  # educatingyorkshire
17	Manchester City a big price ,  no ? 
17	ESPN Player down  =  South Carolina Georgia on Tunein Radio .  Actually enhances the atmosphere
17	Is there some focus group somewhere that finds the adverts with old man Chandler and the Game of Thrones extra amusing ? 
17	Fuck me Harshas out - dramatised the Maddinson six already ! 
17	Terribly I patriotic but the series would benefit hugely from a strong start by Australia

17	Interesting ,  Jags  @  Broncos will be the highest handicap in NFL history

17	Market panic  :  ) 
17	James Hildreth .  Hard to think of anyone else so hyped and so consistently shit
17	So this weekend I was on both Western Kentucky and the NY Giants .  Had a lifetimes worth of turnovers against me in two games  # sigh  # FUMBLEl
17	Vegas completely middled on the first playoff game ;  will be chaos if Saints / Eagles hovers round the field goal at the end
17	Have to think Otago are a bit short here
17	Hard to see the need to use a 7th  -  and apparently inept  -  bowler ,  esp in these circs

17	I think  @ domvilla73 s quiet word with Lambert at Dortmund airport was the breakthrough in the  # Benteke deal .  .  .  . 
17	Could be a lay of the year job if England are faves to chase a middling total on here
17	Why are Sky so obsessed with Wembley NFL ,  by definition those watching arent going ,  so makes no difference to them where it is ? 
17	Couple of key numbers in tonights football .  Public money hopefully pushes us up to Arizona  + 7  & amp ;  North Carolina  + 10 .  Have to take the dogs

17	Id rather have Verlander than Sonny Gray at pick em in a game 5
17	Market very keen on Pak here ,  many a slip possible between here and a lead though
17	Book on the  @ willhillbet Sports Book of Year Longlist called The Metaphysics of Ping Pong .  Surely cops on title alone
17	 @ MrLix public reaction will be interesting ,  because most are like the CSK fan with his head in hands at Badrinaths wicket .  .  .  .

17	Naked eye looked a shocker
17	Local  @ waitrose store putting up Christmas decorations in store .  10th of October . 
17	Do think todays line is an over reaction to Verlanders outing in Oakland .  Slight lean Boston .  LA / St Louis line looks spot on to me
17	Very cool shiny green helmets today from Michigan State .  Like the wrapper on a mint aero

17	Also .   " Matchday One "  is the worst phrase since  " FL72 "  .  Whats wrong with  " Last Wednesday "  ? 
17	 @ nclarke1899 Clear out at trade deadline ?  Not many to market really ,  heard Rios to Cincinnati possible ,  maybe Danks  & amp ;  Peavy to contenders ? 
17	Live events on BT Sport today :  Barnet v Cambridge ,  Nigeria v Ethiopia .  Bet subscribers feel thats money well spent
17	A low total for DET @ CLE but fully justified .  Weeden  +  Browns D  +  hampered Johnson  +  rain  =  somebody wins this 13 - 10
17	Finally got round to reading Sports Illustrateds OSU expose .  Some shocking stuff in Stillwater ,  great reporting though
17	Every incentive for Louisville  & amp ;  Teddy to run it up tonight for the cameras but Rutgers  + 19 is back door cover territory  # pass
17	Will the  @ SkyCricket Sachin programme be one second of a raised finger followed by 59 minutes of funereal silence ?

17	Botham worse than usual today
17	No Baaaaaaallll ! 
17	 @ MrLix yeah absolutely agree
17	Is this teacher on educating Yorkshire really called Miss Urine ? 
17	 @ nclarke1899 weird team this year what Ive seen , they swing at EVERYTHING as well ,  think someone drew a walk in April maybe .  Poorly managed

17	Do you .  .  . dont you .  .  .  .  . or do you just sit helpless whilst the sites fucked ?   # betfair
17	Pretty desperate fare in the Forest  -  West Ham game .  Midday plus kids plus empty seats plus Chiles plus Keane
17	Pregame suggesting public strongly betting Pittsburgh tonight .  I like the Reds  # MLBPostseason
17	Enjoyably farcical scenes in Philly ,  they need an orange ball
17	Browns have two high - pick offers for Josh Gordon .  Hard to see why theyre refusing ,  Jason Campbell wont get it within 10 yards of him
17	Quite fancy Guyana for the Windies T20 at the prices
17	Anyone got a next Villa manager market up ? 
17	Ah ,  the match losing run - a - ball 40 from Ravi coming up ? 
17	The Granderson deal is terrific business for the Mets at a position of need
17	England properly going round the park on SS2
