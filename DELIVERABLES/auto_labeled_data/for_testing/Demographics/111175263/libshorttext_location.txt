30	 @ newyscruggs  @ BoycottJerry  @ nfl not in Dallas you mean
30	 @ BryanBroaddus I am reading online there are changes going to be made with regards to assistant coaches have you heard anything
30	 @ VancityManpurse  @ RapSheet  @ AdamHBeasley could be worst look at the browns and look my Cowboys we been rebuilding since 1997 with No GM
30	 @ BenRogers  @ MattBarrieESPN no it the talent on this team that has to get better and it starts by drafting and not missing on draft picks
30	 @ jonmorosi  @ FOXSports1 have a feeling you will be reporting by noon today the lions will be firing their head coach
30	 @ JasonLaCanfora you sound surprised that unusual from a well run organization like the Redskins .  .  .  I almost said this with straight face
30	 @ NFLosophy  @ gregauman you think he is regretting his decision to sign in Tampa
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl I dont .  diets are temporary changing eating habits and life style Changes are better long term
30	 @ VancityManpurse  @ RapSheet  @ AdamHBeasley If the GM goes I would think the entire staff is gone then your talking about a rebuild
30	 @ RapSheet  @ AdamHBeasley I would say dolphins are looking for a new OC
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ 5KStone  @ tovash10 you have to draft well
30	 @ RealStevenJames I am not sure who does either but I watch the draft coverage and can see that JJ like to gamble a lot trade up  /  down
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ ScottPrivott and at his age and lack of production this year the trade value is nothin more than likely takes a pay cut
30	 @ RealStevenJames true Jerry is going to have to change his thinking and give the draft more priority and listen to his player development
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ RealStevenJames then supplement your roster thru free agency
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ RealStevenJames even with those cuts I dont see them being major players in free agency .  .  .  You have to build through draft
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ RealStevenJames Austin and Carr I heard Ware is willing to take a pay cut to stay
30	 @ calvinwatkins he may want to think about it because his defense stunk all year
30	 @ coopmavs actually they may want to watch  # 14 of the  # Stars
30	8 - 8 is a miracle with the lack of talent on this team
30	Ball game bad int by Orton
30	 @ Twerley62 I hate to keep saying this but Cowboys defense needs to make a big play
30	Big play by 88
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ DrewPearsonShow it was a dumb play call a roll out with Orton
30	cowboys season in the balance on this drive have to get a touchdown
30	 @ JJT _ ESPNDallas problem is that the cowboys offense has is lacking in the red zone and having to settle for field goals
30	Cowboys need to hold Eagles to a field goal a touchdown here and could be game over
30	Cowboys team MVP will be Dan Bailey
30	 # 57 on Cowboys defense has been nice find
30	They go for it on 4 and 1 and that the play they call not sure that could play call with Orton in at QB
30	 @ Twerley62 are you surprised that we have still not seen any play action
30	Witten limping off the field time for rest of the offense to setup
30	 @ Twerley62 especially with the cowboys fan base they are like the Yankees expect championships or bust
30	 @ Twerley62 this team has not quit on Garrett have been fighting
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ Browns not to mention the ownership situation is a little sticky
30	 @ newyscruggs and that why the have run through head coaches like I run through dt cokes
30	Dallas defense has look really good tonight and another 3 and out Cowboys with a chance to take the lead on there next possession
30	Have to settle for three after the turnover that could come back and haunt the team
30	Cowboys offense needs a touchdown here
30	 @ espn _ macmahon still should have been going
30	Nice play by Dallas defense just what we needed
30	 @ Twerley62 been surprised on how they have kept McCoy bottled up
30	 @ Twerley62 agreed
30	 @ Twerley62 defense has been a nice surprise Monty has stepped up on his play calls
30	 @ Twerley62 so far the offense has look Good like to see some play action deep down the field
30	Another Hard count gets the eagles off sides
30	big stop for  # Cowboys  defense
30	Start of 2nd half real important if  @ dallascowboys want to stay in the game
30	 @ TimCowlishaw  @ Edwerderespn maybe they were thinking about going for it on 4th down
30	 @ JasonLaCanfora they may want to also look at the fact that they dont have a QB or a RB
30	 @ espn _ macmahon that should have been caught
30	 @ Twerley62 agreed
30	 @ Twerley62 man on a mission  # 29 in beast mode and give the o - line some props has some nice holes to run through like to see some playaction
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ Browns  @ BlueStarBlog might need a big drink instead of a hug
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ Browns  @ JayGlazer which organization is more dis functional Browns or Cowboys
30	 @ espn _ macmahon no still a bust one nice play doesnt make a career
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl tonight might be the last time we see him in a  # Cowboys  jersey
30	 @ Twerley62 nice leap from # 89
30	 @ BenRogers is tonight the last time we see Myles Austin in a  # Cowboys jersey
30	 @ AdamSchefter  @ mortreport which organization is more dysfunctional  # Browns or  # Cowboys
30	 @ JJT _ ESPNDallas first D -  Ware sighting of the season
30	 @ espn _ macmahon Tim its a process we are trying to win in all three phases of the game .  .  .  .  .  Lol
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl why not I have already started myself
30	 @ darrenrovell NO ,  NO ,  NO
30	 @ calvinwatkins to make things interesting .  .  .  Considering I did not know they were going this way with it means it didnt work
30	 @ calvinwatkins bailey ,  hatcher maybe got snubbed the rest considering who made it ahead of them not really
30	 @ sbass1310 I know right best part of the movie coming up
30	 @ SportsSturm its a wonderful life also deserves a movie review as well
30	 @ newyscruggs yes but only if he replaces himself as GM changing Head Coach does no good unless you clean house
30	 @ SportsSturm had D - ware pressure the QB all season entire defense has M . I . A all year
30	 @ iamelf I think he is gone either way they dont win or lose today next week against the eagles they have no chance of winning
30	 @ calvinwatkins did he make the trip ? 
30	 @ bhorn55 I think we all been asking that question all season
30	1st down redskins thats ball game
30	 @ CashSports lol thats funny
30	 @ espn _ macmahon I guess that all Jerry wants
30	 @ Edwerderespn I dont think the left foot was down
30	 @ DavidMooreDMN I dont think its going to happen either way
30	Can you hear that sound that the Cowboys season being flushed down the drain and hopefully the entire front office and coaching staff
30	 @ aandro and also spring training just around the corner
30	 @ Twerley62 M . I . A all season long
30	 @ BenRogers turn in you playbook
30	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 over / under on how long Garrett and the coaching staff are fired after the game
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ RiverJordan3  @ clarencehilljr under
30	 @ newbury1310 that would require the cowboys to be creative with their play calls .  .  .  Plus the smart thing to day cowboys are neither
30	 @ mattmosley I guess 50 million dollars doesnt get much in the NFL just a below average player
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl yes
30	 @ BenRogers close is still a question mark I would love for them to get Balfour at 2 for 15
30	 @ MikeBacsik not yet still uneasy about the bullpen
30	 @ benjihana  @ JonHeymanCBS merry Christmas Texas Rangers fans
30	 @ calvinwatkins to bad cowboys dont subscribe to this philosophy
30	 @ SportsDayDFW I think Drew Pearson should  # theoriginal88
30	 @ Twerley62 thanks you too
30	 @ Twerley62 same here have Reggie Bush on my team
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ danny24fan  @ BradChadwick a lack of talent on this team goes back to bad drafts .  Look and learn from the NE Patriots
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ jimjoyz talent is not everything guys like zack Thomas were always told they were too slow ,  too small . 
30	 @ Twerley62 rational football minds also seem to be scarce at Valley Ranch for the last 17 years
30	 @ Twerley62 nothin would change except the name plate by the head coaches office .  .  .  Just like the Oakland Raiders under  Al Davis
30	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ dallasbhinson53 can we say another bad decision by the GM
30	 @ EsqNamedDrew  @ BenRogers nope they didnt notice he was there
30	 @ gfraley  @ Twerley62 who else would draft Gavin Escobar and pass on Eddie Lacey .  .  .  .  Jerry jones the root of all bad personal decisions
30	 @ TicketRadio here is another one Cowboys draft Gavin Escobar and pass on Eddie Lacy .  .  ,  who was more productive today ? 
30	 @ NFLCharean  @ newyscruggs does it really matter its the same result either way
30	 @ TicketRadio what for baseball season only 62 days till spring training starts
30	 @ gfraley very true I guess we are now the Oakland Raiders of the NFC run one head coach after another with same result 8 - 8  ,  7 - 9
30	 @ gfraley not always the head coach fault this starts at the top Jerry jones is the only one who has been around over the last 17 years
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ dallascowboys 7 - 9 would be my bet
30	 @ iamelf a lot probably the best QB they will face in the last 3 or 4 weeks could be a long day for cowboys defense
30	 @ espn _ durrett actually not really the coverage Green Bay was in Beasley was correct romo misread the coverage
30	 @ mattmosley it was Austin this time
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl cant fix stupid
30	 @ theoldgreywolf nope
30	 @ espn _ macmahon dont count on McCarthy know what he is doing unlike Garrett and the cowboys
30	“ @ newyscruggs :  I guess everybody but the guy who went to Princeton thinks they should run the ball .   # Cowboys”
30	 @ coopmavs no cowboys think they are smarter then anyone else in the league
30	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 I am glad someone else had notice that the cowboys have only ran the ball 17 times in a game they were up by 21 at one point
30	 @ newyscruggs their is always way remember these are the Cowboys finding new and impressive ways to lose a game
30	 @ bhorn55 Kyle Wilber
30	 @ iamelf Mack brown will stay no one better out there
30	 @ nickeatman  @ newyscruggs I guess 50 million dollars doesnt get much in todays NFL
30	 @ BenRogers no longer buying season tickets
30	 @ aandro probably Choo and Morales the only ones I would say could help
30	 @ Evan _ P _ Grant what about Choo I hear Yankees are taking a look at his services
30	 @ espn _ macmahon just burnt out 50 million dollar corner
30	 @ BryanBroaddus is it just me but a weird game giants lead in time of possession ,  total yards but trail 14 -  6 Cowboys offense still bad
30	 @ MikeHeika what the deal .  I was reading that Vernon Fiddler has requested a trade ? 
30	 @ espn _ macmahon how about the excuses for the GM who hired all the coaches
30	 @ RapSheet no just lucky
30	 @ espn _ macmahon yea right
30	 @ SportsDayDFW  @ MikeHeika yes like Alex Goligoski
30	 @ NFLosophy hey they are beating the teams on there schedule jags only won two games last year and they cant buy a win this year
30	 @ SkinWade I would say 15
30	 @ TicketRadio Jerry jones will say that this was a moral victory because AP didnt get 391 yards on the ground against are defense
30	 @ benjihana  @ EveryDaysAnOdeh watch  # stars hockey a lot more enjoyable
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl yes yes yes same old cowboys
30	 @ Edwerderespn they are playing the cowboys the Vikings will still win this game
30	 @ bctc100  @ ThatSportsGirl note as long as Jerry Jone is owner and GM we are now the Al Davis Oakland raiders
30	 @ ThatSportsGirl only the cowboys could make a 1 - 6 team look like a 6 - 1 team
30	 @ newyscruggs  @ NFLCharean its a lost season already doesnt really matter
30	 @ espn _ macmahon Cowboys finding new and improbable was to lose games since 1997
30	 @ BryanBroaddus so they can go three and out and punt .  .  .  Vikings return the punt for a touchdown to put the game out of reach
30	 @ SportsSturm at least there is good hockey game going so us at home can watch a team that plays hard  # Stars
30	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 score update the best team in Dallas  # Stars are leading 2 - 0 over Ottawa
30	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 now which team is 1 - 6 the Vikings look like the better team cowboys look like the 1 - 6 team
30	 @ newyscruggs not much to say after a performance like that this year defense looks worst than last years
30	 @ Slatersnews just another 8 - 8 season
30	 @ espn _ macmahon I didnt realize he was playing havent seen him out in the field a whole lot
30	 @ NFLosophy who cant win the big games
