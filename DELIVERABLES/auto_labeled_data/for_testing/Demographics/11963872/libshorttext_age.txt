-0.42	 @ antbaena 
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness a Pi would take years to mine even a single coin .  The processing power needed is massive ,  but deliberately so . 
-0.42	 @ imyke  @ mattalexand  @ viticci mykestories [ dot ] net
-0.42	Awesome job ,    @ kylelambert !   & gt ;  This Incredible Portrait of Morgan Freeman Was Painted on an iPad 
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness try explaining how the stock market works to normal folk ! 
-0.42	 @ antbaena Into Darkness was a proverbial shit floating in the bowler hat of remakes . 
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness in an apple store ?  specialist tends to be most popular .  genius isnt as glamorous as its made out to be
-0.42	 @ heidivodka lost it at this 
-0.42	Santas grotto at The Grove 
-0.42	But on the plus side ,  my iPhone 5 was replaced .  Apparently the battery was also faulty in addition to the camera . 
-0.42	 @ ismh 
-0.42	And the world survives another solar orbit .  Kudos . 
-0.42	 @ sheepfred very true ! 
-0.42	 @ thedoyle Thats one of my favourites ! 
-0.42	Seriously ,  funniest movie ever . 
-0.42	 @ heidivodka 
-0.42	iPhone camera has this weird mark ,  lens is clean and scratch free .  Seems a Genius Bar visit is needed 
-0.42	 @ marcoarment Welch doesnt have a shit list ,  its just a single text file containing a wildcard character . 
-0.42	 @ thedoyle  @ iKylez hunted * 
-0.42	Back in Blighty
-0.42	 @ mrjosereyes 
-0.42	 @ iKylez awesome .  Wonder if  @ thedoyle will be in the country .  .  . 
-0.42	 @ imyke it was the same for Forza 3 on 360 which was two discs .  Disc 2 had to be installed to the hard drive before you could play it . 
-0.42	Its a Christmas miracle !  RT  @ justinbieber :  My beloved beliebers Im officially retiring
-0.42	 @ fneb agreed ,  but it’s a step in the right direction and the pardon is more symbolic of the acceptance of the “crime” being absurd . 
-0.42	 @ imyke the beauty of podcasts is that geography is never an issue . 
-0.42	 @ staroversky I was in an Apple Store and they were literally putting them on the shelves . 
-0.42	 @ caseyliss  @ marcoarment  @ siracusa   @ hotdogsladies I think I just crossed the streams 
-0.42	Anyone making those claims will receive a swift kick to the shins and paper cuts between their toes . 
-0.42	 @ johnny _ winter  @ Penderworth woah ,  woah .  I wont hear a bad word uttered about the Creme Egg .  Anyone who doesnt enjoy them is a communist

-0.42	 @ tumtumtum Thanks ,  glad it isnt just me then ! 
-0.42	 @ AmazonHelp and now Amazon have admitted part of my order was given to the wrong courier and has no idea where it is .  What a shambles
-0.42	Ive ordered the parts and have even grabbed a few bargains in the Steam sale . 
-0.42	 @ heidivodka Riker is making me question certain lifestyle choices 
-0.42	Quite impressed with the Jawbone UP24 I picked up in LA .

-0.42	 @ imyke  " Give me your number ,  your boots and your motorcycle " 
-0.42	 @ ismh A few actually got made ,  heres one booting up 
-0.42	So it seems Twitterrific’s notifications will push mentions from blocked users .  Switching back to Tweetbot as that’s not acceptable . 
-0.42	 @ macdrifter thought as much ,  just looked into it and iCloud can restore all passwords but only to same device ,  not a new one . 
-0.42	That was a damn good Reuben
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness Ive used it previously between iOS ,  Mac and Android .  Has always worked flawlessly .  The apps are great . 
-0.42	 @ apkawel  @ drdrang  @ macdrifter  @ techdiffpodcast ironically ,  I unfollowed  @ iAWriter for their tasteless and illogical use of the patent system
-0.42	 @ Zite  @ johnny _ winter this is actually getting  * worse *  .  Almost ready to ditch the app completely . 
-0.42	 @ fneb I assume  " poor health "  isnt a good enough reason for doctors appointments with them ? 
-0.42	 @ johnny _ winter  @ Zite Same here .  Getting a  * lot *  of articles about subjects Ive got no interest in that are of a questionable content
-0.42	 @ fneb if I had a bigger budget ,  Id go Intel .  Though AMD will be more than enough for my needs now and in the future
-0.42	 @ mattalexand 20 ICICLES YOU WONT BELIEVE ARE JUST FROZEN WATER  - BuzzFeed
-0.42	 @ iKylez I can see !  If youre not working at Pixar or ILM by next week then something has gone wrong in the world . 
-0.42	 @ fneb AMD works best for my budget and the performance between 1 / 2 sticks of RAM is about 2 - 3 %  ,  but lets me upgrade easier down the road
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness yep .  Can’t be bothered with a next - gen console ,  plus the game prices are just too much
-0.42	 @ Glinner A fair and coherent response to a poorly written and anonymous forum post that has the internet up in arms ?  How dare you ! 
-0.42	 @ neilcochrane1 haha !  I have no such excuse .  .  .  But Ill still watch it guilt - free ! 
-0.42	Multiple vaults in  @ 1Password is just brilliant
-0.42	Best ever purchase at a pound shop 
-0.42	 @ johnny _ winter Have had a few other people say the same thing .  How long ago ?  I thought the stores were able to replace the camera part now
-0.42	 @ fneb no ,  the music !   : p

-0.42	 @ macdrifter  @ collis yep ,  really sad to see it go . 
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness or its alternate title  " Percy Jackson and the Harry Potter lawsuit "  . 
-0.42	 @ Penderworth  @ tutsplus excellent !  I’ve recently started using Lightroom so will be reading this through
-0.42	 @ squeeby 
-0.42	 @ fneb finally started a gaming rig build ! 
-0.42	Great work Amazon .  Part of my order was “misrouted” and was given to the wrong courier ,  and they don’t know which . 
-0.42	PC Assemble !  
-0.42	 @ johnny _ winter sounds like itd be a whole unit swap then !  Thats actually preferable as mine is a little on the scratched side  :  )

-0.42	Back from Dusseldorf
-0.42	As someone who has the pleasure of knowing  @ kylelambert and seeing him work first hand ,  its disheartening to hear people claim hes a fraud
-0.42	 @ fneb Ta !  Been playing a lot of FTL recently .  Hoping No Mans Sky gets a release but after the studios flood ,  not sure itll be this year

-0.42	 @ staroversky the sleep tracking and app integration to third party services sold it to me .

-0.42	Writer Pro Developers Double Down on Innovations in Being Douchebags :  
-0.42	 @ staroversky I was considering the Fuelband SE but as I use the Nike running app ,  the Jawbone offered more features and integration .

-0.42	 @ iKylez same again unfortunately  :  (  wish I was still working from home !  !  !

-0.42	Its almost time for Brian Butterfields Christmas Pizza 
-0.42	I was under the impression restoring from an iCloud backup would also restore account passwords ?  Had to enter most of them again…

-0.42	 @ danielmartyn if you can make a tiled version ,  Ill make you feel good
-0.42	 @ OliverMCarding 
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness Good God ,  it was glorious .  I still maintain 3D is superfluous ,  but it has to be watched in IMAX to truly experience it . 
-0.42	 @ Penderworth efficient and to the point .  I kid ,  loved it . 
-0.42	 @ RichHarkness I’ve been researching it more recently ,  too .  Very interesting stuff !  I know someone who has a dedicated mining rig for bitcoin
-0.42	 @ macdrifter wish I’d done an iTunes backup first now .  iCloud backup never restores quite right
-0.42	 @ staroversky its actually pretty great .  Lack of display isnt a problem ,  always have my iPhone on me ,  and the app works really well .
