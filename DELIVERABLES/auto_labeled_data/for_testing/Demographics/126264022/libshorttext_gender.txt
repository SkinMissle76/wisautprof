-1	Amazing duck roast for 2nd Christmas  ( latest one ever )  in Devon .  One of the best traditions of divorced parents !  
-1	Another Christmas tradition .  Get this from my bro every year  -  loving the slight hint on the wrapping !  
-1	Yay  -  have found my new home in Poole .  And cars been serviced .  A successful and productive day  :  -  ) 
-1	Heres something I designed myself at the Irish Post Museum  # veryproud  @ ClokeRoom 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan You regularly seem to confuse asking questions with making points on your personal view .  The two wont always align .  3 / 3
-1	 @ Leilanimitchel It was very good .  No balance of light / dark we often get  -  left me feeling just disappointed and angry with parts of society . 
-1	 @ BenJames22  @ ridgwaytim  @ journoannie  @ Lummers80 Cynic in me wonders if update would have run quicker / wider if outcome was the opposite .  .  . 
-1	Valve two had same damage ,  but it totally exploded off when I took the dust cap off .  Tire completely deflated .  
-1	 @ Dweezil1968 Im thankful it wasnt more serious and all repaired now so back on the road .  Dealer were excellent to fit it in quickly . 
-1	Why have I only just discovered this place .  Amazing concept !   (  @  Burger Brothers )  
-1	Sadly an early night for this lad after him and his mates let off rookies near crowd at  # LewesBonfire 
-1	This one looks like  @ SusPolPLO at work RT  @ eddiehphoto Police doing a cracking job at Balcombe  # fracking protest 
-1	 @ mwilliamsthomas Its really odd .  Not aware of damage to any other cars ,  but had driven away before warning came on .  Did you see the pics ? 
-1	 @ vickyohare Pretty good thanks but crazily busy at the mo .  App developed by our excellent department web guru Lee .  Happy to speak any time . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan have an requirement to answer someone who swears ,  repeats points angrily because they cant accept reasonable delays and 2 / 3
-1	London Irish vs Stade Francais  (  @  Madejski Stadium  -   @ londonirishpubs w /  7 others )  
-1	 @ ClokeRoom  @ GilesJust  # indeed
-1	 @ journoannie Is this job you complained about ?  If so ,  seems your first awareness of it was public tweet sent to us .  Hows that exclusive ? 
-1	 @ GarethDeanPR  @ baakrjacks Really nasty and calculated .  Lucky car has tire pressure warning .  Went off very quickly after driving for a bit . 
-1	RT  @ ClokeRoom Wish Id thought of Crusty Springfield now .  .  . 
-1	 @ Petuniarobin Its been sorted now thankfully .  Dealer was very quick to schedule in the repair .  Suspect foul play esp as two damaged . 
-1	 @ Leilanimitchel Agreed  -  generalisation doesnt help .  Although those doing profession most harm are therapists offering that treatment . 
-1	 @ HughDougherty Point was ,  we did yesterday  ( and today )  but paper in question still chose to run none of it to balance their story . 
-1	 @ pearsallphoto  @ Petuniarobin Im going back to my old stomping grounds and the first force I worked for to be head of dept at Dorset Police . 
-1	Some utter  *  *  *  *  has vandalised my car .  Valves on both passenger side tires sheared off ,  dust caps put back on .  Quick ,  dangerous punctures . 
-1	 @ JonathanCorke I thought my team had given you what they had ?  Albeit not full unredacted report I presume youve requested though FoIA ?  1 / 3
-1	Its got real rejection issues  :  -  (  
-1	Following my toast rejection pic .  .  .  RT  @ ClokeRoom Followed by a rendition of Dusty Springfields Stand by your Jam . 
-1	 @ SurreyPolice colleague PC Gaynor Grout wins  # BBCHeroes 999 award after 25 +  years service and focus on neighbourhood policing . 
-1	 @ moving _ mogul Id driven away a little bit before warning came on but luckily before any serious damage .  A very sneaky / nasty tactic . 
-1	Hello Brighton seafront rainbow .  Lovely view from the pier even with the earlier rain .  
-1	 @ ClokeRoom  @ alcxxk Couldnt have missed me earlier  -  in the hi - vis for work ,  but now booked off and enjoying it as a resident . 
-1	 @ eddiehphoto Nope !  Think I was wearing a black coast and brown t shirt . 
-1	Dont think Ill be taking up this offer .  .  .  
-1	 @ LawrenceHobbs being interviewing about policing  # Balcombe protest .  Lots of hard work by my team on this from start .  
-1	 @ JonathanCorke I say presume as FoI are rightly different dept to us and we dont handle or influence FoI process ,  even if from media .  2 / 3
-1	 @ ewajasiewicz Would you be willing / able to take part or could you recommend someone else ?  Ive followed you so can DM reply if youd prefer . 
-1	Love watching TV in a marathon .  Possibly not the best idea for Top Of The Lake tho .  Brilliantly shot and plotted ,  but hauntingly depressing . 
-1	 @ timmus210 Luckily they turned up shortly after and we were there til the wee hours !  Good night out but sad occasion saying goodbye . 
-1	 @ Leilanimitchel He was understandably angry any therapies are misused to cure gay people .  Passion rightly trumped balance sometimes IMHO . 
-1	 @ tpettifor Hopeful focus will be rightly on debating that law says we must hand back ,  not police decision .  Rock and hard place for us !  2 / 2
-1	 @ offthecuffjo Nice to meet you and thanks for the follow .  Hope your minds stop spinning with all the stuff crammed into last week ! 
-1	 @ pearsallphoto Ill be working at HQ in the countryside around Wool and probably living in Poole  ( Bournemouth adds ages to commute !  ) 
-1	Lots of change for me in 2014 .  New home ,  new job ,  hopefully making new friends and staying close to my old ones .  Happy new year everyone  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ SC _ S2719  @ DCCGilesYork  @ SgtDaveBennett  @ Petuniarobin We should be able to add number look - up too .  Still think names should be preference . 
-1	 @ HughDougherty He doesnt need to call someone out .  We have a press officer working over weekend due to Balcombe .  Reporter can contact them . 
-1	 @ sussex _ police PC Paul Tobutt nominated  # bbcheroes 999 award for 28yrs frontline service .  Highly respected  & amp ;  nominated by Lewes colleagues . 
-1	 @ journoannie Happy to take to email  -  you raised it here hence response here .  Agree the tweet wasnt your only source ,  but it was the first . 
-1	Get the picture on burglary across Sussex and follow some simple steps to protect your home  # opmagpie 
-1	Lovely afternoon walking around Lewes .  Dont always appreciate whats on your own doorstep .  
-1	Looks like a Bronze commander with  @ HantsPolice mutual aid MT  @ eddiehphoto Police at Balcombe  # fracking protest 
-1	 @ ChrisGee9 Theyve probably wasted more than that printing it .  Not my usual supermarket so if anyone wants it .  .  .  Collect in person only obv ! 
-1	Last minute decision to drive up now worked a treat .  No dodgy weather and hardly anyone on roads .  Easy way to cover 350 miles !  Now to bed .  .  . 
-1	 @ ewajasiewicz We met briefly at Balcombe last Mon  -  impromptu interview for documentary by Felix .  Have offer / invitation for you to consider . 
-1	Really excited about the line up for  # 10DaysLive today .  Were I not on holiday ,  would be joining it with as much as possible .   # takepart
-1	 @ michael _ taggart Well spotted !  Very much here in a formal capacity and humbled by those much more deserving nominees who are here . 
-1	Bangers cant be used in crowds .  Some of these were being thrown .  Have fun but dont spoil your night  # LewesBonfire 
-1	Brilliant afternoon out at Ashdown Forest Llama Park .  This fella is a bit of a poser !  
-1	 @ ridgwaytim  @ journoannie Do either of you know why taser outcome not published yet ?  Not personal criticism ,  but Argus has a responsibility . 
-1	 @ HughDougherty If youre still having problems getting in touch ,  follow and DM me so I can send you details for media officer whos working . 
-1	 @ SussexPol _ Photo Love your photos Chris .  Thanks for sharing them .  Disappointed Ive only just come across them  -  about to go on a RT frenzy ! 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan who found it informative and watched from home rather than increasing visitors ,  so the opposite to your assumption .  4 / 4
-1	Brilliant film but incredibly dark .   ( at  @ OdeonCinemas for Prisoners )  
-1	 @ scrapperduncan partnership approach .  We purposefully did not show long ,  entertainment type shots of the event after discussion with 2 / 4
-1	 @ scrapperduncan Engage and show people how we work  -  get criticised .  Or be criticised for lack of transparency .  Cant win with you it seems ! 
-1	 @ ewajasiewicz Reviewing how we communicate during demos / protests and want real useful feedback from all parties to learn ,  share and improve . 
-1	Sainsburys Brand Match  # winning 
-1	Great to look back to the  # SPPlive event over the summer 
-1	 @ mwilliamsthomas At home its secure off - road ,  only leaving work car park  ( also secure and hopefully unlikely )  or short stop in Lewes town . 
-1	At a beer and cider festival .  Ideal for a non - drinker !  Continuing the theme from Ireland though .   (  @  Cogges Farm )  
-1	Setting off on the long drive back from Yorkshire to Sussex now so that I can work tomorrow .  Fingers crossed for a smooth journey . 
-1	 @ HughDougherty I criticised  " some media "  and the whole point was we werent given a right to reply by those in question yesterday . 
-1	 @ brightonargus Given how prominent your original story was ,  why havent you informed public of outcome since Friday ?  
-1	Good idea by AG to start publishing advice to public  & gt ;  BBC News  -  Social media users warned over court case comments 
-1	 @ rapella I dont think managing public perception should tip into such operational micro - management .  Sounds like spin over practicality . 
-1	Only problem coming to  # Carnival with such a big group is that weve literally spent more time waiting for people to use loos than dancing ! 
-1	It really annoys me publishers put trailers and adverts at the start of DVDs and Blurays lately .  Bad enough in cinema let alone at home ! 
-1	 @ JonathanCorke However ,  I can see date of request from your earlier Tweet .  Have unrelated meeting with FoI head tomorrow but will raise .  3 / 3
-1	 @ johndmccormick I have done .  Its just the cheek of them doing it in the first place ! 
-1	 @ DIBeckyMolyneux I started at Dorset Police and moved up for the jobs .  Now moving back cos right job is there .  Let me know when you visit . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan partners and societies .  No evidence of it encouraging any tourists or increasing numbers ,  but are comments from people 3 / 4
-1	 @ HughDougherty  @ ChiefBTP Ive agreed with you on that already .  We had media officer working so control room should have passed on details . 
-1	 @ GilesJust Welcome to the wonderful world of Twitter sir !  It will start to consume your life if you let it .  .  .   ;  ) 
-1	At another team members leaving do to be greeted by empty tables .  Getting paranoid theyve given a different venue !  
-1	 @ CISimonNelson Yeah .  And pancakes when Im feeling really naughty . 
-1	 @ SgtDaveBennett  @ Petuniarobin Theres no reason why we cant look at an option of name or warrant number .  The details are from MINT . 
-1	 @ BenJames22  @ ridgwaytim  @ journoannie Thanks for quick answers .  Still dont understand why its online two days late and after other media . 
-1	Just read in - depth  @ brightonargus interview with  @ LawrenceHobbs about Balcombe policing .  Probing and interesting 
-1	Last time it was Sainsburys ,  this time Tesco .  If I keep playing them off against eachother Ill be a millionaire !  
-1	 @ JonLavis  @ eddiehphoto  @ sussex _ police Indeed .  With such a big flood of police - focused pics thought it best to point out hes independent . 
-1	 @ JonLavis  @ eddiehphoto  @ sussex _ police Agree hes great .  Weve spoken but to be clear ,  hes not working for us and at Balcombe as freelancer . 
-1	 @ ridgwaytim  @ sussex _ police Hi Tim  -  please be more specific .  Was this about a particular incident ,  unhelpful person ,  etc ?  Drop me an email . 
-1	 @ HughDougherty Most media know our details and many have been in touch today but agree re control room reply .  Should have passed on details . 
-1	 @ JenniNut  @ Carrie _ Allen  @ emilyabridges  @ joeyirving As youd probably guess ,  Im excited by the prospect already ! 
-1	Another weekend visit .  Some similarities to last time played Guess The Place so guess away !  
-1	 @ insp _ Lyons I like our cameo  ;  -  )  Even with my very shaved head ! 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan On streaming itself  -  it was designed to be informative and help answer the dozens of queries we get on policing and 1 / 4
-1	One for you lessons  @ ClokeRoom RT  @ GreenClouds4 The most British thing Ive ever read .  
-1	 @ JimJim608 Haha !  Ive not been Nicholas anywhere other than my driving license and passport for decades !   ;  -  ) 
-1	 @ tpettifor Totally get public interest re :  returning non - indecent images of children .  Indeed we started the debate and public awareness .  1 / 2
-1	Goodbye Dublin .  Great place for a city break !   (  @  Departures w /  2 others )   [ pic ]  :  
-1	 @ suspolfootball Nice one Darren ,  well deserved  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  Sussex Polices  " face of football "  receives top award 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan My answers werent  " b *  *  * ocks and you know it "  .  They were honest ,  trying to be helpful and answered your questions .  2 / 3
-1	At another  # LewesSkeptics event but on my own  ( not literally ,  just havent arrived with friends !  )  this time .  
-1	Done the annual Christmas splurge at Cheese Please .  Finally starting to feel festive !  Many hours ahead on the road may change that .  .  . 
-1	Bit of time killing before poker night .   (  @  Empire Cinema for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty )  
-1	 @ FannerJon  @ SamRobins  # MCT  # 10dayslive Have a great day .  I was really looking for to this until I remembered I was on leave ! 
-1	 @ MCTIMrobins I hadnt seen that .  Looks like an interesting way of raising money .  Can put it on the Intranet and see who wants to take part . 
-1	 @ timaharris Sorry  -  Ive really lost your train of thought !  Begging letters ? 
-1	 @ sussex _ police colleague Suchi Chatterjee nominated in  # bbcheroes 999 award for dedication to hate crime and victim care roles in B  & amp ;  H . 
-1	My final Movember effort .  Had to wear it today to show work colleagues as off sick last week 
-1	 @ Ravilious  @ scrapperduncan Ditto .  No major issues .  Some worried if we streamed full event as entertainment ,  but not in limited form we did . 
-1	Tomorrow night Im out with  @ Eastbournepol response .  Part of manager attachments East Sussex are doing .  Will tweet some things and ask Qs . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan Every year people ask how and why we police it in certain ways .  This is a way to show them without them needing to be there . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan  @ Ravilious More support than negativity on channels I can see  -  Twitter ,  online ,  etc but still respect any contrary views . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan Because your point was made in a typically loaded and antagonistic way .  Im all for personal accountability ,  but dont 1 / 3
-1	 @ SuptBracher  @ Gatwick _ Airport Pleased to hear it .  Enjoyed volunteering as a role player today ,  rather than usual media role behind scenes . 
-1	Having the best NYE out Ive had for ages .  Best club night for a long while !   (  @  Casablanca Jazz Club )   [ pic ]  :  
-1	 @ Petuniarobin Its a lovely part of the world and somewhere Ive always hoped to move back to longer - term .  Sure youll be pleased too . 
-1	 @ tryingtobegood  @ mwilliamsthomas Just me and only one car but will check with neighbours and friends .  Thanks for support . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan And your question was answered re :  live streaming  -  by me personally and on our Force account .  You just didnt like answer . 
-1	 @ CI _ Lyons  @ DanPitcher  @ LawrenceHobbs  @ eddiehphoto  @ sussex _ police Seconded .  Thanks for sharing all those pics this evening . 
-1	 @ eddiehphoto Often get 100 +  emails a day so cant always read or respond same day .  Chris has taken his down for now for same reasons as you . 
-1	 @ Dweezil1968 Really bizarre .  But clearly calculated given same damage done to both valves .  About to post picture . 
-1	 @ rapella I dont doubt it !  But that still doesnt mean we can  ( or would want to )  micro - manage such details for comms reasons . 
-1	 @ HantsPolice  @ eddiehphoto Your helmet crests are distinguishable .  Hope your mutual aid ,  other officers and protesters have peaceful weekend . 
-1	Shame some media still cant resist sensation over balance .  .  .  RT  @ sussex _ police Police rebut Balcombe accusations 
-1	 @ BrightonArgusJo  @ benleo89 Absolutely .  Theres been a run of good ones lately .  Like the changed approach of putting longer features online . 
-1	 @ HughDougherty Not in the slightest and Im genuinely insulted at such a loaded accusation .  Would you prefer I named who  " some media "  were ? 
-1	 @ JimJim608 Do you have Jim on MINT ?  If so it should find it .  If you use Jim probably worth updating MINT .  I dont have Nicholas on there ! 
-1	 @ JonLavis  @ SussexPol _ Photo  @ eddiehphoto Agree  -  I love his work and want us to share .  Taken down temporarily to resolve an identity issue . 
-1	 @ silverfox499 Thanks for the follow - back and nice to bump into you during the Hastings broadcast .  Playing tweet catch - up after leave ! 
-1	Yes  -  its that time of the year again .  Annual pilgrimage to  # Carnival .  
-1	 @ Lummers80 Understand BH weekend thin on ground for media .  Ironically we got it our Friday lest we be accused of sitting on it for 4 +  days ! 
-1	 @ eddiehphoto Thanks for sharing these .  That one looks like  @ SusPolPLO ! 
-1	 @ Lummers80 Thanks .  Understandable why original ran fast and wide ,  but many much slower to publish outcome .  Less sensational but important . 
-1	 @ Insp _ Kind Thanks to you and the  @ Eastbournepol NRT A Shift for making me welcome last night .  Stayed out for whole duration  -  learned a lot . 
-1	 @ EUROCHIPS Im not sure what Id add personally ,  but youre welcome to contact the team with the request :  media . hq @ sussex . pnn . police . uk . 
-1	Great idea  @ esccroads .  Live tracking Road gritters a really useful modern public service and naming then a fun touch .  
-1	Bronze commander in conversation with attendees RT  @ eddiehphoto Police at Balcombe  # fracking protest 
-1	 @ SueHeard  @ sussex _ police It looked brill from pics .  Thank goodness not today with the rain !  Thank you to everyone who took part  # 10dayslive
-1	 @ SgtDaveBennett Dont think it works with collar numbers but it could do .  As per  @ Petuniarobin I think names go down better with public . 
-1	 @ carolanngrant  @ OpenEyeComms Thanks both .  A fairly good journey luckily .  Just a bit of traffic near M1 / M25 junction .  Settled at home now  ;  -  ) 
-1	 @ eddiehphoto Yes I was .  I spotted you briefly working near photographer from our team but didnt say hello as you looked very busy !

-1	Two nominees from  @ sussex _ police make the shortlist for the  # BBCHeroes 999 award .  
-1	At the  # BBCHeroes awards .  One of my favourite annual events .  Such a celebration !   (  @  South Lodge Hotel )  
-1	 @ SussexSRP and  @ sussex _ police road safety stand popular as ever at  # shorehamairahow .  
-1	 @ j0annepsi Stopped to inspect  -  as soon as I took dust caps off ,  one valve exploded off straight away .  Other still attached showing damage . 
-1	 @ scrapperduncan whose desire for transparency to them but not to wider public via means they dont like seems itself to be hypocritical .  3 / 3
-1	 @ GD10 Im personally not able to speak  -  tied up in meetings and not subject Im leading on  -  but someone in team will be able to help . 
-1	 @ rapella That must be in your minds eye .  KL is just one of the forces two - letter identifiers . 
-1	 @ BenJames22  @ ridgwaytim  @ journoannie But still not online where original ran prominently .  Obligation to complete circle .  Thanks for reply . 
-1	Heres damaged valve one .  Clear tool marks on valve and even looks like marks on the alloy beside it .  
-1	 @ journoannie No probs .   @ BenJames22 and  @ Lummers80 jumped in quick to advise .  Hope you enjoyed BH weekend .  I did ,  but paying for it now ! 
-1	London Irish versus Stade Francais at Majeski Stadium .  Looking forward to watching some love rugby !
