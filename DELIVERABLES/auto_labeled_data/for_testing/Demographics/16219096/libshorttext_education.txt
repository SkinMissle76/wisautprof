2	I think that this looks like a cool concept :  
2	 @ barnstormed  @ liamgh There was a hype about netbooks though ,  and they are great little cheap nuggets of computing . 
2	 @ barnstormed  @ liamgh You could easily just say that netbooks are just a smaller laptop !  It doesnt mean they dont serve a need though . 
2	 @ barnstormed I wouldnt say its revolutionary ,  although the iPhone was .  Its just an extension on the the technologies developed from that . 
2	 @ kieranyo Its very tasty indeed ! 
2	Awesome ,  just noticed that Google seem to have street viewed most of the UK ,  including Milton Keynes  :  -  )
