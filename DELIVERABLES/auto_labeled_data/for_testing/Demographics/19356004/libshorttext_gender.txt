1	Love web when it offers fix for boring probs :  fix your trackpad .  Cardigan ,  pipe  & amp ;  garden shed beckon :  
1	Interesting graph .  Cycling safety vs cycling rates by country .  Correlation vs causation 
1	Brilliant piece by  @ IanMartin on the deep need to take offence which I found quite offensive to the easily offended .  .  
1	Wonder if  @ guardian or  @ bbcnews will cover this shocker ?  My guess  " right wing mud - slinging etc .  .  .  .  
1	Dear  @ Times _ CS I know IOS programming is bit much for you but do spell error message correctly .  We see it so often 
1	Brilliant column by  @ matthewsyed “Shock exclusive :   top footballer refuses bribe” on the honesty and integrity that goes unreported
1	Sadly  -  toxic waste story red herring  -  body found on Port Meadow : 
1	Rather nice but uncommunicative police people posted at all the gates onto the Meadow
1	Port Meadow  & amp ;  Wolvercote Common Closed  -  slightly odd reports of toxic waste been dumped ?  More soon .  . 
1	Not “all the news that’s fit to print” for  @ guardian and  @ bbcnews but “all the news that fits our bias” . 
1	2 / 2 …exist for  @ guardian and  @ BBCNews .  See these results .   The metropolitan left lives in a bubble of censorship 
1	1 / 2 The bias of leftist media is often selection bias rather than actual reporting bias .  Many stories simply don’t… 
1	Congrats  @ rowan _ UK  -  Will be glad to see you back in action .  Well done and hope recovery continues to be quick
1	Too often  @ guardian seems driven by mean spirited priggery .  How does naming Marine A help justice ,  victim or him ?  
1	Interested  @ Peston to know whether you find those grammar school stats slanted ,  sloppy or just plain hilarious .  Any def of social mobility ? 
1	Very sweet of you  @ tomrutland .  Used to be Oxford undergraduate  -  sadly many years ago !  Thanks for info and I’ll buy the beer if we chat
1	OK thanks  @ tomrutland so to be clear SU Council voted for it and it is elected by vote ? 
1	Do you have figures on number undergraduates  @ tomrutland  @ ousunews who opted out of OUSU ?  Arguably gives option to express dissent ? 
1	Not saying that  @ tomrutland  @ ousunews living wage has no arguments for it but want to know how OUSU sought vote  /  legitimacy for it ? 
1	Do you have  @ tomrutland a link to show when vote was ,  how many voted and how many in favour  /  against ? 
1	the one  @ tomrutland in the tweet I replied to .  Surely OUSU should represent all not just leftists ?  Proper use of cash and resources ? 
1	Interested  @ ousunews to know what a group which represents all undergraduates is doing involved in partisan campaigns ?  Love to hear logic ? 
1	 @ mrnathannelson  @ leguape Restricted means “not for public release” .  Lowest level of security and really not an issue ! 
1	Surely good schools  @ TristramHuntMP  @ UKLabour should not be political football and you should signal clear definite move from past failure ? 
1	This good news from  @ TristramHuntMP 
1	Good summary here  @ JananGanesh 
1	The science is relatively clear  @ JananGanesh  -  about 50 %  of IQ is inherited 50 %  environment  -  studies of identical twins living separately
1	This is great : 
1	 .  . Effect  @ stephentall vital to startups and business .  Efficient fast transport is one of best investments govt can make  -  physical internet
1	Then  @ stephentall we should close motorway and rail system to revive north !  Sure some wealth is sucked to capital but network  /  cluster…
1	On hs2  @ stephentall go to marseille or aix and see evidence .  People can live in south ,  work in Paris and they do  -  it makes dramatic change
1	 @ stephentall honestly i’d avoid .  Tried it  -  software  & amp ;  usability poor compared to iphone .  Camera better than iphone 5 so go for iphone 5s
1	Then  @ DuncanStott stop attacking the capital of small business with Business Rates and Mansion Tax .  Libdems can be wrong .  In this you are .  . 
1	Why don’t you do a startup  @ DuncanStott ?  Experience often combats prejudice better than debate .  You Cable - istas seem to condemn too much
1	 .  . real people’s jobs  @ DuncanStott and penalise hard work and creativity .  Libdems seems to have a weird obsession with stopping that
1	 .  .  buit tired  @ DuncanStott of leftist policy wonks lecturing us about how world would be better if we paid even more .  Heavy taxes destroy .  .  . 
1	We were discussion business rates  @ DuncanStott  -  think you should admit your theory is incorrect .  Those of us who pay big taxes do get .  .  . 
1	Funny  @ DuncanStott how libdems always believe they smugly know best but seldom have real - world experience .   # swiveleyedtheoreticians
1	 @ DuncanStott 
1	IFS :  “Business property is an input into the production process and ,  on efficiency grounds ,  should not be taxed . ”  @ DuncanStott
1	How can it be borne by the landlord ?   @ DuncanStott .  I pay it not them !  It comes out of my bank account .  If I can’t pay then business bust
1	Surely  @ DuncanStott I should know since I pay them !  Think you’re bit inaccurate on this .  Its a tax on business occupant not landlords
1	“NNDR are payable by the occupiers of the premises”  ( N Norfolk )   @ DuncanStott so business rates paid by me as entrepreneur not landlord
1	Thats a bit unfair  @ DuncanStott !  NNDR paid by those who “occupy non - domestic property”  ( Oxford City Council )  .  Landlords only pay when empty
1	Too many libdem dog whistle policies  @ DuncanStott .  Posturing for political gain means serious damage to small business as tax side - effect
1	Bigco avoids corp tax  @ DuncanStott so target Bigco not small business !  Thought libdems supposed to be liberal  ( Manchester )   & amp ;  like startups
1	whereas  @ DuncanStott corp tax is paid on profits  ( so you have cash to pay it )  and hits bigco not startups .  Libdems bit loopy on property tax
1	If you’d run a startup you’d know that fixed cash costs early on can and do kill .  Simple equation is raise bus rates  =  kill more startups
1	Not sure  @ DuncanStott .  Tenants pay business rates 100 %  whether they make profits or not so it kills struggling businesses . 
1	Genuine question  @ DuncanStott .  Why are business rates better than corp tax ?  Surely as fixed not  % profit they can damage ?  Interested .  . 
1	2 / 2 would  @ michele _ paule  @ Oxford _ Labour hand sweeties to all .  Roll on the utopia of debt ,  economic decay ,  vicious fights of nice Mr Millli
1	1 / 1 Gosh  @ michele _ paule  @ Oxford _ Labour if only Brighton had voted Labour then the sun would shine ,  lambs gambol in the field and Bo Peep…
1	You’re spot on  @ KenBobPryde .  Hadn’t thought of it like that .  Pray that print and journalism can survive else civilisation somewhat stuffed
1	 @ jenkerro  @ leguape they’ll be in roscoff and st Malo  -  local restaurants will have their own fisherman and speak English  -  try viamichelin
1	 @ jenkerro  @ leguape they should be able to put you in touch and tell them it will help exports  -  other route is go via wholesalers
1	 @ jenkerro  @ leguape unlikely to find one who speaks English but tourist office will and they should want publicity 
1	Although this bit Im more culturally tuned in to 
1	Been to many French weddings but never quite get used to cultural difference !  Chateau de Sully ,  Burgundy 
1	 @ ScottSeamons I’m a huge Tebbit fan and love reading or listening to him even when I don’t agree  -  he is echt Essex  -  land of my fathers
1	Not offended  @ ScottSeamons at all  -  swear away .  Pleasures of being Tory is making lefties hot and bothered  -  although persuasion wins votes
1	No  @ ScottSeamons free market is usually best practical solution but requires law ,  intervention and endless change .  It’s a fact not ideology
1	Leftists  @ ScottSeamons so smugly certain of moral superiority that swearing at opponents ok ?  Are good manners reactionary construct comrade ? 
1	Speaking as a  *  *  *  *  Tory  @ ScottSeamons no xenophobia and the free market is not and cannot be an ideology  -  it’s the best practical solution
1	I don’t follow you or  @ lionelbirnie  @ KenBobPryde for political prejudices but cycling pleasure  -  couldn’t you post politics with other acct ? 
1	Sigh  @ KenBobPryde .  Cycling journalists win public followers due to status and exploit it with shouty leftist rants for selfish satisfaction
1	This is really good and hugely reassuring given past Rohan Silva on government IT 
1	Wonder how the literary theory loons would reply to this or would they even try ?  Dinosaurs still in Oxford 
1	 @ LabourLeft  @ michele _ paule is that official party policy ?  Not arguing with your view but interested to know if that is definite party plan ? 
1	Time to trash skyscrapers  -  the tumescence enhancer for developers .  Achitecture still lost in the last century  
1	 @ dalestetina all our thoughts and prayers with you and family  -  sure it will be a long road but you’ll get there and we’re with you . 
1	The Sleepwalkers  @ NickCohen4 by Christopher Clark .  Brilliant read on WWI buildup and uncanny links to pol now ,  Middle East ,  slide to war
1	Just when you thought centre of Birmingham was as ugly  & amp ;  inhuman as it could get ,   @ BhamCityCouncil prove you wrong 
1	Panic over !  I’m back in Oxford after far too long away  -  really quite lovely seen through less familiar eyes and a slightly tired brain
1	De Gaulle wrote the rules  @ afneil of 5th republic .  Whole point was to bin “weak parliamentary democracy”  & amp ;  president close omnipotent
1	Suggest  @ stephenpollard we build framework to fix whole Mid East with partners .  Needs decades of effort and money not few cruise whizz bangs
1	Let’s see  @ stephenpollard the detailed achievable plan  -  the British Army is not paramilitary wing of “progressive” utopian opinion
1	Military action  @ stephenpollard must be defined ,  achievable  & amp ;  have political objective  -  not about making “progressive” liberals feel good
1	This part argument  @ stephenpollard  -  point is where we can act morally  -  practicality all  & amp ;  missiles useless gesture 
1	Late reply  @ ScottSeamons sorry on hols .  Interesting view on BBC and one I hadn’t heard before  -  wonder why it’s stagnated ? 
1	Good balanced piece on fracking by  @ EconSciTech worth reading whatever your opinion 
1	The problem is leaders  @ KenBobPryde that have no military past  /  sense of horror of war  -  what is the pol aim that war might achieve ? 
1	I completely agree with you  @ KenBobPryde
1	That’s interesting  @ ScottSeamons  ( no sarcasm )  .  Why ?  I think bbc is left biased but still support it’s existence although hope more balance
1	No  @ DuncanStott shows public got MPs they voted for not chosen by pol party fiat .  Political parties are necessary fudge not divine right
1	Confused  @ DuncanStott AV referendum was clear .  Do we keep asking until people give “right” result or even impose “progressive” opinion ? 
1	Fascinating article on how animals getting fatter not just us and theories on why  -  worth a read 
1	No coincidence  @ rozoulay  @ yojimbo23  @ benmumbycroft given the quality of founders and tech startups we saw at ISIS presentation  :  -  ) 
1	Hissy fit on hiring of Jim Messina shows UK leftists odd belief that Democrat  =  left  =  libdemlabour .  Whole US politics “right” of UK Tories
1	Also  @ DuncanStott benefits paid only to those who work  /  seek work so seems like Clinton Workfare or IDS Tory reform  -  glad you approve  ;  -  ) 
1	Difference  @ DuncanStott is no technobabble about bitcoin and closer to IDS ‘universal credit’  -  may be good idea  -  little detail in article
1	Are you  @ DuncanStott pointing at Cyprus ,  crippled by euro ,  social breakdown and Russian money as example we should follow ?  Seems bad idea  ;  ) 
1	Drains feeling quite overcome by recent events 
1	St Giles mildly moist a few minutes ago after thunderstorm 
1	2 / 2 Nye Bevan  @ DuncanStott  ( Weekly Argus )  when he was housing minister .  Tragic that today left are “desiccated calculating machines” vs him
1	1 / 2  @ DuncanStott “I am fed up with hearing about workmens types of houses .   .  .  A rabbit - warren accomodation leads to a rabbit - warren mind . 
1	If I did  @ DuncanStott then I apologise  :  )   trying to say that human happiness is aim and is complex  -  formulaic rabbit hutches not answer
1	And you insist on typecasting  @ DuncanStott anyone that doesn’t see reality as 5 - year tractor plan  
1	Sure numbers are roughly correct  @ DuncanStott but you selectively misquote to fit argument which is black  /  white 
1	OCC mocks development that is not leninist - concretist  @ DuncanStott as “windfalls” .  They want big ,  ugly  & amp ;  monotonous .  Ring road  =  River Oder
1	OCC cores strategy  @ DuncanStott only talks “strategic” projects i . e .  housing “estates” or business “parks”  -  no thought to human identity
1	Then the “data”  @ DuncanStott is fiddled like so much of the numbers used by OCC in its development plans  -  facts altered to fit politics
1	Figures can’t be right  @ DuncanStott Castle Mill horror alone is hundreds of flats .  My concern is building beautifully in the right place
1	In Oxford  @ DuncanStott we have leftist big government promoting interest of concreteists  -  think in slogans and despise the little guy
1	 .  @ DuncanStott have you even glanced at Oxford Leninist 10yr plan “Core Strategy” .  No mention of beauty ,  small business or small developers
1	 @ DuncanStott so let concreteists loose on fusty old Oxford ,  make it as ugly and inhumane as Swindon ,  big profit and juicy gerrymandering
1	 @ richardmoore73 that was seriously funny or at Lear funny that I took you seriously ! 
1	 @ KenBobPryde We’re friends with diff politics ,  shared humanity  & amp ;  passion for cycling !  Opinions can be wrong ,  beliefs false but both human
1	 @ richardmoore73 he’s right about rowing .  I’ve done both .  Involves every muscle  & amp ;  spitting blood .  Cycling tough but not as peak extreme
1	 @ marcuschown  @ KenBobPryde Sigh .  Could we hear about TdF today and leave out the Trotskyite tinfoil hat brigade ?  Cycling binds not divides us
1	 @ ProperEllipsis very sorry to hear about  mugging .  Technique seems same as happened 20 years ago to me in parks road !  SOP for E Oxford gang ? 
1	 @ DuncanStott someone can’t be right wing who wants “sunshine from cucumbers” .  Basis of right is empirical dismissal of barmy utopian schemes
1	 @ DuncanStott reason not to support is yet another barmy scheme by “progressive” utopians that would look like the euro’s drunken yob brother
1	Argument  @ DuncanStott  @ yablochko same as Luddites in C18th vs Arkwright’s spinning Jenny .  Fallacy of lump of labour 
1	 @ DuncanStott  @ yablochko guff like that  shows complete intellectual zombyism of left .  Blind assertion with a dusting of pixie tech dust deco
1	 @ DuncanStott  @ yablochko absolute pie - in - the - sky wibble .  Try constructing rational argument not mashing utopia with tech  & amp ;  declaring victory ! 
1	 @ Ox _ Bex  @ TonyOX3  @ oxchris  @ Gatineau1 Touché .  Tu es la reine Oxfordienne des snobs du pain gastronomique .  Chapeau ! 
1	 @ TonyOX3 no but there is one baker there that cuts the mustard when it comes to croissants
1	 @ Ox _ Bex  @ TonyOX3  @ oxchris  @ Gatineau1 that is completely understandable  -  you are completely forgiven !   ;  -  )  Even we food snobs are human …
1	Should also say  @ gatineau1 make the best croissants this side of Dijon  -  certainly nothing in the UK and large parts of France comes close
1	 @ TonyOX3  @ Ox _ Bex  @ oxchris no serious Frenchperson would ever buy bread in a “supermarché”  -  de Gaulle would turn in his grave  @ gatineau1
1	 @ TonyOX3  @ Ox _ Bex  @ oxchris the only good bread in Oxford is made by 
1	 @ TonyOX3  @ alumnioxford  @ DuncanStott Understand .  Always difficult to punish big - co or big - gov since public pays but they can’t be above law
1	Castle Milll  @ DuncanStott typical of prosaic lack of ambition in UK architecture  -  time to reintroduce beauty as planning aim  @ AlumniOxford
1	 @ TonyOX3  @ DuncanStott OCC is hoarding big cash reserves and has insurance .  Public wont be hit .  Time for new demolition policy  @ AlumniOxford
1	Agreed  @ DuncanStott but they should be beautiful ,  well - designed and not looming 3 storeys over Port Meadow ! 
1	I’m own a house  @ DuncanStott so no rent although bank has big slice for startup loan !  Paid for it from sale of hitech startup . 
1	Banks have and never will lend to startups  @ DuncanStott .  We risk our houses each time we start a new business .  Mansion tax needs rethink
1	Houses are main collateral for loans to startups  @ DuncanStott  -  we need to limit actual demand not engage in class war
1	Do abandon  @ DuncanStott your sanctimonious superiority .  Last flat we lived made family homeless under Shelter definitions  # prolierthanthou
1	Campaigners for concrete  @ duncanstott always talk supply never limiting demand .  Immigration of past decade and family breakup are left taboo
1	If Oxford conservationists  @ DuncanStott had not fought for decades then it would be as ugly as Swindon .  Progress does not mean concrete
1	Loggers in Amazon  & amp ;  Java  @ DuncanStott feel same about nimby natives .  Why not try to alter approach and understand not condemn opponents ? 
1	2 / 2 res pop .  Can’t build 300 , 000 houses so have to build in county towns .  Objective of left is swell Oxford to grow power of leftists
1	1 / 2 Facts on prices are clear  @ DuncanStott but there are many poss solutions like building in satellite towns .  Oxford has working pop 3x…
1	Those of us  @ DuncanStott want preserve beauty and environment know balance needed with development .  To you every issue black and white ? 
1	 @ ianhudspeth you forgot Chris Froome in yellow at TDF !  Much more important to we hippy cyclist types
1	 @ spokesmen best wishes on a speedy recovery  -  miss your commentary and hope what’s been a tough year gets lot better .  We do care about you
1	 @ Vaughters  @ delbified surely fair Moncoutié ,  clean super talented rider to point out the less scrupulous who destroyed career ?   # moralcourage
1	Good article on banks .  As a reformed ex - banker ,  the last para is bit strong but agree with much of the rest 
1	Like to see more hedgehogs again ?   @ mattwridley on natural balance ,  badgers and biodiversity 
1	 @ kickoutbnp Is your hate morally superior to the hate you claim to fight ?   -  I think its the fight you love not peace  @ BegsAli  @ tonybrett
1	 @ kickoutbnp Your attacks on Tony  & amp ;  other decent people  ( not EDL )  make me think you are as bigoted as those you oppose  @ BegsAli  @ tonybrett
1	 @ kickoutbnp understand your view but don’t agree demonising opponents works  -  you alienate reasonable people like us  @ BegsAli  @ tonybrett
1	 @ barnthebarn Could you DM me your email ? 
1	Excellent piece in  @ TheOxfordMail in support of  @ tonybrett  -  good to see paper standing for democracy and tolerance
1	Question  @ BegsAli  -  why don’t you oppose Marxists too  -  murdered many more than fascists and much more powerful and prevalent today ? 
1	I apologise  @ BegsAli .  Was answering  @ kickoutbnp .  he hasn’t aligned himself or supported EDL in any way
1	 @ kickoutbnp  @ BegsAli Whole point of the Niemoller quote is that totalitarians will pick on any group eventually ,  like you do .   @ tonybrett
1	 @ BegsAli  @ kickoutbnp Don’t think bullying me  ( yet )  but  @ tonybrett .  You seem to believe that anyone questions UAF is evil and you perfect
1	Hmmm  @ kickoutbnp  @ BegsAli 
1	No  @ kickoutbnp .  I agree the BNP is racist but  @ tonybrett is not .  He’s a good man and you are a bully
1	No  @ kickoutbnp I’m trying to defend the decent and honest man  @ tonybrett you are attacking and trying to destroy  -  I think you’re a bully
1	Or  @ kickoutbnp are you so perfect that anyone who disagrees with you is automatically evil ?  Sounds quite totalitarian to me .   @ tonybrett
1	 @ kickoutbnp Oh gosh ,  then you are wrong .   @ tonybrett does not stand with the EDL ,  just disagrees with you  -  can’t you spot the difference ? 
1	What  @ kickoutbnp  @ tonybrett is a very good councillor .  Lib Dem  ( unlike me )  how on earth can you call him a hatemonger ?  Do need to calm down
1	 @ spineynorman78  @ BegsAli Ad Hominem attacks on those with different opinions are roots of totalitarian behaviour  -  be nice .   @ tonybrett
1	 @ spineynorman78  @ BegsAli Very dangerous to assume that only you are right  /  virtuous  -  I’m often wrong and change my mind .   @ tonybrett
1	 @ spineynorman78  @ BegAli I called  @ tonybrett a hero not him !  If you believe in tolerance  & amp ;  free speech then argue your point not attack
1	 @ tonybrett done
1	Too often  @ tonybrett only the fanatics organise  -  thoughtful voice isn’t heard  -  they are tribal  & amp ;  we’re too quiet in response
1	We need to give you broader support  @ tonybrett  -  been thinking for some time that Oxford needs campaign for freedom speech  & amp ;  real liberalism
1	You’re a hero  @ tonybrett .  The aggression  & amp ;  intolerance of those who claim to stand for peace  & amp ;  tolerance ,  needs to be questioned  & amp ;  changed
1	Impressed  @ tonybrett superb piece  -  well done !  Small acts of moral courage like yours are what makes a healthy community tick . 
1	Truth is complex  @ michele _ paule unions are / were often against meritocracy .  Print unions were ,  teaching unions can be now in my opinion
