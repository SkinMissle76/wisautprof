3	 @ DrEdWild Cripes are you complaining again ?   @ domcavlan will start online - bullying you too if not careful . Caution :  
3	‚ÄòMental health trusts delivering better value‚Äô :   @ NHSEngland responds to evidence of falling budgets 
3	 @ Danielf90 Indeed .  A failure of your trust  ( and their commissioners )  to appreciate the huge mental health morbidity in their hospital
3	 @ domcavlan  @ mikeyrayment phew .  that means i dont have to have to source a border terrier as well as a spaniel .

3	 @ AliceLomax  @ beaconuk  @ PaulBurstow Id guess it would be as bad in physical health setting where I often see lack of discharge planning ? 
3	Too often experienced drug / alcohol nurses in ED replaced by  ( cheaper )  workers who cant offer staff / pts adequate support  @ guardian

3	Interesting evening with  @ victoriajhume at  @ ExploreWellcome for preview of Foreign Bodies exhibition 
3	Disappointing lack of  # mental health in Phase 1 of  # Keogh Review of Emergency Care .  Vital in  " supporting self care "  and need crisis pathways
3	 @ Danielf90  @ NHSE _ Dean .  .  .  not a skeleton service .  Absolutely doctors ,  but other teams too ,  sure . 
3	 @ WesselyS If wasnt so depressing it would be comic .  Meanwhile ,  was pleased to see you on ballot paper yesterday .  .  .  good luck !   # castmyvote

3	 @ DrEdWild No backup required thanks .  Though if I can find an AMHP then we can detain  @ domcavlan for the protection of others . 
3	 @ mattyheron wheres Liaison œà  ?   * storms off sobbing * 
3	IF ONLY FOR A SECOND  /  /  Mimi Foundation  /  /  UK :  
3	 @ Danielf90 Some hospitals more than others .  And what nonsense that it should be about buzzwords rather than need ,  but too often true . 
3	The  # MedicalCouncilonAlcohol has some great resources and competitions for students and trainees  # RCPsychDebate 
3	As deterrent ¬£10 doesnt seem much  ( barely packet of fags )  .  Fear might seem quite good value and perversely justify non - emergency use .   # NHS
3	 .  @ BBCr4today What actually is squally rain ?  There seems to be a lot of it about today . 
3	Antidepressant use on the rise in rich countries ,  OECD finds 
3	 @ AlexBThomson I note a subtle change in your LinkedIn profile  -  does this augur good news ?  Bravo if so !  Who else ?  Now ,  about that merger .  .  .

3	Enjoyed meeting  @ RoehamptonUni therapy students today to teach about psychiatric model and debate pros and cons of labelling and meds  # DSM5
3	 @ guytnoble  @ victoriajhume They did .  Fantastic stuff .  And a great and important left field at an academic conference ! 
3	Bit disappointed by  @ BBCFileon4  -  failed to highlight the massive harms of crystal methamphetamine in some UK subpopulations eg MSM  /  HIV

3	 @ Tim _ JR _ Hill A vivid metaphor !

3	RT :   @ myersjoel :  So Ive been busy all day .  2 thoughts :  1 )  No Shit Sherlock .  2 )  what a little star . 
3	 @ soukici  @ mattyheron  @ JonBradfield my 3 year old godson thought it was the best thing EVER . 
3	 @ Danielf90 Thats because the local commissioners and hospital didnt purchase a proper Liaison service .  Its coming soon though . 
3	 @ domcavlan  @ mikeyrayment glad you could be there for him in his hour of need .  .  .  
3	 .  @ annacfryer fantastic to be at a conference where the programme includes both a National Clinical Director  @ DrG _ NHS and a Core Trainee ! 
3	 @ DrGrumble More than one per hospital ?   # overkill
3	Both  @ RCPsychs Sue Bailey ,  and Broadway /  @ Disney / MurderSheWrotes Angela Lansbury Damed in the NY Honours .   # Bravi 
3	 @ Danielf90  @ silv24  @ thomjcarter  @ ncl _ medic The whole point of 7 day working is to have the AHP depts operating .  More important than docs

3	August Osage County Official Trailer 
3	Proposal  -  why dont we instead inform pts the actual cost to  # NHS of attendances  ( staff ,  tests / scans ,  transport  & amp ; c )  on discharge summary ? 
3	Apparently I value :  assertiveness ,  coping with uncertainty ,  out of hours work ,  educating pts ,  teams ,  ability cope with imprecision  =  my job !

3	 @ LAHFArtsHealth :   @ bsosinowicz  @ victoriajhume  @ guytnoble Sorry to miss you all  -  was caught up at work . 
3	Thanks Sarah Hilton for the crockery  -  think you have  @ mikeyrayment down to a T !  
3	Excellent  @ guardian article about the good work of  @ TurningPointUKs peer mentors .  Gold standard ,  however ,  would be qualified nursing staff . 
3	Extremely unhelpful / misleading of  @ BBCr4today  @ BBCBreaking to repeat incorrect statements re :  antidepressant addiction  ( ‚â† tranquillisers ) 
3	Finally ,   @ BBCFileon4 ,  not accurate description of physical / psychological harms of meth from your speaker  -  more than just ageing and candy ! 
3	 @ Danielf90 Strangely though ,  often it does .  In psychiatry ,  for instance . 
3	 @ mattyheron i do lots of work in ICU  -  delirium rife and many pts not unconscious .  .  . 
3	 @ zebsoanes You foraged cinnamon ?  Bravo sir !
