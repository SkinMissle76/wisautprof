-0.46	My set from a wet and windy game at Peacehaven 
-0.46	I will eventually get to where I want to be .  This Im certain of
-0.46	I couldnt care less .  I love what I do and if I carry on approaching each game in the same way I have done for the past 20 months
-0.46	the honest and in my view ,  right way to approach it .  Not being money or business orientated has cost me so much money ,  but frankly
-0.46	My love for covering every aspect of the game and club while maintaining that good relationship needed with the fans
-0.46	for the money and could not care less about the teams ,  players ,  fans or the club itself .  This is where my biggest strength comes in
-0.46	After covering the game for almost 2 years ,  I feel I do put alot of club photographers to shame .  Ive found most of them do it just
-0.46	Weather it may be a Champions League game ,  Premier League ,  Ryman League ,  Youth game or a Womens game .  My dedication and work rate remains
-0.46	In a very positive mood about my photography at the moment .  The dedication ,  passion and hard work I put into it is second to none
-0.46	Looking through my games list ,  Im only 4 away from covering as many as I did last season  ( 96 )  and 8 away from 100 games this season
-0.46	Watching the ITV FA Cup highlights just show how unprofessional and joke like it it compared to Sky ,  christ ,  even compared to BBC !
