2	 @ Derenibrahim My favourite shot of you from the game .  Despite the score and conditions ,  still playing with a smile  
2	3 - 0 down ,  cold ,  wet and a long journey back .  Yet still plays with a smile on his face  # football‚Ä¶ 
2	Not a wag ,  Bentley ,  sponsorship deal ,  fitness coach or ¬£200K anywhere to be seen .  Straight up‚Ä¶ 
2	Stand together ,  fall together  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # ryman  # south  # peacehaven  # leatherhead‚Ä¶ 
2	A bit muddy perhaps  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # ryman  # south  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # surrey‚Ä¶

2	My set from  @ PT _ FCs 3 - 0 victory over  @ leatherheadfc  @ rymanleaguenews  @ NonLeaguePaper 
2	My set from a wet and windy game at Peacehaven 
2	I will eventually get to where I want to be .  This Im certain of
2	I couldnt care less .  I love what I do and if I carry on approaching each game in the same way I have done for the past 20 months
2	the honest and in my view ,  right way to approach it .  Not being money or business orientated has cost me so much money ,  but frankly
2	My love for covering every aspect of the game and club while maintaining that good relationship needed with the fans
2	for the money and could not care less about the teams ,  players ,  fans or the club itself .  This is where my biggest strength comes in
2	After covering the game for almost 2 years ,  I feel I do put alot of club photographers to shame .  Ive found most of them do it just
2	Weather it may be a Champions League game ,  Premier League ,  Ryman League ,  Youth game or a Womens game .  My dedication and work rate remains
2	In a very positive mood about my photography at the moment .  The dedication ,  passion and hard work I put into it is second to none
2	Looking through my games list ,  Im only 4 away from covering as many as I did last season  ( 96 )  and 8 away from 100 games this season
2	Watching the ITV FA Cup highlights just show how unprofessional and joke like it it compared to Sky ,  christ ,  even compared to BBC ! 
2	 @ BryonyWharfe ata girl  ;  ) 
2	 @ BryonyWharfe Im sure you can involve chocolate in it one way or another  : P
2	 @ BryonyWharfe could there be anything better ? 
2	 @ BryonyWharfe its win win ! 
2	 @ BryonyWharfe turn it into a reality programme ,  make some dollah  ;  ) 
2	No prizes for guessing who was the busiest of the two  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven‚Ä¶ 
2	 @ SamElliott _ NLP You treat me well with these great pics  ;  ) 
2	The love of the game in its simplest form of just playing with your best mates  # football  # soccer‚Ä¶ 
2	Cant beat a goalmouth scramble  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # scramble‚Ä¶ 
2	Lovely little chip  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # rain  # surrey  # sussex  # goal‚Ä¶ 
2	An early goal to set the bar  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # ryman  # goal‚Ä¶ 
2	Todays game ,  one of only a few Non League to survive the weather ,  Peacehaven v Leatherhead  # football‚Ä¶ 
2	Another Youth player to keep an eye out for  .  Brighton schoolboy ,  now at Crawley playing in the U18‚Ä¶
