40	 @ Derenibrahim My favourite shot of you from the game .  Despite the score and conditions ,  still playing with a smile  
40	3 - 0 down ,  cold ,  wet and a long journey back .  Yet still plays with a smile on his face  # football‚Ä¶ 
40	Not a wag ,  Bentley ,  sponsorship deal ,  fitness coach or ¬£200K anywhere to be seen .  Straight up‚Ä¶ 
40	Stand together ,  fall together  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # ryman  # south  # peacehaven  # leatherhead‚Ä¶ 
40	A bit muddy perhaps  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # ryman  # south  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # surrey‚Ä¶ 
40	Get it out !   # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # mud  # winter  # rain  # ryman  # south‚Ä¶ 
40	My set from  @ PT _ FCs 3 - 0 victory over  @ leatherheadfc  @ rymanleaguenews  @ NonLeaguePaper 
40	My set from a wet and windy game at Peacehaven 
40	I will eventually get to where I want to be .  This Im certain of
40	I couldnt care less .  I love what I do and if I carry on approaching each game in the same way I have done for the past 20 months
40	the honest and in my view ,  right way to approach it .  Not being money or business orientated has cost me so much money ,  but frankly
40	My love for covering every aspect of the game and club while maintaining that good relationship needed with the fans
40	for the money and could not care less about the teams ,  players ,  fans or the club itself .  This is where my biggest strength comes in
40	After covering the game for almost 2 years ,  I feel I do put alot of club photographers to shame .  Ive found most of them do it just
40	Weather it may be a Champions League game ,  Premier League ,  Ryman League ,  Youth game or a Womens game .  My dedication and work rate remains
40	In a very positive mood about my photography at the moment .  The dedication ,  passion and hard work I put into it is second to none
40	Looking through my games list ,  Im only 4 away from covering as many as I did last season  ( 96 )  and 8 away from 100 games this season
40	Watching the ITV FA Cup highlights just show how unprofessional and joke like it it compared to Sky ,  christ ,  even compared to BBC ! 
40	 @ BryonyWharfe ata girl  ;  ) 
40	 @ BryonyWharfe Im sure you can involve chocolate in it one way or another  : P
40	 @ BryonyWharfe could there be anything better ? 
40	 @ BryonyWharfe its win win ! 
40	 @ BryonyWharfe turn it into a reality programme ,  make some dollah  ;  ) 
40	No prizes for guessing who was the busiest of the two  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven‚Ä¶ 
40	 @ SamElliott _ NLP You treat me well with these great pics  ;  ) 
40	The love of the game in its simplest form of just playing with your best mates  # football  # soccer‚Ä¶ 
40	Cant beat a goalmouth scramble  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # scramble‚Ä¶ 
40	Lovely little chip  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # rain  # surrey  # sussex  # goal‚Ä¶ 
40	An early goal to set the bar  # football  # soccer  # nonleague  # peacehaven  # leatherhead  # ryman  # goal‚Ä¶ 
40	Todays game ,  one of only a few Non League to survive the weather ,  Peacehaven v Leatherhead  # football‚Ä¶ 
40	Another Youth player to keep an eye out for  .  Brighton schoolboy ,  now at Crawley playing in the U18‚Ä¶
