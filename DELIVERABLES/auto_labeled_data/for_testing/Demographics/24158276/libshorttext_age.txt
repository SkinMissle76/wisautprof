-0.24	 @ jonfildes  @ BBC _ Future Im hoping for a future where BBC considers UK to be part of the world and can therefore view BBC worldwide stuff !

-0.24	 @ suziperry  @ ideal _ home _ show The dress doesnt seem to match the scenery !   :  ) 
-0.24	Dear Twitter users .  Having a prize for the xth follower just means no - one will follow you until you get to x - 1 ,  which youll never reach .  .

-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary Precaution if Kimi cant be bothered to turn up for a race  ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ weareworship Also your Mission Worship downloads page only has one song on it .  Shouldnt there be 16 ?

-0.24	 @ LeeMcKenzieF1 Im already looking forward to  @ therealdcf1s next instalment of Vettel  & amp ;  McKenzie rumours  ;  )

-0.24	 @ tfaiso I tried it at  " Original "  .  My poor old Windows laptop laughed at me and just gave me stuttery playback !  Looked great at 1080p tho  :  )

-0.24	Dear  @ apress ,  Im afraid your  $ 12 ebooks offer doesnt quite match up to  @ packtpub  $ 5 offering ! 
-0.24	8 yr olds  @ clarksshoes worn out before he outgrew them .  Seems no point paying extra for Clarks then ,  will go to  @ Sainsburys for next pair

-0.24	 @ WilliamsF1Team Aww ,  no PC version  :  (  Could you give me an XBox or PS3 to go with it should I win ?   ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ danshapiro Thanks ,  honest is good  :  ) 
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary £19 . 98 is the  / sale /  price of a t - shirt ?  !  Does it light up if they win or something ? 
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary Its not for the trophies or the prize money ,  RBRs motivation is the AutoSport awards !  SV really wants to be a standup comic
-0.24	 @ dnaltews  @ inetpro Remember .  Youre the product ,  the advertiser is the customer . 
-0.24	 @ tfaiso I would choose the Nexus 5 ,  but I didnt see one in the photo !   ;  )

-0.24	 @ MSE _ GuyAnker  @ MoneySavingExp From Jan ?  So does this mean all the firms are likely to increase their prices in Dec to pre - empt it ? 
-0.24	 @ McGuireDavid Of course it can sometimes lead to finding 50 forums with the question ,  and none of them with a useful reply ! 
-0.24	 @ robwalling  @ danshapiro Your copy ?  Even if secretly it is for you ,  arent we meant to be pretending its for the kids ?   ;  )

-0.24	 @ JennieGow  @ BBC5LiveF1 Christian Horners foot ? 
-0.24	Strange noise coming from building next door .  Sounds like one of Amazons drones has got trapped and is struggling to find an exit .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ inetpro  @ dnaltews 190million unique twitter users each month .  Even if 10 %  marked adverts as spam ,  still 170 million left .  Hardly a dent  :  ( 
-0.24	 @ violetposy An iPod / iPhone is the obvious answer .  Then you wont have the same problem next year  ;  -  ) 
-0.24	Well I guess it is official ,   @ dungerman has declared me  @ ccmh s  " boffin "  .  .  .

-0.24	 @ Canonjjohn Also blackmail aspect ?  Give me a treat or Ill do harm .  .  .  not a particularly good example for kids
-0.24	 @ McGuireDavid I often use questions ,  accuracy of results is often improved  ( since someone else has likely posted same question somewhere ) 
-0.24	 @ MSE _ GuyAnker  @ MoneySavingExp To clarify ,  I mean increase prices for those of us mid - contract  ( rather than new contracts ) 
-0.24	 @ timebenezer I said in the  ( very brief )  interview it was  " about 10 years old "  .  .  .  lucky guess !   :  ) 
-0.24	 @ weareworship I wanted to mention that you really need an  " Other "  in your signup Denomination list !  Were a Local Ecumenical Project church . 
-0.24	 @ virginmedia Seriously ?  If you hold your passwords in plain text anywhere it is not secure ,  no matter what .  Glad Im not a Virgin customer ! 
-0.24	 @ codinghorror I think you need to come down to the real world at some point .  Not everyone has spare cash to throw at latest tech ! 
-0.24	 @ McGuireDavid Indeed .  They should be using tracking cookies then theyd know exactly which you want to watch .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ ArgosHelpers I really do hope you have a project going on to drag your 19th century systems into the 21st century ! 
-0.24	 @ BTCare £900mil for a few games of football ?  I was hoping the increase in line rental etc would be going towards infrastructure  * sigh *

-0.24	 @ thechurchmouse Who copied who ? 
-0.24	 @ NobleF1 Is there / will there be a video of his speech online ? 
-0.24	 @ oneplusi Perhaps you should choose the sportscar with the most photogenic seat fabric .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ BTCare You appear to be talking to yourself ,  but good attempt at pretending  @ BTSport and  @ BTCare are different accounts  ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ timebenezer Are you sure it isnt a problem your end ?   :  ) 
-0.24	 @ GeorgeTakei Before deciding to resurrect Professor X ,  Sir Patrick was asked to audition as Lobsterine in the next X - Men film
-0.24	 @ McGuireDavid  * reads the Aung San Suu Kyi Wikipedia page *  Cant see anything about copywriting or marathon running .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ ruskin147 Perhaps you could search for facebook beheading videos on the Surface and kill two birds with one ,  erm ,  guillotine
-0.24	 @ andrewbensonf1 I suspect Bernie could do RBR a few favours to get him out of the contract though !   ( Not that they need any atm ) 
-0.24	 @ Jamesallenonf1 I know it wont be fair whoever does it ,  but surely bottom 3 teams would be better than top ?  Close gap ,  not make it bigger ! 
-0.24	 @ violetposy Plus tiny garden ,  enough parking for one small car and who needs space for wardrobes anyway ? 
-0.24	 @ dave1010 Well RAM is cheap ,  and anyway everyone knows Google isnt evil .  .   * cough *   ;  )

-0.24	 @ tfaiso Im going to deliberately watch it at 320x240 out of pure envy  ;  -  ) 
-0.24	 @ timebenezer itll just often connect to BTWifi  ( which then requires a browser login )  rather than my personal BT WiFi  * sigh * 
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary Perhaps they were able to borrow a turbo F1 car from the 80s  ;  ) 
-0.24	 " reduce CO2 emissions by 18 . 4 %  per employee "   /  /  Did  @ McLarenF1 take baked beans off the menu ?   ;  )  
-0.24	 @ cyclinglawman  @ buryfree Yeah ,  I find it odd .  Im guessing a few councillors are very friendly with a CEO of a bridge building company .  . 
-0.24	 @ weareworship Your website feedback option doesnt appear to be working
-0.24	 @ andrewbensonf1 Perhaps they ought to also have a speed limit of 70mph ,  and keep to the left unless overtaking ? 
-0.24	 @ LouFellingham Fantastic Worship tonight at  @ MissionWorship ,  Thank you  :  -  ) 
-0.24	 @ McLarenF1 Those simulated tyres must be much better than the real ones to be able to 6 . 5million laps  ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ worshipcentral  # missionworship Drummer was great .  Shame about the sound engineer who set volume of the kick drum .  Made us ill .   :  -  ( 
-0.24	 @ inetpro Accept that a service such as twitter needs income ,  and advertising is currently the most viable solution
-0.24	 @ davelee So why do new gadgets get prominent BBC news coverage ,  where new cars  ( for example )  get relegated to Top Gear ? 
-0.24	 @ adds68 1080p is so yesterday .   @ tfaiso will now have to wait for the 2160p PS5 so it looks good on his new TV  ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ mattfarina You should use Windows ,  the upgrade to 8 . 1 went smoothly for everyo .  .  .  oh wait .   ;  )

-0.24	Looking forward to  @ MartinSmithTV at  @ MissionWorship .  Hope the kick drum volume isnt quite so loud as  @ timhughes77 s that made us ill  :  -  ( 
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary Sky Sources ,  who have just read the BBC website ,  understand that .  .  . 
-0.24	Really  @ Argos _ Online  ,  too high volume website errors 3 weeks before Christmas ?  Why not just handover your store keys to  @ AmazonUK too ? 
-0.24	 @ danshapiro On a scale of 1 - 10  ( where 1 = no chance ,  and 10 = Amazon drones on route now )  how confident are you of UK delivery by Christmas ? 
-0.24	 @ davewalker  @ missnfranchised Or the Churchwarden pigeon hole
-0.24	Dear Quantum Motorsports ,  please give Lotus your money so they can sign a driver rather than a wallet

-0.24	 @ martinsaunders Reminds me of this 
-0.24	 @ stedsbc Not so short on the way back though carrying lots of heavy shopping bags with kids screaming at your heels !   :  ) 
-0.24	 @ inetpro Ahh ,  I misunderstood  :  ) 
-0.24	 @ JensonButton Just cut a few corners .  You might want to paint the car red and steal a Spaniards helmet first though to get away with it  ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary Hes getting married ? 
-0.24	 @ McGuireDavid  :  -  )   ( oh and apologies for the dodgy apostrophe  * embarrassed *  ) 
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary So  @ LewisHamilton can cope with two girls singing in the back ,  but not if his race engineer tells him his tyres are hot ?   ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ ProfBrianCox Umm why deny it ?  Who is it hurting ?  Would the world be a better place with inaccurate GPS or something ? 
-0.24	 @ tfaiso Ill take your word for it ,  Ive never married a blow up doll so cant compare  :  ) 
-0.24	 @ shipoffoolscom

-0.24	 @ McLarenF1  # AskKevin If McLaren have best car  & amp ;  if it turns out you are faster than  @ JensonButton ,  could you let him win the British GP ?   ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ shipoffoolscom Surprised you havent commented on the major news story of today .  Some churches are daring to use projectors ,  not hymnbooks ! 
-0.24	 @ davewalker  @ missnfranchised For some reason they mysteriously find their way to the PA / Projection desk in our church
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary Ouch .  Thats gotta hurt
-0.24	 @ guardian  @ tjathurman Nothing like a bit of atheist infighting .  Perhaps they ought to consider splitting into different denominations .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ ScarbsF1 Perhaps they are trying to attempt to lap the rest of the field before the season ends ! 
-0.24	 @ curryspcworld Aww ,  I just recently cleared out all my old  /  broken tech ! 
-0.24	 @ tfaiso I always suggest folk buy a device for what it has ,  not what it may or may not have in future ,  regardless of promises .

-0.24	 @ Christianitymag Although I only watched 15 minutes in the middle ,  so not really a fair review  ;  ) 
-0.24	Someone needs to start selling large butterfly nets on Amazon ,  calling them drone catchers
-0.24	 @ tfaiso So no need to buy a new Mac Pro now then ?   ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ MBrundleF1 If Grosjean can get from 17th to 3rd ,  Im sure Vettel could be sent to the back of the grid and still win !   ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ martinsaunders Ouch !  Im quite impressed at how Peter managed to more or less stay on key ! 
-0.24	 @ BBCWatchdog Supermarkets are right .  Back when I first started with microwave meals I got the  " serves 2 "  for just me .  Serves 1 is OK now . 
-0.24	 @ charlie _ whiting Perhaps if the investors hurried up and gave  @ Lotus _ F1Team their big cheque ,  Pastor could then rip his up and drive gokarts
-0.24	 @ McLarenF1 After 8 years  @ HiltonHHonors really ought to fix the HH typo
-0.24	 @ davelee Nah ,  someone will have stolen it already  ;  )

-0.24	 @ andrewbensonf1 Meanwhile the English cricket team are in desperate need of rain .  Perhaps if everyone blows at the same time .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ violetposy Bargain !  Imagine what the price would have been if theyd included windows .  .  . 
-0.24	 @ TimCAD Congratulations !  Take some paternity leave ,  That cute little chap is definitely more important than us lot  :  -  ) 
-0.24	 @ violetposy Ahh .  Well perhaps one of those bits of paper with the picture of the Queen and a number in the corner .  Teens like those too  ;  -  ) 
-0.24	Better to have one prize for a random existing follower  ( to stop unfollow - then - follow )  ,  and another prize for random new between now and xth
-0.24	 @ suziperry I could say something like  " Quicker than a Williams crew then "  ,  but that wouldnt be nice would it ?   :  ) 
-0.24	 @ davewalker It did start out in the kitchen .  But the lunch club needed space for the 15 pans they need ,  just in case 14 of them break
-0.24	 @ GrandPrixDiary We should be OK as long as Newey doesnt design his football boots .  .   ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ McGuireDavid  # giraffe I thought eyes ,  or window to tell them to get lost .  .  .   :  -  ) 
-0.24	 @ bobbyllew Well they do have the rights to F1 .  Perhaps they are scared of competition ,  since the tyres might actually go the distance in FE
-0.24	 @ tjathurman I think there is an app called Twitter which allows you to do that  ;  ) 
-0.24	 @ petejamesmusic The worship was amazing tonight  :  -  )

-0.24	 @ tswyatt  @ churchtimes It had the special privilege of being stapled inside the back cover of our Mission England Praise songbooks  :  ) 
-0.24	 @ davewalker Ive not heard the germ - spreading argument about books !  Is this why those on laptop rota get ill together ?  Germs on keyboard  ;  )
