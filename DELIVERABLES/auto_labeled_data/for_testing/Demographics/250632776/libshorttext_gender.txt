-1	My mobiles been charging all day and its only on 14 %  .  Need a better charging cable for work ! 
-1	 @ lukewhitt _   @ bendemes All I got from reading that is design / colour changes and Android already does that !  Theyve lost their innovation . 
-1	That continues the trend of Android for dev and Apple for testers and management . 
-1	 @ BigSpud Cool !  How was the event ? 
-1	If it doesnt work Ill be getting up early to fix it .  .  . 
-1	 @ BigSpud Theres obviously a few annoying days ,  but on the whole Im very much enjoying it .   :  -  )

-1	 @ Simmopocalypse  # jealous
-1	 @ BigSpud  @ bendemes  @ lukewhitt _   @ craig _ pilgrim Yeah ,  Ive read a lot of his blogs .  It could be interesting ! 
-1	That way ,  when it crashes and you have to reopen it ,  you dont have to set everything back up again ! 
-1	 @ sjdeighton Thats what PP said ! 
-1	First pointless fact of 2013 :  This is the first year since I was born where all digits of the year are different . 
-1	 @ LightSpeedIT Theres good reasons for making lines of code short ,  but who codes in terminal windows ? 
-1	So .  .  .  Back to work tomorrow . 
-1	Ate out every day over Christmas and didnt pay a penny . 
-1	My bros passed his probation and is now a full time games dev !

-1	So earlier today the development and testing teams were given nice and warm  @ OandMSystems fleeces .   :  ) 
-1	Why does everything happen on the same day ?  Ive now got three possible plans for Thursday ! 
-1	 @ BigSpud  @ RandomAHC Links giving me a horrible 404 .  Think they need to hire a website developer ! 
-1	Got email invite to the new Google Maps ,  opened it in Chrome on my Google phone and apparently my browser is not supported .  Come on Google ! 
-1	 @ cgpgrey Dont know whether youre looking for these ,  but theres a few spelling mistakes / typos near the end . 
-1	 @ virginmedia Yes .  It worked on the second attempt .  I was surprised by it crashing !  Hopefully it was a random glitch ! 
-1	 @ richardacre Amazing engineering and coding .  Especially with Curiosity landing itself !

-1	 @ BigSpud  @ bendemes  @ lukewhitt _   @ craig _ pilgrim An advantage for you London guys .  I wont be able to comfortably make it by half six . 
-1	 @ sjdeighton lol A couple of tweets before ,  my mates are complaining about the train being packed at Chelmsford ! 
-1	The office is far too busy and distracting today .  Earphones in .  Music on . 
-1	So its National  # BloodWeek .  I keep thinking about giving blood .   Need to actually do that one day .  .  . 
-1	 @ bendemes I had the where clause wrong and reset ALL 114000 requests !  I kind of recovered by updating them to be a success ,  but without date
-1	Windows XP and Visual Studio  . NET 2003 .   # legacy
-1	 @ thedecibelkid  @ googlemaps It does that .  When I go somewhere regularly Google Now shows a card when I should leave with the traffic info . 
-1	 @ smartereveryday A good looking wooden floor .   :  ) 
-1	It turns out its not Thursday today .  I really thought it was ! 
-1	 @ sjdeighton Just remembered Ive taken your place in the O & amp ; M pool league today .  I hope youve left me in a good position !   ;  ) 
-1	Damn that leap year 5 years ago causing a bug in my code ! 
-1	Got new blood on the dev team today .  First question we asked him :  Android or Apple ? 
-1	 @ thedecibelkid Looks busy .   :  -  ) 
-1	I think the text network has collapsed !   :  -  ( 
-1	 @ SimmoIsAPyro Some of O & amp ; M trying to get out ! 
-1	 @ BigSpud Sounds like I should have popped in .  I enjoyed writing that system .  I imagine there are lots of systems doing a similar thing . 
-1	I really need a nice long relaxing holiday ! 
-1	Accidentally shutdown a PC over remote desktop instead of rebooting it after windows update .   # idiot
-1	I now have Android 4 . 2 . 2 ! 
-1	I love it when some people start their arrays at 1 rather than 0 .  Makes things really easy .   :  / 
-1	Any guesses as to how many bugs were introduced in last nights processing ? 
-1	 @ bendemes There was a login permissions error so I fixed it and wanted to reset the two failed requests .  .  . 
-1	So annoying when making a small mistake while playing a card game and then going on to losing . 
-1	 @ SimpossibleD Good idea .  I need something to stop me getting distracted today ! 
-1	Another reason why I dont run anti - virus software !   & gt ; Thousands of PCs internet access cut 
-1	Been working here for a year and a half and thats the first time Ive had to refill the printer ! 
-1	I dont know what Android 4 . 2 . 2 brings ,  but I want it ! 
-1	Ooh ,  BBCs repeating the last episode of  # Sherlock season 2 .  Thats got to be one of the best plot twists Ive seen for a while ! 
-1	Its so annoying getting a bug simply saying that something doesnt work as expected . 
-1	 @ sjdeighton Nooooo .  I think he knows anyway . 
-1	1 . 21 GIGAWATS !  !  ! 
-1	 @ sjdeighton We had that the other day .   :  (

-1	It seems my PC cant cope with running three virtual machines at once .  Who would have thought ?  ! 
-1	Ubuntu 12 . 10 looks very nice .  This is going to be my next OS .   # GoodbyeWindows
-1	Argh !  I starting to hate Telerik .  All Im trying to do is make some HTML text bold ! 
-1	 @ bendemes Didnt realise win 8 has antivirus now though ! 
-1	After about an hour of debugging someone elses code I can confirm  .  .  .  it is broken .  No idea why though .   # ComplexCodeForNoReason
-1	 @ BigSpud Ive typed that so many times lately !  The program Im developing atm needs a login every time its run !  I keep mistyping my name  :  ( 
-1	Just found that the  @ O2 app has been updated .  Theyve done a good job redesigning it .  Quite impressed . 
-1	 @ richardacre The description doesnt sell it too well !  I dont think youll get many bids .  .  . 
-1	Making full use of technology with my brother and sister with a shared YouTube music playlist on our smart TV .   # win
-1	 @ craig _ pilgrim Ooh ,  I might get that .  I quite liked those two books . 
-1	This is quite clever !  Youll eventually get a stack overflow though .   :  (   # xkcd 
-1	Going to make the rest of the office ill .   :  -  / 
-1	My mouse has done that thing again where I can scroll all the up or all the way down ,  but not in between .   :  -  / 
-1	 @ sjdeighton  @ outseyuk Visual Studio wouldnt open the solution .   :  -  /  Im waiting for the computer to restart .  .  . 
-1	 @ bendemes Missed your tweet !  Im still keeping on 7 with Security Essentials .  I like to think I know what Im doing online ! 
-1	Whose Line is it Anyway is apparently returning next month ! The original Mock the Week ,  but much funnier . 
-1	 @ sjdeighton  @ outseyuk I assume you two are working hard then ?   : P
-1	 @ BigSpud Havent done that for a while ,  but I always enjoyed it .   :  -  ) 
-1	Just been told Britains Got Talent was won by an Hungarian group .  What ?  !
