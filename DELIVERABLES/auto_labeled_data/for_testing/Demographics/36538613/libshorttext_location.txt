42	 @ LAPedro went digging at amoeba a while back and found some cool tunes .  Dont have listening stations though . 
42	 @ LAPedro Havent gone shopping for new vinyl in years .  Black pancake would be my guess for the new stuff .  Amoeba is dope too ,  new and used . 
42	 @ LAPedro i use the output limiter too ,  it keeps everything level .  Not sure about the s4 ,  thrs no audio going through it so that might be it
42	 @ LAPedro I dont use the internal mixer so I cant speak for its accuracy .  I use the autogain function and also keep the master out of red
42	 @ LAPedro using internal mixer ?
