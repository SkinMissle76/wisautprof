-1	My festive looking PC !   # christmas 
-1	 @ OMyKumquats  @ GroovesharkHelp only just seen this sorry !  Interesting ,  currently using auto shutdown after handover .  This may work better .  .  . 
-1	Come join my broadcast ,   " Pop N Rock Mix "   # nowplaying  # tunesday 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp what does the special guest do in a broadcast ?  What controls does the guest get ? 
-1	Come join my broadcast ,   " Alternative / Pop / Rock / Indie Throwup "   # nowplaying 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp No problem and thank YOU for creating the brilliant broadcast platform !   @ Grooveshark truly is my home for music !  Shark out . 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp Ah I guess that means ill have to find a trusted person then !  Thanks for the help and sorry for such a complicated problem ! 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp ah .  .  .  Could I set up a user on my home PC ,  as my home PC can stay on all day .  Then when I leave work pass it to that user ? 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp That could solve the problem perfectly ,  would it be ok to set up a second account to bridge that gap ?  No break of ToS ? 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp I have to shut down my pc after work ,  so no way to pass the broadcast to my home pc as i leave work .  Probably no solution ! 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp thanks for the reply doing that sort of thing already .  No alternative to keep me out of trouble at work ?   : P thanks anyway ! 
-1	 @ GroovesharkHelp Love the broadcast feature ,  but currently I have to turn my broadcast off whilst going home from work .  Any way around this ? 
-1	Finally !  Ive waiting too damn long for this .  .  .   # pokemonxy 
-1	 @ AimeeDorris errrr can do ?  Im there for a football match but yeh .  .  . 
-1	 @ xxleannaxx3 thanks for the follow !  Out of interest is the picture in your heading of NYC ?  Fantastic photo ! 
-1	 @ ATVI _ Acas think thats what Ill do .  Thanks for the replies and see you online ! 
-1	 @ ATVI _ Acas last gasp attempt before I unquestionably accept my free goods .  Hardened edition PC  +  physical prestige goods  =  PC prestige ? 
-1	 @ ATVI _ Acas Ah ok that makes sense then .  No chance of a sneaky swap to whatever PC version is available ?   : P .  Cheers for the reply . 
-1	 @ ATVI _ Acas Any reason the prestige edition from eurogamer couldnt be on PC ?  Bit disappointed ,  appreciate the giveaway anyway !   # CODGhosts
-1	 @ CosmicDanzo Haha nah not a problem .  Going with a radical redesign or sticking with the masterpiece of the current design ? 
-1	Goddamit  @ CosmicDanzo making me think I was further behind on the GPGNC than i thought !   : P Tables were posted page 54 of the thread . 
-1	A little disappointed the steeler lost but fantastic game and an amazing experience .  Bring on next year !   # NFLUK  # Steelers
-1	Played some Ghosts today ,  the game actually looks and feels really good .  I felt much more realistic and everything flowed quite nicely . 
-1	Absolute chaos ,  sprinting ,  shoving and people getting crushed .  But Ive got it !   # eurogamer  # cod 
-1	Its hot ,  its crowded and we are stuck in a basement .  Hundreds crammed just to get Ghost  # eurogamer  # cod 
-1	7 oclock and already been here for 2 hours .  At least its light enough to see where I am now .  .  .   # EGX
-1	Anyone else thing offsides in the FIFA 14 demos are far too sensitive .  Can be in - line / millimeters offside and the game still gives it .  .  . 
-1	Casual trip to White Hart Lane with the father .   # COYS  # Tottenham  # Europa League 
-1	Believe it or not this is not iOS7  # ios7  # ios6  # jailbreak  # iphone
