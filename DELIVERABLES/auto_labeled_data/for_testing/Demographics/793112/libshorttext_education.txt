3	 @ PinkOddy  @ falmouthjade Hmm not sure I understand this question .  .  Can you explain ? 
3	 @ llamasoft _ ox Does the road keep telling some bloke called Araf to slow down ?

3	 @ theenglishdad  @ dadwhoblogs  @ onedad3girls  @ diaryofthedad If you DM me your Skype ID we can test youre all working ahead of recording .

3	 @ chrismarquardt Read Enders Game and then Enders Shadow and then stop .  Speaker for the dead was good but different from enders game . 
3	 @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs How peeved would you guys be if I suggested slipping another day to record this week ? 
3	 @ PinkOddy  @ falmouthjade Usually you get over exposed highlights and black shadows . 
3	 @ Ihnatko Freaky .  Im listening to MBW right now and you just tweeted your 5 guys comment as I was hearing it in my ears . 
3	 @ petitmew Depends how bad .  Colour correction tools in Lightroom / Photoshop might work . 
3	 @ dadwhoblogs  @ onedad3girls  @ diaryofthedad Do we have  @ Secret _ Father joining us for this weeks show ? 
3	 @ PoorSpelling Man of a thousand faces ! 
3	 @ theenglishdad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs  @ diaryofthedad May as well test it .  If youre on a laptop theres a good chance you have a mic .

3	Im volunteering at the  # coderdojo event in Manchester today and its just kicking off .  Exciting day ahead !  
3	 @ R2UK come in a sec please ? 
3	 @ petitmew  # Santasbeenalready awesome !   I hope your love it !   Enjoy that f / 1 . 8 especially . 
3	Just had a quick play with the Panasonic GM1 .  This thing uses m43 lenses and is TINY !    # panasonicmums  
3	Im about to go live for a free webinar about making black and white images using Intensify Pro  -  join me !  
3	 @ MovemberUK Good heavens the movember mobile app is every bit as crashy and annoying as last year .  Back to my desktop then . 
3	 @ OneDad3Girls  @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ dadwhoblogs merry Christmas to you gents as well .  Its been a pleasure getting to know you this year . 
3	Big  # FF to my Mo Bros starting  # movember clean shaven today .   @ OneDad3Girls  @ DiaryOfTheDad and  @ asic69 Were gonna clean up with our staches !

3	 @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs And btw Im running a webinar at 10pm
3	 @ dadwhoblogs  @ theenglishdad  @ onedad3girls  @ diaryofthedad Yeah phone headphones work fine . 
3	 @ liveotherwise  @ r2uk By the way  @ adobe photoshop touch is a rather more capable mobile phone photo editor .  Its very good indeed and only £7
3	 @ PinkOddy  @ FalmouthJade sorting I dont think iphone has a backlit scene mode .  You could try the hdr mode though .  Might work . 
3	Just recorded an AWESOME episode of Love All Dads podcast with  @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs and  @ dotterel .  Will release it ASAP
3	Prepping for tonights free webinar on using Snapheal Pro to Erase ,  Retouch and Adjust your images 
3	 @ dadwhoblogs  @ onedad3girls  @ diaryofthedad Aye .  Im all set for 20 : 30
3	 @ dadwhoblogs  @ onedad3girls  @ diaryofthedad Im available tomorrow as well .  Do we have a guest for this show ? 
3	 @ FalmouthJade  @ pinkoddy Tip 2 .  Let your little one see your face ,  not the camera .  Theyll smile at you ,  not at a camera . 
3	 @ liveotherwise  @ R2UK  @ SamsungMobileUK Sorry i missed this question .  Whats up with Photoshop ?  Can I help ? 
3	 @ PinkOddy  @ falmouthjade The problem is that the difference between the brightest and darkest parts is too much for the camera to handle . 
3	 @ petitmew Spare battery is essential IMO . 
3	And I just broke my glasses .  This will add a fun extra challenge to the day . 
3	 @ dadwhoblogs  @ diaryofthedad  @ onedad3girls Me too . 
3	 @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ OneDad3Girls  @ dadwhoblogs or 8 . 30 ?  I can do either
3	 @ theenglishdad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs  @ diaryofthedad If youre on anything more than a modem your speed should be OK . 
3	 @ Kavey I always look weird .  Especially today .   :  ) 
3	About to start another free webinar showing how to integrate Intensify Pro into your workflow .  Join me at 
3	 @ toastroom  @ acedtect Sadly hes not and nor is  @ ayazakhtar .  Tom is doing 
3	Grrr Google wants me to add some chars on the end of  + Photowalkthrough for my short URL .  What the hell am I supposed to add ? 
3	 @ Secret _ Father  @ diaryofthedad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs Youre kidding .  You were excellent .  Hope we can get you back soon ! 
3	 @ petitmew Easiest is a flash bounced off the ceiling .  Or window light and high ISO .  Or a big aperture lens  -  50mm f / 1 . 8 rocks . 
3	2 hours until my first free Webinar showing how Intensify Pro can be part of your photo editing workflow .  Join me !  
3	 @ R2UK  @ kerryjeanlister I use Airmail .  The MacOS Mail app is OK but very limited .
