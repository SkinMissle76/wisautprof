3	 @ kdmcauley gird your loins !  
3	“ @ TweetNewport :  NATO summit in Newport .  What is your reaction to a multi - million £ jamboree for worlds most powerful warmongers ? ”  & lt ;  - Negative
3	 @ scnnr I dont believe this .  Pushing so - called extremes by people new to activism more likely due to desire go beyond unsuccessful tactics
3	 @ paulrogers002 not a business ,  lots of empty shops in Newport  & amp ;  various projects trying to make use of them .  This seems most laid back one . 
3	Downloaded that  # BlackBerry BBM messenger app few months back ,  maybe I know all the wrong people ,  but not sure why Ive kept it ,  very quiet
3	But open minded about how much it will relate to the  # chartist movement .  Excellent academic speaking though . 
3	Classic welsh folk from The Hennessys at the  # chartists commemoration evening 
3	 @ RobbtJay  @ stevenchapple looks pretty damning from every direction I can look at it .  Seems only a matter of time before  # SWP withers away . 
3	Advent of penny post meant sending letter became attainable for anyone .  Very little is know of  # chartist movement in Cardiff ,  this adds lots
3	Ill be on  @ BBCRadioWales Good Morning Wales show tomorrow morning to talk about  # spycops  # policespiesoutoflives probably about 8am
3	Just pre - recorded an interview about  # spycops for  @ BBCRadioWales  -  should be going out sometime in the 2 hours  # policespiesoutoflives
3	Vindictive cruelty of UK asylum policy is sickening ,  huge effort to send terminally ill to die has become normalised 
3	Downloaded  @ ihrc Know Your Rights app about being stopped at airports under Schedule 7 Terrorism Act 2000 
3	Fair play to  @ cardiff _ blues bar staff ,  recognised me and refunded me the overcharging earlier .  Faith in humanity restored ! 
3	Lazy ,  drunk ,  benefit cheats a myth ,  according to new report 
3	 @ Mayday _ magazine cheers Trev ,  have yourself a cool Yule
3	Insightful presentation of personal family history research about  # chartist William Davies .  Illuminates in a way academic research doesnt
3	 @ lePhantomPlume  @ Martinbigpigmor Madhavs ,  Vegetarian Food Studio  & amp ;  Cafe Atma would be my top 3 .  You should check out Milgi  & amp ;  Embassy too

3	Anarchists infiltrated by at least four  # spycops undercover police officers 
3	 @ RobbtJay  @ stevenchapple I stand corrected .  The partys not over yet for you though ?  Many members left locally ? 
3	RT  @ machinestarts :   " Police say they will stop deep cover moles of activist groups .  I dont trust them "  -  @ AnnieMachon  # cryptofestival  # spycops
3	Outside the Westgate hotel ,  where people are commemorating  # chartists rising by banging drums at site of 1839 battle 
3	 @ stlemur I get the impression this is a genuine reaction for many . 
3	 @ Tinychefrebel any plans to have  # vegan meals on the menu at  @ UrbanTapHouse ?   @ tinyrebelbrewco
3	Seems that whilst most attendees are pleased to see the  # chartistmural protestors singing ,  local Labour Party arnt 
3	Sometimes it seems like deadly collective punishment of  # Gaza is a Xmas tradition ,  but then you remember it happens the rest of the year too
3	It seems that the writing style of  # chartist leader John Frost is very similar to the radio persona of Tony Handcock ! 
3	copsoffcampuses :  Organising protest is becoming a risky business nowadays ,  so we hope you will forgive our .  .  .  
3	This seems the most illuminating report of recent  # SWP conference ,  explains why only the most loyal havent left 
3	Everything suggests  # spycops used sex by deception as a key infiltration tactic of their deployment ,  not a personal failing or digression . 
3	Red choir singing outside the Westgate hotel about  # chartistmural  # chartist 
3	Emily Mei Yeh be granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and is released from Yarls Wood .  
3	 @ brandnatter can you stop acting healthy ?  You coming RP today ? 
3	Idea voting most important way to honour  # chartist movement is naïve .  It was an expression of class struggle then .  We still need  # classwar
3	 @ brandnatter  @ dragonsrugby didnt last long though did you ?  were still out ! 
3	 @ Tinychefrebel  @ UrbanTapHouse  @ tinyrebelbrewco Ill take that as a no then .  .  .

3	Just been charged £22 for two pints of lager ,  a shandy and half a coke at  @ cardiff _ blues  -  cant believe how expensive it is here ! 
3	UK politicians praise  # Mandela now ,  but  # spycops used on anti - apartheid campaigners for decades 
3	Think Ive had dealings with nearly every left wing grouping in Wales over the years ,  though all politicos lie ,  most dishonest has been  # SWP
3	Good read on students ,   # copsoffcampus ,  and  # 3cosas  -  
3	 # chartist meetings continued in pubs on griffon street  ( yards from site of battle )  within a year or so of defeat of insurrection

3	Full judgement on the most recent  # spycops appeal :  
3	Helens story 
3	Excellent first session at  # chartist convention as usual .  Bad phone coverage in lecture hall ,  most tweets have been appearing in wrong order
3	Local history society has been putting on a great many  # chartist events  & amp ;  commemorations over the last 30 +  years .  Next year should be big .

3	Return of Scotch Cattle and other clandestine working class political groups after failure of  # chartist rising organised on the same lines

3	 @ tim _ eames ah !  Doesnt like that eh ? 
3	 @ scnnr heard the agent provocateur smear loads .  But everyone I knew who turned out to an undercover cop acted in a very different way . 
3	“If Welsh Government go ahead .  .  .  future for these important species in the area is very bleak "  
3	The result of the death sentences for the  # chartist leaders led to such outpourings from all sorts of quarters ,  even it seems ,  from Cardiff
3	Very pleasant evening in Bristol with  @ kilnaboyband  # nowplaying their  # noborders tune

3	 @ CosmoGuitar  @ bristolnoborder  @ 10FeetTallCF  @ smash _ edo oh how we laughed .  .  .

3	Very interesting Lady Rhondda talk ,  but bit out of place ,  if  # chartist convention covers all Newport political violence it has to be longer
3	 @ tim _ eames here it is :  
3	However by 1939 the attempts to co - opt  # chartist movement into democratic evolution of UK was underway .  Motivated by fear of fascism ? 
3	Talk on Lady Rhondda  & amp ;  womens suffrage in  # Newport next .  Bit different ,  not usually a fan of others being covered at  # chartist convention
3	 " I know the company I work for makes a fortune .  They do that by paying as little as they can get away with "
