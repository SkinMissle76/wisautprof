2	 @ realgonereviews Lost touch with Rouse musically once he moved to Spain but those first four or five records are great . 
2	 @ realgonereviews Yeah ,  we put them out for the foxes to eat ,  Theyre not that fussy about their Roses selection . 
2	Just eaten the last of the xmas chocolates .  As youd expect ,  it was a toffee centre . 
2	More people should listen to Josh Ritter ,  in my opinion . 
2	Raiders of the Lost Ark was my favourite film as a kid and still is now .   The most perfect film ever made .

2	 @ realgonereviews Listened to the Tashian EP via Spotify  -  all good .   Now for The Russians . 
2	 @ realgonereviews There some good stuff on there but not as consistant as the stuff with  @ thesilverseas
2	 @ realgonereviews  No not yet .   I did have a copy of his Sweetie album knocking around somewhere though . 
2	 @ realgonereviews Yeah that  @ thesilverseas record is great .  In fact all their records are .   Get hold of the previous one ,  High Society . 
2	 @  _ L _ M _ C _    Oh ,  if only you could turn back time . 
2	 @ realgonereviews RGR mentions The Goodies .   The Russians record is on my to listen list but from your review it ticks a few boxes for me . 
2	Lovely clip from  # DannyBaker breakfast show .  The last caller is a pip and a dandy .  
2	Another  # DannyBaker breakfast show from 2005 to start the weekend .   Leonard Nimoy is the guest .

2	If any ladies have sexy pics they wish to send me instead of  @ Jason _ Manford  Im more than happy to receive them

2	Waking up listening to  # DannyBaker morning show from 2005 .   How breakfast should be . 
2	Dont go to that party in Maidstone .  It wasnt worth all the hassle with the police afterwards .   # tweetyour16yearoldself
2	Yes HDs very nice but do we really need to see Jason Manford in high definition ,  BBC ? 
2	 @ neilbombd Carve CaB in two ?   Does this mean we have to start picking sides ? 
2	 @ LFBarfe Ha !  Nice clip of MeDinner .   Now ,  is Hirst football or muggy bonehead ? 
2	Tonight  -  feet up ,  egg sandwich ,  listening to old  # DannyBaker radio clips . 
2	 @ neilbombd  Enjoyed the podcast .   Your point that Twitter might be harming internet forum discussion needs a thread on its own . 
2	 @ LFBarfe Trying to find that outtake from the Six OClock Show where he loses his rag on an OB with a security guard .   # DannyBaker
2	 @ LFBarfe Thanks for the  # DannyBaker uploads .

2	 @ AlexJThomas Used to some years ago . 
2	 @  _ L _ M _ C _   Its Gojira . 
2	Say what you like about the Pope and the Catholic church but they did give us Father Ted .  So ,  not all bad .
