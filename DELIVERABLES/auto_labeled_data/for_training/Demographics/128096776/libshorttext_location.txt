3	 @ realgonereviews Lost touch with Rouse musically once he moved to Spain but those first four or five records are great . 
3	 @ realgonereviews Yeah ,  we put them out for the foxes to eat ,  Theyre not that fussy about their Roses selection . 
3	Just eaten the last of the xmas chocolates .  As youd expect ,  it was a toffee centre . 
3	More people should listen to Josh Ritter ,  in my opinion . 
3	Raiders of the Lost Ark was my favourite film as a kid and still is now .   The most perfect film ever made .

3	 @ realgonereviews There some good stuff on there but not as consistant as the stuff with  @ thesilverseas
3	 @ realgonereviews  No not yet .   I did have a copy of his Sweetie album knocking around somewhere though . 
3	 @ realgonereviews Yeah that  @ thesilverseas record is great .  In fact all their records are .   Get hold of the previous one ,  High Society . 
3	 @  _ L _ M _ C _    Oh ,  if only you could turn back time . 
3	 @ realgonereviews RGR mentions The Goodies .   The Russians record is on my to listen list but from your review it ticks a few boxes for me . 
3	Lovely clip from  # DannyBaker breakfast show .  The last caller is a pip and a dandy .  
3	Another  # DannyBaker breakfast show from 2005 to start the weekend .   Leonard Nimoy is the guest .

3	 @ neilbombd  Enjoyed the podcast .   Your point that Twitter might be harming internet forum discussion needs a thread on its own . 
3	 @ LFBarfe Trying to find that outtake from the Six OClock Show where he loses his rag on an OB with a security guard .   # DannyBaker
3	 @ LFBarfe Thanks for the  # DannyBaker uploads .
