29	Frankly ,  if it were not for Hushovd ,  Voeckler and GIlbert ,  this TDF would be nothing more than an elaborate French tourism  campaign
29	If any carbon tax system that fails to reward and encourage cycling is nothing more than a fraudulent money grab
29	Le Tour is just like Grand Opera .  Drama ,  hysteria ,  silly plot .  But we dont tend to ask the riders for an encore of another few stages !

29	Whats the value proposition for Local Council rates ?  Everyone else has to explain and justify their charges .  .  .

29	The only scientists I really respect are those who work on bicycle technology
29	Not that I agree with it as a policy ,  but with all this why should I pay any carbon tax bleating ,  the human race deserves global warming
