-0.4	 @ olicollett Only cos you havent delivered any . 
-0.4	 @ ECL1983 excellent suggestion .  Happy new year ! 
-0.4	 @ legsidelizzy was the whole series plan predicated on them winning the toss  & amp ;  batting first each time ? 
-0.4	 @ TimPeachBBC England should have extra points deducted for this performance .  .  .  . 
-0.4	 @ Crawf33 very good !  It just took a bit of getting used to the graphics .  .  .  But I liked the nods to the real stories .

-0.4	 @ mikewills _ sport completely agree
-0.4	Even against an England side in form ,  this Australia side might have won the series .  But England have set a new bar in woefulness . 
-0.4	That is going to hurt .  .  .  . 
-0.4	 @ ssalaga My email :  upallnight @ bbc . co . uk .  Thanks ! 
-0.4	 @ legsidelizzy Bit hard on anyone to shift around the order that much ,  let alone a newbie

-0.4	 @ JohnSunCricket  @ legsidelizzy or KP .  .  .   ( though I hope not ,  because hes still our best player by miles .  .  .  ) 
-0.4	Well that was a good start . 
-0.4	Excellent .  .  .  .   * rubs hands Burns - style * 
-0.4	 @ jameshmm is that the same theory I used when I said I was going to target Scarlett Johansson ? 
-0.4	 @ WildeV you  & amp ;  me both kid .  At least theres cricket .  .  .

-0.4	 @ niftysue  @ michaelhortin Utter madness .  Im on nine weeks of night shifts for this . 
-0.4	 @ ECL1983 You need to stop watching English batting .  In other news ,  have a drink ,  thatll help . 
-0.4	 @ plalor Sure  -  all set to change given imminent Aussie win !  Are you at the ground ?  Obviously have your number but could go to 5 live point ? 
-0.4	 @ legsidelizzy sphinx ? 
-0.4	 @ TimPeachBBC even better .  Its been a proper catastro - insert swear word here
-0.4	 @ WildeV nope .  Lardies .

-0.4	 @ iandeeley YES !  Some proper sport  & amp ;  actual competition to come ! 
-0.4	 @ ItsMarkWebster He should belt it ,  a la Warner .  No point being timid in abject defeat .  .  . 
-0.4	 @ ECL1983 1 )  KP was brought on to bowl ahead of Borthwick ,  which doesnt make much sense to me .  2 )  That was a nice pic you tweeted earlier . 
-0.4	I still think itd be a bit harsh to drop Carbs after this series . 
-0.4	 @ CharlotteFoster but on the plus side ,  they make you sound like a helicopter ! 
-0.4	 @ judyfladmark name of new channel ?  CBoobies ?  Ill get my coat .

-0.4	 @ simon _ kelsey quite agree .  Clarke is class .  Other than that .  .  .  . 
-0.4	 @ ECL1983 I bet .  Still you wangled us a wicket by waking up so Ill take that .  Have a brew  & amp ;  settle down for an interesting session ! 
-0.4	 @ WildeV It is as quiet as a mute mouse wearing slippers
-0.4	 @ niftysue wine . 
-0.4	 @ sharonsimcock was each one of them a drink of some sort ? 
-0.4	 @ olicollett Neither do I .  Producing a round table on 5 live at 4 . 45am so hopefully get some insights then ! 
-0.4	 @ WildeV have been for 3 hours .  .  . 
-0.4	Someone will have to explain that to me . 
-0.4	Yesterday decided January sobriety didnt include wine .  Today ,  drank 4 pints .  Shambles . 
-0.4	This is delightful stuff ,  but I fear it means well be 36 all out . 
-0.4	The most worrying bit of this performance is that Cook patently doesnt trust Monty enough to even give him a go . 
-0.4	 @ niftysue  @ michaelhortin cheese  & amp ;  chips ?  Thats definitely taking it seriously . 
-0.4	 @ timaviss toilet roll ?
