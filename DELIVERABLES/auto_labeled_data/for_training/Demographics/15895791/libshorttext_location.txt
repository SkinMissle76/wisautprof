45	 @ pennyb I am such a sucker for that sort of thing .  Totally going to investigate tomorrow . 
45	I probably shouldnt have agreed to do this extra shift at work .  Im going to be late  :  (

45	Vanilla spice latte was a mistake .  Blegh . 
45	Checking a chicken stock recipe .  It says use 20 chicken wings then discard them at the end .  I know theyre cheap but what a waste .

45	 @ le _ chaletLeeds thanks ! 
45	 @ pennyb yeah I know ,  nobody uses them ,  but I have found them useful for one thing  -  house hunting .  Often theyre just hassle though . 
45	 @ Hopenlesmyth ha !  It was the place .  But I dont know ,  it could be both  ;  ) 
45	 @ The _ Mr _ Cook isnt it brilliant !  Barely takes any effort at all .

45	Just heard someone use the word  " whereupon "  .  You dont hear that too often . 
45	Does anyone know why some authors wrote names as e . g .   " Mr .  R -  -  -  "  instead of using the full surname ? 
45	 @ yiwen _ h woah !  Thats terrible !  Cant believe someone thought that was acceptable ! 
45	That same article also says that PDAs  ( devices ,  not snogging )  are the new big thing .  This is only two years old ,  this article .

45	Wearing my most Christmassy jumper for tonights  @ librarysocsheff social .  Looking forward to it !

45	science has been BRILLIANT recently .  A :  
45	Look what I found in the fridge !   @ askalexsknight
