14	 @ distributedcog  @ orestesmantra provide an account of consciousness ,  but how ,  and why we should think that ,  remains extremely unclear . 
14	 @ distributedcog  @ orestesmantra I guess the article represents KC nailing his colours to the mast that this theory will somehow  & amp ;  eventually…

14	 @ kingdomjock I mean based on prejudice and parochialism ,  irrespective of the arguments .   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ louisemoody  @ GuyLongworth But socks ?  Really ? 
14	 @  _ TK _ O Yes ,  I think so .  Just glad nothing else was taken .  Obviously some kind of prank  ( or sock fetishist !  )  . 
14	 @ cmlittlejohn Yikes .  Presumably he thought he would weigh less that way !  There are some odd people about .  .  . 
14	 @ neverjessie God forbid we have any TV programmes whose plots revolve around ideas instead of relationships and faux sentimentality ! 
14	 @ hmsand Cool map !  Unsurprisingly mirrors geography quite closely . 
14	 @ lukephilosophy I think sometimes it can help to remember that the thesis isnt your lifes work ,  its just a step along the way . 
14	 @ orestesmantra A tentative hypothesis ,  perhaps ? 
14	 @ kingdomjock The trouble is ,  you can’t ask the question until you define what form of devolution is on offer ,  which requires negotiation . 
14	Energy isn’t conserved ;  it changes because spacetime does ,  by  @ seanmcarroll :  
14	 @ bowmanthebard  @ guylongworth  @ barnabywalker You might have other reasons to reject folk psychological terms ,  but it doesn’t follow from …
14	 @ BarnabyWalker  @ GuyLongworth Was thinking of similar cases of being forced to A despite desiring not - A  ( or not desiring A )  . 
14	 @ kingdomjock You might have no choice if the EU insists on negotiating conditions for reentry . 
14	 @ GuyLongworth You’re better than that . 
14	 @ martyr _ heineken  @ lukephilosophy …a particular instance of the maxim ,  “familiarity breeds contempt” ,  perhaps ? 
14	 @ garfordmoore And Cameron is one of the worst for the No campaign  & amp ;  hardly representative of the majority of Scots who oppose independence . 
14	 @ andrewdavey certain economic depression  ( worst case scenario )  or possible environmental catastrophe that depends heavily on the odds . 
14	 @ louisemoody  @ martyr _ heineken  @ lukephilosophy Yep . 
14	Youd need to ask a lawyer… “ @ RichardJMurphy :  Why is it when lawyers withhold their labour its a protest and not a strike ? ”
14	 @ seventanterpost Yes ,  I like a bit of sci - fi .  Not a fan of Red Dwarf though .   :  ) 
14	 @ andrewdavey My point was that it should ,  since the negative economic consequences will apply regardless of whether climate change is real . 
14	 @ andrewpuzzo If a dog could speak ,  we could not understand him !   :  ) 
14	 @ martyr _ heineken  @ lukephilosophy  :  (  This is surprisingly widespread ,  and most likely not indicative of the quality of your thesis…
14	 @ kingdomjock According to the Barnett formula  ( which would itself be likely to be rewritten in the event of a ‘no’ vote / greater devolution )  . 
14	Very sad news .  “ @ csandis :  Its hard to believe that Jonathan Lowe has left us .  May he rest in peace ,  I shall never forget his kindness . ”
14	 @ GuyLongworth Actually it kind of was .  3 of 4 socks  ( 1 pair regular ,  1 sport )  were missing ,  which meant I wore one sock home on the train ! 
14	 @ kingdomjock A commission on funding and finance for Wales ,  which also proposed greater devolution and tax raising powers . 
14	 @ GuyLongworth She obviously thinks the moon shines out of your… gubbins .   :  ) 
14	 @ KingdomJock That itself is very worrying .  It should be quite clear what’s on offer ,  and yet so much is vague or undecided .   @ muzrobertson
14	So now you know .   :  ) 
14	 @ muzrobertson OK ,  so about half of those would probably back independence anyway ,  but it underlines the importance of the economic argument . 
14	 @ GuyLongworth  @ BarnabyWalker Indeed . 
14	 @ rob _ cornelius Which has but a single MP in Scotland !   @ Drygyptian
14	 @ muzrobertson What surprises me is the extent to which Scots seem to have been taken in by Salmond and the SNP’s posturing . 
14	 @ andrewdavey …which is exactly what the current climate change debate is about ,  and so just another way of saying the same thing ! 
14	I don’t get this call for Cameron to debate Salmond .  Why should DC be the spokesperson for the No campaign ?   # indyref 
14	 @ GuyLongworth The worst would have been if Id still been wearing them .   :  ) 
14	Good luck to all my students sitting the  # Plato exam today .  I hope all the hard work pays off !   @ SussexPhilos

14	 @ guylongworth I’m getting a 404 from that URL .   ( Tech talk for :  it’s broken !  ) 
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday 
14	 @ farrochie Even better . 
14	 @ GuyLongworth though conveniently the characters have an extra sense with which to detect this ,  along with properties of their host body . 
14	 @ hevans567 OK ,  fair enough .   :  ) 
14	 @ kingdomjock I think Scotland has a strong voice within the UK ,  which in turn has a strong voice throughout the world…  @ muzrobertson
14	 @ lukephilosophy Two alternatives ;   ( a )  its not rubbish ;   ( b )  even if it is rubbish  ( unlikely )  ,  thats OK—it only need be good enough to pass ! 
14	 @ kingdomjock Fair enough .  What I fail to see is  ( a )  how independence will make this any better ,  and  ( b )  that it will do so in a way that …
14	 @ kingdomjock But the first step to what ,  and why isn’t this what’s on offer in the referendum if it’s so appealing ?   @ muzrobertson
14	As usual ,  Alex Salmond is deploying nationalist propaganda in a way that insults the intelligence of the Scottish people .   # indyref
14	 @ carlbaker I’m sorry to see you leaving academia ,  but can fully understand the reasons  & amp ;  wish you well with the new job ,  which sounds great . 
14	 @ allenstairs 
14	 @ kingdomjock is not available under the present arrangements or  ( my own preferred outcome )  greater devolution within the UK . 
14	 @ LeeRogers1314 That’s quite different to debating the case for and against independence with Salmond .  Where’s the evidence for this claim ? 
14	Hilarious .  Will it have the same squishy rubber keyboard ?  “ @ lucabaptista :  Geek as hell :  Bluetooth ZX Spectrum 
14	 @ kingdomjock If it chose to go into the Euro ,  whereas Scotland may be forced into it by lack of clarity about currency  & amp ;  EU membership . 
14	 @ laurenredhead x2 ?   :  ) 
14	 @ kingdomjock I fear that much of the SNP’s case is premised on just that :  hope ,  but with little of substance to back it up .   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ laurenredhead I used to have the same problem with TV reception .  Replacing the aerial lead with 1 that was properly insulated helped a lot . 
14	 @ kingdomjock I think Salmond’s rhetoric is carefully calculated to work on both levels .  The location of the UK parliament…  @ muzrobertson
14	Reading an Iain Banks novel in which the central characters can travel between nearby possible worlds .   # Transition
14	 @ kingdomjock some might say disproportionately so .  Leaving the UK would give an independent voice with little real influence .   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday much of Salmond’s rhetoric is so effective .  And he knows it . 
14	 @ walterhorn Aside from the mention of the internet  ( which could conceivably be conscious !  )  ,  one could be forgiven for thinking so .   :  ) 
14	 @ guylongworth Otherwise  ( A1 )  could be true despite the grammatical issues with ‘being aware of’ that you raise ? 
14	 @ BarnabyWalker Is it  @ GuyLongworth ?   :  ) 
14	 @ stevecooke It doesn’t .  I think they just want to see that you can go through the motions  ( or else the result of an unrealistic…  @ twshodgson
14	 @ SteveCooke  @ twshodgson But boo to the sciences anyway ,  if only because they grew out of philosophy and then forgot about us .   ;  ) 
14	 @ davidjfhalliday Whether he’s a racist or not is irrelevant ,  though I personally doubt it .  Not sure how you got that from my earlier tweets . 
14	 @ guylongworth Thanks .  Works now .   :  ) 
14	 @ kingdomjock I think that’s probably the strongest argument for Scottish independence ,  and I can see why people are swayed by it . 
14	 @ kingdomjock after that ,  any changes in Scottish policy and tax rates would be recouped for reinvestment by the Scottish government . 
14	 @ guylongworth I’ll think about this some more when I’ve a clearer head .  Brain is addled by too much Travising .   :  ) 
14	 @ guylongworth Still broken ,  I’m afraid .  Not showing up on your home page either . 
14	 @ muzrobertson My feelings exactly .  They seem to claim both that things will stay much the same  & amp ;  yet everything will be better .   @ kingdomjock
14	 @ bowmanthebard  @ guylongworth  @ barnabywalker indeterminacy alone  ( plus ,  there are 2 different notions of indeterminacy in the picture here )  . 
14	 @ laurenredhead Phew .  That could have been nasty !  In many ways ,  a lucky escape…  :  ) 
14	In truth ,  the journey to the cinema was as epic as the film .   # TheHobbit
14	 @ kingdomjock I think there would be one formula ,  but as a result of negotiation ,  not simply rolling out proposal for Wales across the board . 
14	 @ muzrobertson Right .  An interesting point . 
14	 @ kingdomjock I have no doubt that ,  in the event of a ‘no’ vote ,  particularly if it’s close ,  greater devolution will be implemented . 
14	 @ guylongworth Isn’t there a hidden premise to the effect that the grammatical form of ‘S is aware of O’ tracks that of ‘S sees O’ ? 
14	 @ GuyLongworth  @ BarnabyWalker And if this meets the conditions for trying to φ ,  then why not also evidence of the desire to φ ? 
14	 @ kingdomjock As you would with increased economic devolution . 
14	 @ bowmanthebard  @ guylongworth  @ barnabywalker What’s the argument for this claim ? 
14	 @ andrewdavey In other words ,  the diagram is misleading since the smiley face in the upper - right is not equivalent to that in the lower - left . 
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday Just pointing out that as a potential citizen of an independent Scotland ,  I have some stake  & amp ;  interest in the outcome . 
14	 @ orestesmantra Right .  Which seems quite different from standard formulations of panpsychism . 
14	 @ GuyLongworth  @ BarnabyWalker These could also be described as cases where there are conflicting desires though . 
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday Revealing of what ?  As a Scot ,  I find it depressing how many are motivated by parochialism  & amp ;  anti - Englishness . 
14	 @ guylongworth Right ,  but your argument seems to require that co - reference requires sameness of grammatical form .  Why think that ? 
14	 @ muzrobertson Didn’t a recent poll show that a majority of Scots would back independence if it made them £500 a year better off ? 
14	 @ GarfordMoore That makes him a terrible spokesman for the Yes campaign as he represents a party widely hated  & amp ;  with only 1 MP in Scotland . 
14	Science and pseudoscience about what we eat :  
14	 @ distributedcog  @ orestesmantra Interesting .  I’ve long been a fan of Tononi’s work and it would be good to see it empirically tested . 
14	 @ kingdomjock If influence on the world stage is the issue ,  then Scotland would be well advised to remain part of the UK .   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ kingdomjock is strictly irrelevant ,  so why frame the debate in those terms ?   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ davidjfhalliday I think Salmond is an excellent politician who is willing to employ any tools at his disposal ,  including stirring up …
14	 @ orestesmantra Yes .  It seems to be more a philosophical claim than a scientific one ,  but without any argument given in its favour…
14	 @ jonathanwebber The fat man is Santa ?  This changes everything ! 
14	 @ jonathanwebber I thought they were nuns ,  possibly from the Sound of Music .   @ philgeek
14	 @ orestesmantra It seems odd to call this panpsychism .  Pan - species psychism ,  perhaps ? 
14	 @ muzrobertson A combination of well - executed propaganda coupled with the worst kind of nationalism . 
14	 @ WalterHorn Nope ,  definitely a crime ,  albeit a minor one ! 
14	 @ kingdomjock I think that is exactly  @ muzrobertson’s concern .  In fact ,  very little real change seems to be on offer . 
14	 @ GuyLongworth Not really ,  since there’s no correlate of distance ,  only sameness or difference of facts…
14	 @ kingdomjock All of which is speculation .  Worst case for ind .  Scotland :  it’s not in control of its own currency  & amp ;  is sidelined by the EU . 
14	Just watched the Desolation of Smaug .  Couldn’t tell you what happened .  Something to do with dragons ?   # TheHobbit
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday What’s your take on the quality of the campaign / debate so far ?  Has there been substantive public discussion of the issues ? 
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday Then we agree .  My point was that it shouldn’t be ,  and yet it seems to play a large role in the debate ,  which is why …
14	Hailstones ?  !   # Lewes
14	 @ raymodraco To put people off ? 
14	 @ laurenredhead Oh .  In that case  / 2 ! 
14	 @ GarfordMoore Oh sorry ,  I missed that ! 
14	 @ andrewdavey Ultimately ,  it comes down to whether we should apply a precautionary principle to minimise risk of catastrophic climate change…
14	 @ ldodds Seems pretty good so far ,  though I’ve not much idea what’s going on . 
14	 @ kingdomjock I’m 100 %  with you on that one ,  but remain unconvinced of the merits of a unicameral Scottish parliament .   :  )   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ kingdomjock Yes ,  especially in terms of greater economic independence ,  tax raising powers ,  etc . 
14	 @ GarfordMoore Exactly .  Pure propaganda as usual . 
14	 @ bowmanthebard  @ guylongworth  @ barnabywalker Indeterminacy of contents doesn’t itself entail the indeterminacy of propositional attitudes . 
14	 @ lilylivingstone Would be interesting to plot that against population density .   @ juhasaarinen
14	 @ guylongworth Glad you pointed out there’s a cathedral hidden in this pic ,  otherwise I’d have completely missed it !   :  ) 
14	 @ guylongworth e . g .  If Jill sees John finish the race ,  then Jill is aware of  [ the event of ]  John finishing the race ,  or some such . 
14	I liked a  @ YouTube video 
14	 @ kingdomjock I hope you’re right .   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ kingdomjock No ,  I’m saying they might not grant an independent Scotland membership of the EU unless it commits to full currency convergence
14	Amazing .  “ @ davidr11 :  NASA Announces Results of Epic Space - Time Experiment 
14	 @ muzrobertson I couldn’t agree more .  It hardly seems to have got past the point of ‘boo’ versus ‘hooray’ . 
14	 @ orestesmantra I had a similar suspicion when reading the piece . 
14	Good point .  “ @ Drygyptian :  If Labour were in power in Scotland ,  Alex Salmond would still be leading any yes debate . ”
14	 @ BarnabyWalker I have a similar arrangement with a book that’s been propping up one corner of my sofa for the past 10 years…  ;  ) 
14	 @ kingdomjock That doesn’t follow .  Any reduction in the block grant would be a one - off adjustment to match the increase in fiscal autonomy…
14	 @ carlbaker That’s terrific .  Congratulations ! 
14	 @ andrewdavey Nice idea ,  but isn’t column A committed to the same economic consequences in any event ,  in which case it’s a choice between …
14	 @ hevans567 Er ,  so did you ! 
14	 @ distributedcog He cites Tononi ,  but what’s the confirmation ?   @ orestesmantra
14	 @ lukephilosophy Plus ,  in the extremely unlikely event that your thesis is truly terrible  ( its not )  ,  you still have time to make it better ! 
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday Of course ,  you find the same thing south of the border in the attitudes of many right - wingers towards the EU . 
14	 @ kingdomjock That seems like a pretty big gamble to take whatever way you look at it . 
14	 @ stevecooke Sadly ,  this seems to be pretty much standard these days ,  plus of course lots of forms repeating the same information !   :  ( 
14	 @ KingdomJock I doubt anyone ,  starting now ,  would recreate the HoL .   :  )  A big issue for reformers on all sides of the debate .   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ amelapay In Scotland ,  it’s traditional to say ‘Happy New Year’ to someone the first time you see them that year ,  even if it’s in April !   ;  ) 
14	 @ neverjessie An excellent point ! 
14	 @ nicholasbuzzrad  @ GuyLongworth Haha .  Excellent punning !   :  ) 
14	 @ kingdomjock In which case good luck with that .   :  ) 
14	 @ louisemoody  @ GuyLongworth To be honest ,  I dont think I want to know ! 
14	 @ laurenredhead Crikey .  Hope everyone was OK ! 
14	 @ laurenredhead I know .  Bizarre . 
14	 @ kingdomjock Agreed .  But then why keep mentioning Westminster and London as if the location were the issue ?   @ muzrobertson
14	 @ DavidJFHalliday My remark was ambiguous  & amp ;  directed against an element of the campaign ,  particularly as directed by SNP ,  not the movement . 
14	I appear to be the victim of a random and unexpected sock theft .   :  -  / 
14	 @ kingdomjock Of course such reforms would be broadly fiscally neutral .  What Scots do after that would be up to them ,  as with independence . 
14	“Not every creature has ears to hear  & amp ;  eyes to see .  Yet all are capable of having at least some subjective feelings . ” 
14	 @ kingdomjock Highly unlikely without a corresponding increase in just the sort of revenue raising arrangements that we were discussing . 
14	 @ muzrobertson Would you be in favour of independence if the vision set out was substantially different from the existing UK ? 
14	No ,  seriously .  Somebody stole my socks while I was showering after the gym !   # bizarre
14	I dont know why I said ‘unexpected’ sock theft .  Like the Spanish Inquisition ,  nobody expects sock theft .   # socktheft
14	 @ kingdomjock No ,  because regional resources are not hypothecated ,  but powers to raise ,  e . g .  ,  corporation and income tax still meaningful . 
14	 @ farrochie Surely the point is for Scots to debate the relative merits of the options .  Why not debate Alastair Darling ? 
14	 @ bowmanthebard  @ guylongworth  @ barnabywalker Why think that ? 
14	 @ BarnabyWalker True ,  though I can imagine him snacking on Zelda characters .   ;  )   @ GuyLongworth
