-0.36	 @ bpeel Tricky to legislate as  ( 1 )  CPs are not quite equal to marriages ,  and  ( 2 )  youd have to repeal / revise all laws referring to marriage . 
-0.36	 @ bpeel It would make sense ,  though tricky to legislate .  A few straight couples have been testing the law by applying for CPs . 
-0.36	 @ Radioclare Not necessarily  .  .  .  I think the plan is couples can apply to get their CPs converted to marriages . 
-0.36	 @ rob _ hawkins  @ radioclare I think the argument is ,  if CPs supposedly give exactly the same rights as marriage ,  why not call them marriages ? 
-0.36	 @ rob _ hawkins  @ radioclare Civil partnership is a legally distinct entity to marriage .   ( Marriages can be civil as well as religious .  )
