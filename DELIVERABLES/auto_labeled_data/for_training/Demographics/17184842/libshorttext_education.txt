2	 @ Radioclare Sadly (  ?  )  I wont be able to make the comparison myself  -  not enough money to make it down AND get my car through its MOT .   :  ( 
2	 @ Radioclare Wouldnt blame you  .  .  .  Im also wondering how itll compare to Letchworth .   ;  )

2	 @ JoeHearson Stalking ? 
2	 @ OfficialCallumW I think his name is  " Cutie Pie to Tea "  ,  though why hed want to call himself that ,  Ive no idea .   : S
2	 @ OfficialCallumW  ( 1 )  He has a name in txtspk ,   ( 2 )  that was his opening gambit ,  and  ( 3 )  I know youre reasonably fussy re :  rumpy - pumpy .   :  ) 
2	 @ OfficialCallumW Might be true ,  but he wont find out .   ;  ) 
2	 @ OwenJones84 I didnt ,  but mainly because the first time I saw the film  ( as a young teenager )  that scene had been cut for broadcast . 
2	 @ Addammh Mmm  .  .  .  Id hazard a guess these same people would struggle with my 7 - letter name too ?   ( This happens far too frequently ,  BTW .  )

2	 @ Addammh First class travel is generally not permitted in my sector ,  by the way .   ( Even if it is cheaper .  ) 
2	 @ Addammh Sounds like theyre keen to meet you ,  then .   :  ) 
2	 @ Addammh Not overly unusual  .  .  .  I sometimes get my travel costs covered by other organisations for meetings and invited talks . 
2	 @ Addammh Could be neither :  some 1st class tickets are cheaper than standard class .  I could be wrong ,  though .   :  )

2	 @ BulgeBoy12  @ tedburr Not yet  .  .  .  I havent had time to Twitter much outside of work  -  seeing cock pictures there is not a good idea !   : P
2	 @ tedburr  @ BulgeBoy12  @ nicefatlad Ive seen the covered  " before "  photos  .  .  .  definitely very impressive .   :  )

2	 @ DannyyBee  @ tedburr  @ BulgeBoy12 True  .  .  .  we need to banish JK to Channel 5 and bring Trisha back to ITV1 .   :  ) 
2	 @ tedburr  @ BulgeBoy12 Channel 5 is just wrong  .  .  .  Im also half of a happy couple ,  so I suspect more vomit will be coming from  @ DannyyBee .   ;  ) 
2	 @ BulgeBoy12 Glad to hear it .   :  )   @ tedburr is too nice to hurt ,  so please do look after him  ( and blow his mind )  !   ;  ) 
2	 @ BulgeBoy12 Be gentle with  @ tedburr ,  then !   : P

2	 @ bpeel Tricky to legislate as  ( 1 )  CPs are not quite equal to marriages ,  and  ( 2 )  youd have to repeal / revise all laws referring to marriage . 
2	 @ bpeel It would make sense ,  though tricky to legislate .  A few straight couples have been testing the law by applying for CPs . 
2	 @ Radioclare Not necessarily  .  .  .  I think the plan is couples can apply to get their CPs converted to marriages . 
2	 @ rob _ hawkins  @ radioclare I think the argument is ,  if CPs supposedly give exactly the same rights as marriage ,  why not call them marriages ? 
2	 @ rob _ hawkins  @ radioclare Civil partnership is a legally distinct entity to marriage .   ( Marriages can be civil as well as religious .  )
