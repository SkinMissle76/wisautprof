2	Work up late for the master class this morning  :  (  as in it started 45 min ago and Im just now up .

2	Well at least hes a nice older guy with a very northern European accent
2	About to pick up some random old guy in Hastings ,  drive him 6 hours to Grand Forks ND .  Then turn around and drive 5 hours home
2	Really wishing that I didnt find being up at 2 and later to be so nice .  I feel its a time that I can really get things done and catch up
2	Learned of a Econ test I didnt realize I had when I walked into class .  .  .  Guess I will retake it at a later point  :  -  / 
2	Cold morning ,  woke up late .  Should be a great way to start Nuvo this morning .

2	This place is kinda sketchy lol  @ CaliforniaGhost  .  .  .  oh well lets see how it goes haha
2	Its really nice when people respond to emails promptly  ( not sarcastic )  .  Hopefully the chat in person will go over even better  :  )

2	No Insanity this morning ,  going to treat today as the day of rest  ( Sunday )  and just add an extra day onto next week starting tomorrow  :  ) 
2	Im bored and unable to fall asleep .  Gah why must I be awake with no one to talk to
2	And by day 4 I mean day 3 .   ( stupid autocorrect lol )

2	Oh well enough half asleep poems with incomplete thoughts .  One more dreamer off to bed .  The start of day 2 of Insanity in 8 . 5 hours ! 
2	Ive yet to have any moments where we can truly be our selves .  Signs pointing in every opposite direction .  Ones bound to get lost in this . 
2	I know its anticipation so why not just tell me ?  Or are you just as shy as me .  .  . 
2	Just cant seem to get over the sudden exhalation of air you give every time we almost touch .  That high squeak that you dont know or realize
2	 @ Timmysimmy thats good ,  I really want to see the show once its all ready .  But alas you guys arent coming to Minneapolis lol
2	 @ heiden85 just using rice protein powder because I have many food allergies and its the only one I found Im not allergic to
2	 @ Timmysimmy so true ,  hows being back out at bad boys ? 
2	 @ heiden85 it was ridiculously challenging ,  but I am looking forward to it . 
2	First day of the Insanity Workout .  I am dead ,  hope thats a good sign lol

2	Happy 21st birthday  @ CaliforniaGhost  !  !  !  !   :  ) 
2	Wishes everyone could just tell what other people felt .  It would make things so much easier when you see a missed opportunity slip away
2	Sitting watching a party is not as fun as joining in .  Allergies suck lol
2	Had a dream that I really wish was real .  It kinda sucked being brought back down to earth as I woke up . Oh if only I werent so shy .
