1	Ive yet to have any moments where we can truly be our selves .  Signs pointing in every opposite direction .  Ones bound to get lost in this . 
1	I know its anticipation so why not just tell me ?  Or are you just as shy as me .  .  . 
1	Just cant seem to get over the sudden exhalation of air you give every time we almost touch .  That high squeak that you dont know or realize
1	 @ Timmysimmy thats good ,  I really want to see the show once its all ready .  But alas you guys arent coming to Minneapolis lol
1	 @ heiden85 just using rice protein powder because I have many food allergies and its the only one I found Im not allergic to
