3	According to Gartner ,  the one billionth Android device will ship in 2014 
3	If it makes chilly Americans feel better ,  the UK has spent past 2 - 3 weeks being battered by storms  & amp ;  drowned by floods  ( with more coming ) 
3	If MSFT really is looking at dual - booting Android  & amp ;  WinPhone surely means theyre finally admitting theyre sitting on burning platform ? 
3	Intrigued by how many Chromebooks now seem to exist  (  & amp ;  fact they took 20 %  of US PC sales over xmas )  
3	 @ Lolecule Thats a good plan !  I personally just laid a trail of torches ,  but does place limit on how far you can go .  .  . 
3	 @ David _ Cameron Im sure that promisell meet same fate as  " no top - down re - organisations of the NHS "  ,   " no rise in VAT  & amp ;   " no frontline cuts " 
3	 @ DaQuantumFro my point is cuts are mostly ideological .  Though you can never get 100 %  take ,  you can legislate away loopholes corporates use
3	It says ,   " Android can cope with the idea youre British ,  but Facebook apparently cant " 
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins In short ,  its pretty clear theres a deeply ideological aspect to austerity  & amp ;  shrinking the size of the state
3	As it turns out that last RT actually points at tutorials ,  I guess it does in a  * roundabout *  kind of way summarise news .  .  .   * facepalm * 
3	 @ aSheepie Im sure usual  " We cut public service spending ,  but its the immigrants fault they are struggling now "  will remain pervasive  :  \ 
3	 @ ryanpowerRP Better graphics ,  hex tiles  +  no more  " stacks of doom "  are very compelling .  Worth getting the expansions if you can  :  ) 
3	 @ redhatman Cheers !  Also .  .  .  is that Gaelic or something ?  It confused the crap out of Google Translate  ( although Irish I guess is close .  .  .  ) 
3	Of course ,  doesnt stop Tory types from cutting funding to public services then blaming it on the immigrants when they struggle to cope .  .  . 
3	Hopefully things are better for connection from London to Ipswich .  .  . 
3	In their defence ,  Windows 8 isnt exactly winning popularity contests at the moment  & amp ;  WinRT is a deeply proprietary framework
3	 " Were worried about new EU migration from Romania ,  so lets place NHS restrictions on non - EU migrants !  "   * facepalm *  
3	Its not looking good for Mr Cameron .  His EU referendum bill is very unlikely to become law during this parliament 
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins See 
3	 @ BrandonLive  @ stufox  @ marypcbuk  @ timanderson I think if anything Microsoft wants the 90s back !  lol
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins I seem to remember  @ uklabour set at 15 %  ,  Mr Cameron promised not to increase ,  then raised to 20 %   ( stifling growth ) 
3	 @ aSheepie I still think an EU referendum is a sensible idea ,  but I think it needs to be based on facts rather than fear like the AV one was
3	 @ ryanpowerRP exactly .  Irony is its often same people who havent been in contact for years or were communicating on other platforms anyway
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins how about coalition doubling national debt ,  3 years of economic stagnation  & amp ;  2 year delay on deficit reduction ? 
3	Re last RT :  One of main reasons I didnt buy Diablo III or SimCity 5 is because of always - online requirement so devs can just kill any time
3	 @ charlesarthur could be Google ,  Facebook  & amp ;  Twitter also use oauth to authenticate users while Apple uses some more proprietary solution ? 
3	 @ thekieran Whats it missing that youd prefer was there ?   :  )   ( is it a case of buyers remorse / missing power user features ?  ) 
3	Big problems for Microsoft after being forced to pull botched Surface Pro firmware update 
3	My aim is to get it doing most of what an Airport Extreme can do  .  .  . only with backup  & amp ;  Linux VM support instead of 802 . 11ac  :  ) 
3	Had one of my friends complain they keep getting lost in Minecraft .  There are ways and means of avoiding this !   ( eg Reis MiniMap or torches ) 
3	 @ charlesarthur Though certainly less elegant !  lol .  Though I guess if you compare to social networks / Google Apples web services are very new
3	 @ DaQuantumFro not while the current mob are in charge I suspect  ;  ) 
3	This evening is currently being filled with American TV  ( of the House  & amp ;  Castle variety )  and oven - cooked pie  & amp ;  chips  :  ) 
3	 @ lennybang  @ BritishLogic  @ hensleyplease but bourbons ,  custard creams ,  digestives  & amp ;  rich tea biscuits would be terrible with gravy !   ;  )  rofl
3	 @ AndrewWrites That said ,  point of it is to be a low cost eReader / video watching device .  On that front its great  :  ) 
3	New pet hate :  People DMing me after I favourite a tweet asking me to RT instead .  I ignore anyway ,  but now also unfollowing any who do that ! 
3	UK followers with iPhones :   @ Dan _ Anderton  ( a guy I knew  @  uni )  has a nifty app to save you money on 0870 / 0845 numbers 
3	Its surprising how upset some people get when you unfriend on Facebook .  Its just a social network ,  and usually were connected elsewhere ! 
3	Heres the top 10 stories from 
3	Seeing out the New Year in boozey style !   :  )   (  @  The Lord Nelson )

3	Civilization V is on sale for a fiver on Steam atm .   ( I have spent / wasted nearly 890 hours on according to Steam depending on your POV lol ) 
3	The joy of an open return  .  .  . no booked seat .  FGW have apparently provided one less carriage than expected ,  so 90 mins standing for me then ! 
3	Nice to know that in addition to rail fare rises theyre also jacking up cost of parking too  & gt ;  :  (  
3	 @ jjarichardson Alternatively it promotes 100th anniversary of bloodiest  & amp ;  most pointless war in history  & amp ;  memory of millions of lives lost
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins  " Check your privilege "  is widely abused to kill discussion .  Shame ,  as plenty of valid cases 
3	 @  _ TheGeoff thank you !   :  )   ( Also great follow tips .  Hadnt come across the other tweeters yet ) 
3	Top 10 apps  & amp ;  services with awesome hidden features you may have missed according to  @ lifehacker

3	Its taken until today to figure out you only need a mouse plugged in for Mac Mini to boot headless  * facepalm *  
3	As it needs restating :  Immigration overall is not a bad thing .  It boosts economy  & amp ;  tax coffers  & amp ;  more than covers use of public services
3	Alcohol - induced lie - in now over !  Presently eating things and continuing to watch my way through Castle on Netflix  ( started yesterday )   :  ) 
3	 @ bitfield  @ apjone I find in that instance its usually down to threads doing too much .  1 thread  =  1 task ,  and only as many as needed
3	 @ lennybang  @ BritishLogic  @ hensleyplease well ,  you learn something new every day 
3	Cant help thinking £25bn spending cuts could be mitigated if £35bn in missing tax materialised 
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins Indeed ,  Plus ,  having same companies that sell to us paying themselves for generation probably isnt a great plan ! 
3	 @ jjarichardson I bet everyones SO glad we bailed out people like him  (  & amp ;  the banks that lent him buy to rent mortgages )  in 2008  * facepalm * 
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins We nowhave growth ,  but this is largely due to a rise in house prices  ( help to buy could be creating a bubble ) 
3	Great to hear about this recent breakthrough which could  ( once trialled ,  etc )  cut cancer deaths by up to 90 %   :  )

3	Before this turns into an FB lovefest ,  I use Twitter  & amp ;  Google +  much more regularly myself .  Have scaled FB back to family  & amp ;  close friends
3	Youll notice one thing in common with all these services  .  .  . the price .  Not too competitive then !  
3	 @ Emmabarnett  @ lbc973 I think the word youre missing is  * some *  .  Is there a particular reason why youve decided to demonise youth today ?

3	 @ charlesarthur we also have to wonder if Apples traditional end - to - end approach plays well with web auth  ( which needs to be cross - platform ) 
3	Watching Star Wars for first time in ages .   " Thats no moon .  .  . its a space station "  still gives me chills lol
3	Apparently  @ engadget seem surprised  (  & amp ;  a little outraged )  Mozilla has delayed Metro UI port of  @ firefox for Windows 8 
3	 @ aSheepie true .  This time last year I was calling one of those people thinking we should leave .  Now I think reforming is a better option
3	 @ ryanpowerRP Also theres a very active mod community so if theres anything you find you miss from Civ4 theres usually a workaround
3	 @ thekieran Ah ok .  Im surprised you cant get a Chrome extension for the legit torrenting lol .  Also .  .  .  
3	 @ jason _ manc  @  _ Lilykins cuts were inevitable ,  but they didnt need to be as far or as fast  ( compromising public services AND growth )
