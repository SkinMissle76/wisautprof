8	 @ sauce _ pot Thats awesome ,  and you wear it well !  Double win !   : o ) 
8	 @ BarryMarelli I absolutely agree  -  and he already looks much better than he did when he first got in the side . 
8	 @ BarryMarelli Hypercritical of me ,  but he needs to work on his touch ,  too often loses the ball when it should be under control . 
8	Are we about to see the first in - match manager sacking in the Premier League ?   # LFC  # CCFC
8	Well ,  that was a fun walk home ! 
8	Christmas is finally coming to my house tonight  : o )

8	Oh man ,  this is incredible .  We are actually brilliant .   # LFC
8	 @ Demolition71 See my tweet of at least twenty minutes ago .  Dead man walking ,  especially if we score again .  And again .  And again .  And again . 
8	I wonder if Rob Jones is watching today ?   # LFC
8	 @ Demolition71 pick that out ! 
8	 @ Anttoeandknee that would be interesting .  Premier league would suit Hoddle a lot more these days . 
8	 @ Demolition71 I still think someone will get two yellows .  Possibly more likely now ?  ! 
8	 @ Demolition71 I thought it was soft at first ,  but the more I see it ,  the more I think it was deliberate . 
8	Daniel Levy looks like hes contemplating AVBs future ,  there .  .  .  .  . 
8	 @ Demolition71 Im loving this .  I know were a good side ,  but this is great .  Fancy a spurs defender to get s . o .  second half .  4 - 0 ,  at least  ;  ) 
8	Making spurs look decidedly average here .  This is fucking boss .   # LFC
8	Henderson has played two blinding passes in the last few minutes .  More ,  please !   # LFC
8	 @ PaulEdwards1973 I know ,  but he would have kept them up easily .  Theyve been unlucky in the last month or so .  Must have new man lined up . 
8	Only just heard about Steve Clarke ,  think thats a poor decision ,  he deserved more time . 
8	 @ creepytennis Cena Vs Taker ,  Vengeance 2003 .  Promo :  
8	Thierry Henry was great as a pundit on Sky Sports in the week .  MOTD viewers are in for a treat .

8	 @ liamfh  @ ichigokuto  @ androidmoira  @ DickyShambles  @ TaffaG  @ creepytennis  @ ikarai _  We shouldve seen him at the Green  @ GreenRoomSheff ! 
8	 @ IMcMillan coiffured pomodori ?

8	 @ shaunwkeaveny  @ matteveritt Struggling with chronology ,  but one of Stereophonics / Snakeheads has properly robbed the other of a riff . 
8	 @ miss _ shoobz Heh ,  hes a softie . 
8	 @ miss _ shoobz I look forward to it .  .  .  . I think
8	 @ miss _ shoobz Seriously though ,  what do you mean ? 
8	 @ miss _ shoobz Honey ,  I have millions . 
8	If Ron Burgundy isnt hosting  @ haveigotnews this week ,  theres something very wrong with the world . 
8	 @  _ Jildo _  I didnt mind their music at all ,  just perpetually puzzled at the string of incredible women he managed to pull .  Fair play ,  like . 
8	 @  _ Jildo _  Did you get the whole sex symbol thing ? 
8	 .  @ Monster _ Bets Cocaine is a wonderful drug . 
8	Still reporting promoted tweets as spam ,  with my impotent rage ,  like a man who missed the bus . 
8	Uh - oh ,  whats this ?  !  Jamies cutting in !   # ChampionsLeague  # EBAD
8	Introducing Game of Thrones :  Redux 
8	 @ BBCRadMac Is it nuclear forces of attraction ?  Up / down / Strange .  This may be a punt .   # TTTT
8	Its time to be drained again .  Have bought my nurses a tub of chocolates to say thank you for looking after me .  Aaaah ! 
8	 @ shaunwkeaveny  @ BBC6Breakfast  @ matteveritt Buffalo overload :  
8	 @ DickyShambles  @ TaffaG  @ ichigokuto  @ magicalgaz  @ nethergreen 18 ,  chiefly with thanks to the speed of Manchester !  !  ! 
8	 @ TaffaG  @ DickyShambles  @ ichigokuto  @ magicalgaz  @ nethergreen Aye . 
8	 @ creepytennis I  * may *  have insisted he stayed up and played a game with us .  Twas good ,  Castles of Burgundy :  
8	 @ creepytennis Think Jim was first to go .  Hed fallen asleep on the sofa and had woken up ten mins before me ,  Katie  & amp ;  Chid got back . 
8	 @ creepytennis yeah ,  really nice night .  Jim ,  Chid  & amp ;  I cracked out a game at 6 : 45 ! 
8	 @ creepytennis  # Bookend . 
8	 @ Matt _ Chambers _  That sentence could have ended after the word facilities .  .  . 
8	Damn you ,  fey indie musicians .  Damn you all . 
8	Having not gone to bed on Saturday may be a contributing factor .  But ,  still .  .  . there are some grim thoughts amongst the jangly guitars . 
8	Why did I wait until this point of my life to actually listen to the lyrics of Im a Cuckoo ?  .  Shredded me yesterday ,  so it did . 
8	Moyes sacked ?  !   # MUFC
8	 @ ikarai _   @ ichigokuto  @ dickyshambles ahem .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  @ ohsnapjbsmoove
8	 @ AlexGerrard7 Are you taking it bowling ?  Will you rent it shoes ?  WIll you buy it a fucking beer ? 
8	 @ MrXile Actually .  .  .  .  . there is a running gag about a blow job orgy with the band Chicago .  .  .  .  . 
8	 @ MrXile Heh !  Just dont expect an Apatow type comedy . 
8	 @ DanRebellato All of them ?  !  Thats bad luck . 
8	 @ MrXile Its a goodun .  Mostly improvised ,  too  -  bar the main beats of the plot . 
8	Heres the trailer for  # ClearHistory .  Sky Atlantic ,  9pm .  
8	 @ MrXile Yo !  Dunno if youve given Curb a go yet ,  but you should check out Clear History at 9pm on Sky Atlantic :  
8	 @ LfcDan  @ PaulEdwards1973 Wow .  Way to fuck up an average joke .  Bob - a - job threat *  . 
8	 @ LfcDan  @ PaulEdwards1973 We should call in a bob - a - job scare . 
8	 @ ParaIIeIs I just retweeted a really nice shot of Liverpool Town Hall .  .  .  . worth a look . 
8	If you have SkyAtlantic ,  you should really give  # clearhistory a go tonight .  Its a really nice ,  funny ,  non - scripted film ,  its on at 9pm . 
8	 @ creepytennis No .  Stupid mascot . 
8	I have a mascot for tonights gaming 
8	About to sample Kelham Islands The Brooklyn for the first time .  Im Optimistic . 
8	 @ liamfh Are we still the biters ? 
8	 @ liamfh so I am right .  Fancy that . 
8	 @ chriscodown It cleared up last week actually .  Sigh .  .  . 
8	I cant get to a hospital appointment because of the carnage on the trains and now I have a little bottle of piss to get rid of . 
8	 @ liamfh Oh ,  so you own them then ? 
8	 @ dansumption  @ arepeejee  @ sallonoroff  @ christhebarker Have passed this on .  Hopefully it will work ,  nice one ! 
8	 @ liamfh Calm down dear .  You dont even own your best three players . 
8	 @ ikarai _  where are you ?  Im coming into P2 NOW
8	No trains running north of Leeds .  Advice given on the train as this is announced ?   " Return home and try again tomorrow "   ! 
8	 @ liamfh Nah ,  were just Liverpool . 
8	 @ liamfh Not sure about that .  Give it ten years . 
8	Es ist sehr windig ,  ja ?  ! 
8	 @ Gregor31 Youre gonna miss all the wickets ! 
8	 @ EdinburghTrams  @ WelshIrvine I knew it had taken a while to lay those tracks ,  but .  .  .  . 
8	But ,  yknow ,  best of luck making them fucking regret booing you ,  you absolute whopper . 
8	Im not being funny ,  right ,  but youd think that ,  after eleven years ,  Moyes wouldve got on to why  # EFC fans are known as bitters . 
8	 @ Aphiyalil They hardly ever stay forever .  I just want him to win something with us .  If we could win the league ,  he would stay a lot longer ! 
8	 @ AP _ McCoy Quite right too ,  champ ! 
8	 @ AP _ McCoy  @ Robbie9Fowler Only by default ,  AP  ;  ) 
8	 @ Aphiyalil Im glad you had such a nice evening ,  and that you got to see Luis at his very best  : o ) 
8	 @ Aphiyalil Im guessing you had fun tonight ?   : o ) 
8	 @ KarenGillan2 I mainlined two large cappuccinos inside an hour and then hit the pool the other morning .  It was like I was wearing flippers ! 
8	 @ sportingintel Surely the default position is to back any team who can hold onto a wantaway star ? 
8	So pleased that David Moyes has finally seen Everton win away against a big team ,  its been a long tome comi .  .  .  .  .  . oh . 
8	£40M  +  £1 !   @ Arsenal
8	Lastkingofscotland has just saved my bets there .  .  .  . decent finish for a change ! 
8	Sigh ,  change to hospital appointment means I have to commute to Sheff  & amp ;  back  & amp ;  back again tomorrow . 
8	 @ sportingintel  @ david _ conn  @ BarbaraBell17 Dont forget Canal Street . 
8	 @ arepeejee  @ sallonoroff  @ dansumption When my boss loses EE4G it takes ages  ( around an hour )  to come back  & amp ;  doesnt default him to 3G . 
8	 @ arepeejee  @ dansumption One more thing ,  when 4G launches this (  ?  )  month I get it for no additional cost ,  and retain unlimited data . 
8	 @ creepytennis It will come as no surprise for you to learn that Danny Alexander doesnt smoke . 
8	 @ creepytennis I think we can both agree that smoking is very cool ,  though . 
8	 @ KaiKillick  " SHIT !  I totally fucked up my wrapping .  Im so sorry boys  & lt ; take Milk in hand ,  pause ,  turn to other brother & gt ;  Milk was for you .  "
