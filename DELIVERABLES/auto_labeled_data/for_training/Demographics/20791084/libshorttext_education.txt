2	 @ CovTara haha ,  for at least a month ! 
2	 @ CovTara aww ,  Ill do my best
2	 @ CovTara yeeaah Im ok ,  just having a rough couple days . 
2	 @ Arsenal  @ CovTara are they going to magically get the full 9k tickets by any chance ?  For less than 60 quid ?   # NotBitterOrAnything
2	Time to call it a day ,  a shitty ,  horrible day .  Night Twitter . 
2	I was wrong .   # DoubleGutted
2	Been avoiding the Spurs result all day so I could watch the game tomorrow but after that Eagles result thought I couldnt feel any worse . 
2	I am HANGING .  not a good condition for a few hours on the train and some massive fixtures .   # COYS  # FlyEaglesFly
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea screw you cheesy puff ! 
2	Giving in to the drink .  Night beautiful people xx

2	 @ Ollie _ ODea Im on FOX atm ,  Family Guy and American Dad .  Not the greatest but its something . 
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea Ive always argued that TDs will win you everything .  If Peyton carries on nobody can stop him .  DEN / SEA Is the one everyone wants
2	 @ ngkevinedward this window is a problem ,   still got Vertonghen to come back .  Would like someone to replace Naughton though ! 
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea Ive got Broncos Seahawks superbowl either way .  Just would like the Packers out as quick as possible
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea I know too many Packers fans ,  to be fair one is too many .  They always seem to be scripted to win !

2	 @ Lord _ Sugar  @ piersmorgan I agree as far as Piersy goes .  But get to bed old man ! 
2	 @ Tanis95  @ Ollie _ ODea That might not be what you want ,  Peter Pan looks a lot more dodgy this side of 20 . 
2	 @ SamRamm good effort !  Nighty night ,  save your energy for shouting on the Spurs tomorrow  ;  ) 
2	 @ Tanis95  @ Ollie _ ODea it wont last !  Dont worry ,  youve got support when the bad times happen  ;  )

2	 @ Tanis95 hey ,  if I was there Id have been all over it !  She dont know what shes missing  & gt ;  .  & gt ; 
2	 @ goonerburton  @ JackMouu is that the Goons transfer budget ? 
2	 @ Chelseaa _ Smilee haha ,  dont worry ,  im too drunk to take anything seriously !   whoever that is has some bloody nice pins . 
2	 @ Tanis95 cant believe she married the guy from Nickelback .  I was there for her all along .   # Gutted

2	 @ sambagnallphoto  @ liamwalker2003  @ OfficialWolves fair play !  The gills away end is awful . 
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea Im several pints ,  shots and a jagerbomb down .  Feeling confident about both games tomorrow should give you an idea . 
2	 @ BlueHotspur this tour was never gonna be a good one .  Another embarrassing scoreline on the way . 
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea which of the 795 bowl games are you watching ? 
2	Nobody ?  Alright then .  Adebayor was the answer all along and Sherwood is a legend .   # HonestyHour
2	Who wants drunk Flynny ?  I am fooooken pished !

2	 @ Corbit _ THFC I wouldve just gone with C )  ,  C )  and C )  to be fair . 
2	 @ casson281279 unfortunately not ,  think theres a commemorative plaque in the high street to remind people of the tragedy . 
2	 @ YiddyBohm pretty sure its on ITV
2	 @ casson281279 I grew up there and that is genuinely one of the most exciting stories theyve had ! 
2	 @ davidcaplin46 and Tom Carroll I heard !  Cos we havent got enough centre mids  ;  ) 
2	Berbatov to Arsenal ?  Long to Spurs ?  Transfer window is well and truly underway .   # SillySeason
2	2 hours and several misfires later .  .  .  surprisingly addictive !   
2	 @ Cheesywotsit79 ah thats a shame ,  Ive got a nice framed photo up in my room ! 
2	 @ Cheesywotsit79 Ive always had a man - crush on Robbie Keane .  Current squad prolly either Holtby or Eriksen .  Plenty to choose from ! 
2	 @ Cheesywotsit79 too right !  Weve always had all the best looking players  ;  ) 
2	 @ manicyid  @ Cheesywotsit79 is it just me or does he look a bit like Moussa now hes got rid of the fro ? 
2	R . I . P .  Huddlefro .  And all the other hairs that got cut but nobody mentions because theyre not famous . 
2	Love that Thudd getting a haircut is a major story on SSN .   # SlowNewsDay
2	 @ Tottenham _ Tel good stuff ,  cheers ! 
2	 @ hkiamil cheers !

2	 @ SjSaunders19 itll be a replay if we draw
2	Who needs sleep when youve got brightly coloured dominos to play with ?

2	 @ Troyzillakona and to you !  Hope its a prosperous one
2	 @ Pander88uk the sooner they get knocked down a couple of pegs the better . 
2	 @ TottenhamHub cant believe that Chelsea game got in before us .  What have we got to do ? 
2	What pillock thought there were 3 better games on ?  Swansea v City Id give you but the others were tosh ! 
2	 @ TottenhamHub is that some kind of joke ? 
2	 @ Bhakti1990 damn it ,  last again ? 
2	We won at Old Trafford .  No other notable results today .  Maybe ,  just maybe well be on first ?   # DoubtIt
2	Wrighty couldnt afford that break of set .  Long way back from here I feel ! 
2	 @ Kerry _ Hayward24 Wrights not even been playing that badly !  Did well that last set ,  hopefully hell make a game if it now . 
2	This final could be over very quickly .  MVG on fire !   # LadbrokesDarts
2	And a very happy new year to you too ,  Tottenham .   # COYS
2	Capoue and Dembele could be the start of something beautiful .   # COYS
2	 "  @ THFC _ TALK82 :  Cringe .  .  .

2	What night would be complete without a bit of Yaya / Kolo chanting ?  Fucking awesome way to kick off the new year .  Merry birthday mofos . 
2	Happy new year you beautiful people xx
2	2013 is going out with a bang .  Lets get smaaaashed !   @ toby2604  @ hambidgejohn  @ jbish91  # Lettuce
2	 @ OvertimeIreland thought the Browns were a bit harsh ,  Chud didnt exactly have a lot to work with ! 
2	 @ Ollie _ ODea  # SchwartzOut  # AVBIn
2	 @ 19yeti64 haha ,  could be both ,  who knows ? 
2	Just found this on a train from London to Kent ,  what do we reckon ?  
2	Its 4 . 30am and Im going to bed an extremely happy man .  What a day .   # COYS  # FlyEaglesFly
2	If youd told me halfway through the season that our Defense would send us into the postseason ,  Id have laughed you out the room .  Big game . 
2	WE MADE THE FRIGGIN PLAYOFFS !   # FlyEaglesFly
2	My heart is now going a million miles an hour .  Orton ,  thank you for doing a Romo .  Thank you .   # BeatDallas  # FlyEaglesFly
2	Oh fuck no
2	 @ mc2810 this is the most awake Ive ever been at 4am
2	 @ David _ Boreanaz  @ Eagles  @ nfl thats exactly whats happening in my pants . 
2	Nice drive ,  chewed the clock ,  into the endzone .  That could be the one .  I havent been this nervous since GB in the playoffs . 
2	CONNOR YOU BEAST !  I am so tense right now . 
2	Nothing doing tonight it seems .  Gonna have to win ugly .   # FlyEaglesFly
2	 @ PHIEagleFans again ! 
2	Those two passes to Celek aside ,  the offense has gone seriously wayward since the start of the 2nd Q .  Need to find the form again . 
2	These field goals are gonna hurt more and more if we cant put some more points on the board . 
2	Yes Nick Foles ,  I will have your babies .  Just keep doing that . 
2	 @ mc2810 well ,  thatll do ! 
2	 @ mc2810 not at all ,  started strong but the O is stuttering and the pass rush isnt getting enough pressure on Orton .  Could be a tight one . 
2	Looks like were intent on killing ourselves with silly penalties tonight . 
2	Go home Twitter ,  youre drunk .  
2	YES SHADY !   # BeatDallas
2	Cant complain at that first quarter .  Bending not breaking and Foles on song .  End this drive with a TD please !   # FlyEaglesFly
2	 @ Pander88uk Ive not seen that rule enforced once all season !   # Pointless
2	Full time ref !   # FlyEaglesFly
2	A win tonight will feel like a Superbowl .  Ill be over the moon with our season if we  # BeatDallas  # FlyEaglesFly
2	 @ PHIEagleFans Agreed ,  we shouldnt be here ,  but now that we are I want this job finished !  Another late one for me !   # BritishEagle
2	 @ meg _ thfc  @ Corbit _ THFC mostly cos theyre thick ! 
2	 @ USMNTFan0941 its the favourite insult of people who arent very creative . 
2	 @ jbish91 wronnng . 
2	Dear  @ BBCMOTD Can you please let someone who doesnt support Arsenal do the scheduling ,  just for a couple of weeks ?  Sincerely ,  Spurs fans . 
2	 @ GaryLineker  @ Shelbie _ THFC he should try being Spurs ,  weve only got two and ones impartial !  Too many Gooners . 
2	Not even bothered about being last on MotD .  We could win the league and theyd give the trophy to whoever was 2nd .  Fuck em .   # COYS
2	 @  _ Philly _ Talk think he still needs to kick a couple more FGs for that record
2	 @ OvertimeIreland Packers love having more than their fair share of luck !  Bears should have played to the whistle though .
