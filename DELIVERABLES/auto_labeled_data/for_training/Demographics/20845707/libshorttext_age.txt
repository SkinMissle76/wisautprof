-0.52	 @ GeordieLass _  was a very exciting match to watch as a neutral
-0.52	 @ Liddellpool very slow and takes a few seconds longer than everyone else to notice something
-0.52	Even though we are 2 - 1 down this is a cracking game to watch  # lfc  # mcfc
-0.52	Currently surrounded by asians  # fml
-0.52	Would be very happy with a draw .  The winner of this game will win the league mark my words  # lfc  # mcfc  # tough
