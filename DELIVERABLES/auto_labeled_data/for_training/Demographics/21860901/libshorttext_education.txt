2	 @ SteveGrant1983 Very odd .  Surely the player himself wouldnt be impressed ? 
2	 @ AskTheGaffer Craig Maskell ? 
2	Time to head back to the North Island .  .  .   :  -  (   # iow  # isleofwight 
2	Twitchface will be  # whufc manager by Tuesday .  .  .  .  . 
2	 # saintsfc might look foolish ,  but did they get exactly what they wanted from the Clattenburg row ?  For  @ Metro _ Sport 
2	Some interesting opinion in the comments on the  # saintsfc /  # clattenburg row !  
2	 @ wez Ive met her with the massive cans .  She was annoying . 
2	 @ DeanoBaggio83 Ha ! 
2	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert its a gamble not to go full strength in the early rounds .  Wigan got away with it last year . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 That is true ,  but I dont think he has ever looked particularly comfortable .  To progress we need better options . 
2	Two  # saintsfc fans on Celebrity Chase ! 
2	 @ mylesthegreen  @ MacLeTiss Mate ,  stop kidding yourself ,  some of us are too busy fighting the war to have pristine kit all the time .  .  . 
2	Tomorrows referee Bobby Madley last reffed  # saintsfc in the 0 - 3 loss to  # wba last season .  Sent 3 players off  -  all correct .   # twitterclarets
2	 @ BileysMullet  @ PompeyNev  @ rmbyres Weve done this too .  Still no evidence ,  Saints fans I know believe it was suggested but not implemented . 
2	 @ upthesaints  @ Metro _ Sport Means to an end .  .  .  . 
2	We cant risk Jos or Maya in the Premier League .  Sorry to say it ,  but they arent anywhere near good enough .   # saintsfc
2	Amazing that there is more interest in the  # saintsfc / Clattenburg complaint than Brendan Rodgers questioning a refs impartiality .  .  .  . 
2	As an ex - squaddie I can spot another ex - squaddie within seconds of first contact . 
2	CAPTION COMPETITION .  Winner gets a dip on my sherbet dib - dab !   # saintsfc 
2	‚Äú @ mrjamesgeorge :   @ crstig I think most people can !  Its a bit like gay dare ! ‚Äù That sounds like a game the Navy play ! 
2	Who do we want in the 4th round then ?  Id like Cov away ,  or any other Midlands away .  Otherwise a simple home tie .  .  .   # saintsfc
2	 @ upthesaints Its underhand and doesnt look good ,  but a period without his reffing prevents as much damage , 
2	‚Äú @ MacLeTiss :   @ crstig see or smell ?   # pongoüòâ  ( ex crab talking now ) ‚Äù Late to the conversation .  Typical .   ;  -  ) 
2	People arent forgetting he is a truly woeful referee right ?   # saintsfc
2	This looks like a middle aged woman has gone to Greece and come back with a young waiter !   # cbb
2	If Mourinho gets Luke Shaw for as little as ¬£8 million Ill get The Special One tattooed on my old fella !   # saintsfc  # howsmallcantheywrite
2	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert I still get the romance of the cup ,  but I grew up with Cov ,  Wimbledon etc winning it . 
2	 @ Toothy73  @ PompeyNev No but there isnt a special designated section for them ! 
2	 @ Jon _ Margetts It would be a massive gamble ,  I dont think Ings is good enough to replace him ,  not even same type of player . 
2	 @ Maverick85P Yep other than age and pace ,  Rickie is a far better player . 
2	If  ( big IF )   # saintsfc get a decent period without Clattenburg this will have been a masterstroke .  .  . 
2	I can only hope playing the keystone cops at centre half was a nudge to Mr .  Cortese to get his chequebook out .  .  .   # saintsfc
2	I hope the  # saintsfc players warm up with supportive Lallana t - shirts on tomorrow .   # MarkClattenburgVerballyAbusedMeToo
2	Anyone know what happened at JRods goal ?  Everyone near me thought it had been disallowed as ref just stood there !   # saintsfc  # twitterclarets
2	 @ ConnorArmstrong  @ WillFoxGolf That is no way to talk to a war hero .  .  .  . 
2	 @ ConnorArmstrong There you go then ! 
2	 @ upthesaints there is no way it was only about an apology . 
2	 @ GGalpin95  @ ESPNFC well just say then .    ;  -  )

2	 @ mylesthegreen  @ MacLeTiss I was there mate .  You wouldnt have seen me all the way from Brize .  .  .  . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983 If they give him a home game at least it might sell more tickets ! 
2	Yeah so anyway .  .  .  .   # CBB 
2	Lots of visitors to the  # saintsfc tag today !  
2	 @ Toothy73  @ PompeyNev Sorry I find small children intolerable generally .  .  .   ;  -  ) 
2	‚Äú @ BigGrantHolt :  This is the league table of Premiership wages .   # NCFC  
2	All  # saintsfc players linked with moves away played yesterday .  Think we can ignore the rumours  ( if you werent anyway )  now . 
2	The most amazing thing about the Allardyce is that hes a myth like Twitchface .  What has he ever actually achieved ?   # whufc
2	 @ RyderScott1 am I dreaming ?  Micky Quinn just said something positive about Southampton !  Surprised to hear him say a coherent sentence ! 
2	Whats Walcott done ? 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 This season he has been .  Just my opinion . 
2	Lionel Blair was in the Extras  # CBB Life literally imitating art now .  .  . 
2	 @ L1minus10 Potshot Townsend wouldnt even be in the squad if I was picking it ! 
2	 ( With  # saintsfc 2 - 0 up at HT )  Ive paid ¬£20 to watch this F *  & amp ;  % ing S *  % t  # concoursequotes

2	This is the weirdest episode of Dr .  Who yet .  .  .  .   # livingdolls
2	 @ mrjamesgeorge I live in Cov .  Only reason . 
2	 @ minterrrr I loved the first series ,  tolerated the second was utterly bored by the third .  Gave up . 
2	 @ upthesaints Im sure that was the intention ,   unprofessional ?  Yes ,  but if it works then it works . 
2	 @ BileysMullet  @ PompeyNev  @ rmbyres Hows the atmosphere at Fratton anyway ?  Pompey mate reckons its dreadful .  You want to buy the system ?   ;  -  ) 
2	 @ Will _ Turner71 Ah yes now I get it .  He was TA though .  Doesnt count . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983 And there was trying to be ref positive  ;  -  ) 
2	 @ ConnorArmstrong Seaborne is on loan at Coventry . 
2	Scarily it seems some  # saintsfc fans would cash in on Rickie and replace with Ings . 
2	 @ cdvdtz Id go . 
2	 @ HeyGeno I wouldnt have thought so ! 
2	Forest have got  # whufc tied up in NOTTS .   # nffc  # hereallweek
2	That injury is bad news for England .  Walcott without doubt a starter in best XI . 
2	 @ HantsOnlyTeam Let them have their day Nick ,  they dont get many ! 
2	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert Modern fans bored of same old teams winning it ,  and clubs would rather come 4th in the league . 
2	 # saintsfc have inadvertently made Mark Clattenburg some sort of hero .  That is some going ! 
2	Poor attendance today .  If you want club to take cup seriously perhaps you should too .  .  .   # saintsfc
2	 @ PompeyNev No problem with that .  Use of the word embarrassing by fans of some clubs deliciously ironic though .  .  . 
2	 ( After Davis save from Ings )  SEE I told you Davis was out best keeper ,  I dont know why we bother with Boruc .   # concoursequotes  # saintsfc
2	 @ mylesthegreen  @ MacLeTiss No matter how far back we got ,  the RAF were always further .  .  .  . 
2	 @ BileysMullet Can you imagine the excuses when the ofsted report came in .  .  .  . 
2	OF COURSE Adam Lallana has changed since playing for England ,  his kit would stink otherwise .  .  .   # saintsfc
2	 @ PompeyNev  .  .  . another thing Clattenburg has penalised us for !   ;  -  ) 
2	‚Äú @ lukeymoore :  What is Paul Merson actually talking about‚Äù Answers on a postcard to Moron Mumblings Competition  @ FootballRamble . 
2	 @ mylesthegreen  @ MacLeTiss  .  .  . and vice verse in my experience .  In Iraq the RAF techs were coming to is for help .   # amateurs
2	 @ Baldsaint He told Japanese media that he can leave and is in talks with Marinos . 
2	 @ alex _ crook  @ Joe _ Batchelor Interesting that it is a bigger deal than Rodgers who accused a ref of impartiality ! 
2	 @ upthesaints Leaked at other end I was told .  .  .  . 
2	So this is what Cliff Richard was on about .  .  .   # livingdolls
2	 @ MattSmithSFC Dreadful . 
2	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert Add to that having final on same day as league fixtures ,  late kick offs etc .  its no longer special . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 He was awful on Saturday .  I cant believe anyone would think otherwise . 
2	 @ PompeyNev Point is weve had him plenty of times and it hasnt evened out yet .  Dont want to sound paranoid ,  but evening out is a myth . 
2	 # shelfie 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 They arent nonsense ,  he gave the ball away at the back too often to be trusted . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 On Saturday he barely completed a single pass . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 Low blow because I dont agree with you on the abilities of a player ?  Fair enough . 
2	 @ PompeyNev Incompetent .  Saints have not won a game hes taken charge of and been victim of several poor decisions . 
2	An unnamed club had bid 400 million euros for Messi .  .  .  .   # saintsfc 
2	 @ BileysMullet  @ PompeyNev Weve done this a million times ,  when you can produce the evidence .  .  .  . 
2	CAPTION COMPETITION PART 2 .  Winner gets some of Gulys toenail clippings .   # saintsfc 
2	Great strike / questionable celebration by  @ Nathaniel _ Clyne .  Scorcher .   # saintsfc  # twitterclarets
2	Hate to be blunt but move back to to Japan for Maya is best for all parties .  Shown when called upon that he is out of depth  # saintsfc
2	 @ BembridgeFish It doesnt ! 
2	 @ rich _ parker I hope youre joking with Shawcross .  We need defenders who are comfortable with the ball at their feet ! 
2	Im not saying Ings is a bad player ,  but more like JRod than Lambert .  Would be a big gamble .   # saintsfc
2	 @ GGalpin95  @ Mike7167  @ Maverick85P I thought he was playing well until the knock . 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 Fair point ,  but has been dreadful this season .  We need defenders comfortable on the ball the way we play . 
2	Now well see a lot more of Andros .  Potshot Townsend .  Sigh . 
2	 @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert Seen loads of fans on here talking about taking it seriously ,  yet tickets not selling .   # hypocrites
2	 @ SassyBrew1  @ Baldbarbarian  @ GGalpin95 Asking questions is fine ,  its the ones who are making screechy noises and arent interested in game . 
2	 @ PompeyNev I firmly believe it is all a ruse to get Clattenburg away from our games .  Worked for Chelsea and Everton  . 
2	Imagine being so incensed at an opposition player telling you the score you already knew that you pelted stretcher bearers with coins .  .  . 
2	Well we got away with that .  .  .   # saintsfc  # twitterclarets
2	 @ DeanoBaggio83 What were they ? 
2	 @ PompeyNev I find the reasoning bizarre ,  Saints should be complaining about his performance rather than his banter . 
2	 @ PompeyNev Rodgers actually mentions where ref was from ,  I think hes got off lightly with that . 
2	Jim Davidson in Big Brother .  .  .  . 
2	Ill take that .  .  .   # saintsfc  # ytfc
2	 @ RF _ Travel _ News I got the 10 : 45 !  Surprisingly smooth ! 
2	 @ gregvul  @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 I did say it was best for all parties .  If he wants first team football in a World Cup year then .  .  . 
2	In Roger Johnson ,   # whufc have just bought their Callum Davenport .  Relegation beckons .   # saintsfc

2	 @ mikenairn8 Very true . 
2	There is just something about military service that sets us apart from regular people .   ;  -  ) 
2	 @ upthesaints Of course he will ,  but when ? 
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ upthesaints Sounds more plausible .  Weird that they would leak it ,  they must know what it looks like . 
2	I didnt see enough in Danny Ings to suggest he would get in the  # saintsfc team .  Faster than Hooiveld ,  but so am I .   # twitterclarets
2	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 That doesnt make them wrong though does it ?  Unless you are suggesting that your opinion cant be questioned ? 
2	So the Lions are to be managed by the Weasel .  Unlucky  # millwall
2	 @ SteveGrant1983 you think ?  Be interesting if they do . 
2	 @ AfcSoton Stay in Newcastle .

2	Where should  # saintsfc be looking to do business in this window ?  For  @ ESPNFC 
2	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert No I meant Wigan didnt play their best side in the early rounds and went on to win it ! 
2	Is it harsh of me to suggest small kids should only be allowed in the family section ?  They just really annoy me .   # saintsfc
2	 @ BileysMullet  @ PompeyNev 1 .  A lesson learnt .  2 .  A myth .  Would list yours ,  but you know ,  140 character limit .   ;  -  ) 
2	 @ Handbags82 The comment isnt I agree ,  but Clattenburg is consistently awful in our games and gets away with it . 
2	 @ Maverick85P No !  Now youve made me think it even more ! 
2	 @ MCR _ Wake _ Up  @ HeyGeno Scarily ,  the last series was one of ITVs most watched shows .  .  .   # BrokenBritain
2	That sort off Big Brother and a war hero .  Scenes .  
2	OGS talking about England wasting Paul Scholes talent .  So true ,  so frustrating .   # mufc
2	 @ SteveGrant1983 I dont think they will personally . 
2	 @ saintbags Cant replace him for that money in my opinion . 
2	Im not calling you Dappy ,  whats your real name ?  Nathan .  Its a good name .  
2	 @ minterrrr  @ HannahKMinter I thought the price was ok ,  fair enough on distance though . 
2	 @ Maverick85P Have to admit ,  yesterday was first time I thought he might be off .  Didnt celebrate his goal really ,  looked sad . 
2	 @ rich _ parker we play from the back though need someone technical like Lovren . 
2	‚Äú @ AngryBritain :  Cheers fella !  
2	 @ wez No transgender .   # fail
2	 @ Handbags82 It is odd ,  waiting for the other side of the story .  Clattenburg deserved complaining about though . 
2	 @ GGalpin95  @ ESPNFC I know ,  I dont do the pics .  .  .
