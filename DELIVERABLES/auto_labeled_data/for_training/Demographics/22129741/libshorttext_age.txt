-0.5	 @ JeremyG _  _  and what a travesty that is

-0.5	 @ FailboatSkipper Damn straight . 
-0.5

-0.5	MOAR . BANG . FOR . YOUR . BUUUUUUUUUUUCK
-0.5	How has Taka Michinoku not aged in the last 15 years . 
-0.5	 @ wutang _ dan Hes seriously holding Clouds sword .  I love Japanese wrestling . 
-0.5	Okadas holding a giant sword .  This is already the greatest PPV of all time . 
-0.5	Im presuming that joke was already made . 
-0.5	Why is Road Warrior Animal on the darts ? 
-0.5	So Im presuming the board is dead atm ? 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad Ah well ,  least I can deal with the disappointment of the result now . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad AND THATS THE MAIN EVENT RUINED THANK YOU . 
-0.5	Oh I hate kids so much .  Im glad I never was one . 
-0.5	Instead Im sat in the barbers next to the utter most shitehorse of a kid .  Hope he gets his fucking ears cut off . 
-0.5	All I want to do is go home and watch the New Japan show . 
-0.5	Genuinely didnt know celebrity big brother was still a thing .  Get Vinny Mac and Vinny Tan in and well talk . 
-0.5	 @ scanElee I am horrendously jealous . 
-0.5	Hey you !  Listen to me babble on about Royal Rumble 2000 ,  as part of  @ voiceswrestling month - long Rumble recap .  
-0.5	Having never seen it before ,  I can confirm that Kikis Delivery Service is a wonderfully charming little film . 
-0.5	You can all have your Sherlock .  Im going to talk about Royal Rumble 2000 for an hour . 
-0.5	 @ TeletextsMrT one can hope . 
-0.5	Not even a full day into the year and someone has already died . 
-0.5	Im not aiming particularly high ,  I know . 
-0.5	NYResolution :  hate everything just that little bit more . 
-0.5	Enough with the fireworks .  Some of us have to be up at 5 . 
-0.5	Half hour till the end of the year ,  and Im testing video capture software . 
-0.5	 @ Biggs1987 Nah Ill be fine .  Happy new years to you and the family x . 
-0.5	 @ Biggs1987 Mum . 
-0.5	And thats my New Years ruined . 
-0.5	 @ JESUSvALLAH My mate banged on at me for ages that its good  -  so Im taking his word on it . 
-0.5	Rouge Legacy ,  Gone Home ,  Gunpoint and Papers ,  Please for about £15 .  Happy New Year ! 
-0.5	 @ JackBaker1311 pretty much any WWF video between 97 - 01 has the most spastic of arguments along those lines  -  its beautiful . 
-0.5	Still beats a real Papa Roach song .  .  .  or Nickleback .  lolz . 
-0.5	Just noticed that its essentially a knock - off Pantera song . 
-0.5	They played an old school Raw theme .  .  .  I feel all tingly inside .   
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Gee ,  thanks .  HAPPY NEW YEAR .   ( we should do a podcast soon )  . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Hah .  Im tragic ,  but not that tragic . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris I was ,  but I couldnt hack going into work on an hours sleep  -  not worth the hassle . 
-0.5	Holy shit its Brad Maddox .  .  .  Im ending Raw here  -  aint getting any better . 
-0.5	Holy shit a Roman Reigns chant . 
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan Theyd find a way to ruin it and turn it into Russle Howards Good News . 
-0.5	Listening to Giant Bomb trying to make a top 10 games of the year list has been a superb train wreck . 
-0.5	Id say 2013 was rubbish ,  but I did meet Jushin Liger AND I just got £155 for my old iPhone .  So it could be worse . 
-0.5	 @ zoeisamardybum thats the nicest thing anyone has said to me in at least a month . 
-0.5	 @ zoeisamardybum Im failing to see the improvement . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad ITS MAH WORLD MAH WORLD . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad tbf me and Alan tried to remember every TNA champ and struggled like hell . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad The more important question is how do I remember this and still get laid . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad Which was also the debut of Dreamer wearing MMA gloves .  .  .  I think . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad They had an I Quit match at No Surrender that year  -  if Im correct . 
-0.5	 @ voiceswrestling robinsonm1988 [ at } googlemaildotcom
-0.5	 @ voiceswrestling Hey Id be up for that ! 
-0.5	Eve - ah ! 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad Just throw it on easy .  Im no good at strategy games ,  but its streamlined in a way that its approachable for idiots like us . 
-0.5	I have a soldier on XCOM called Adam Jones .  Cue me listening to nothing but Lateralus while playing . 
-0.5	 @ mikeVSphilly Which would be fine if it werent for the fact every other entrance was the fucking nWo theme . 
-0.5	 @ daveryanIV BEAutiful . 
-0.5	 @ mikeVSphilly For some reason ,  my biggest pet peeve is the fact you can barely ever hear Dave Penzer announcing anyone . 
-0.5	 @ mikeVSphilly The differences in the level of production in the next 5 years is borderline hilarious . 
-0.5	 @ mikeVSphilly Of all the things to be annoyed about on a WCW PPV .  .  . 
-0.5	 @ HollywoodAsia  " Hey man ,  its Alex Wright  -  the German .  " 
-0.5	 @ theneedledrop I knew there was a reason I liked you . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad I would have thought the same  -  except its channel 4 ,  and id expect no less from that bunch of fucking mentalists . 
-0.5	What a horrifying television product . 
-0.5	Ok ,  what the hell is / was Sex Box and why does / did it exist . 
-0.5	If Blurred Lines is not erased from existence at the strike of midnight on Tuesday ,  Im calling for a full on apocalypse . 
-0.5	 @ lucyjamesgames  @ ThePCCLondon  :  ( 
-0.5	God how I have missed Barry Shitpeas . 
-0.5	I eat so fast that Im not entirely sure that pizza ever existed . 
-0.5	 @ Tanuki _ Suit One of these days Im getting you checked in for rehab . 
-0.5	 @ Tanuki _ Suit Sunday night sorted . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Cool ,  tall egg nog latte ? 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Allo ,  wanna do summin tomorrow ? 
-0.5	I know Americans have a tough time pronouncing certain words .  .  .  but seriously ,  Ronaldo is not that difficult .   # UFC168
-0.5	 @ FunkMasterFinch He spoke into a glass one time and thought  " I have an idea .  " 
-0.5	ITS TIIIIIIIIIIIIME . 
-0.5	 @ GregorSwanson Pretty sure every main event from mid 96 till the end of 97 was Hogan Vs Piper . 
-0.5	 @ ultrabrilliant Collect treasure to buy items to help you through the levels . 
-0.5	 @ GregorSwanson Other than Starrcades and Halloween Havoc 98 ,  they all blur into one . 
-0.5	 @ ultrabrilliant How about Half - Life 2 ? 
-0.5	And even watching these PPVs in fast - forward  -  Im already sick of the nWo theme . 
-0.5	I have watched far too many WCW PPVs over the last few days . 
-0.5	 @ mikeVSphilly LOL
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Seriously ,  the moment ANYTHING happens ,  everything grinds to a halt . 
-0.5	It takes a certain degree of intensity out of the game ,  ykno ? 
-0.5	My scientist currently keeps losing her eyebrows every few seconds . 
-0.5	I dont know if its just the PS3 version ,  but there are moments where this game ,  graphically ,  freaks the fuck out . 
-0.5	 @ wutang _ dan  @ robmcauslan  @ andihero Honestly say its worth a second listen .  I love it as much as Bends / Computer era Radiohead . 
-0.5	SO MANY OPTIONS DAMMIT . 
-0.5	Its the reason I flounder at multiple choice questions . 
-0.5	I was really enjoying XCOM up until the point it forced me to make decisions for myself . 
-0.5	 @ wutang _ dan  @ robmcauslan  @ andihero I refuse to let Bodysnatchers from In Rainbows go unnoticed . 
-0.5	Right ,  fuck off twitter .  Gonna play some XCOM . 
-0.5	Im about to play GT6 .  Why am I doing this . 
-0.5	Bah Gawd ,  Tom Huddlestones getting a hair cut . 
-0.5	Turn on the Utd game to see it say Norwich 6  -  0 Man Utd and nearly had a panic attack . 
-0.5	 @ kkelsay  * BANG * 
-0.5	Four Horseman theme stuck in my head this morning . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Full .  .  .  figured it was better to be safe . 
-0.5	PS3 :  2 and a half hours to format ;  XBox 360 :  2 and a half seconds . 
-0.5	Ronin 47 :  Keanu Reeves stars as Keanu Reeves ;  a half Samurai ,  half demon - thing whos still surpressing a bogus adventure from 20 years ago . 
-0.5	Bask in its glory .  
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad YES YES YES .  Still one of my favourite games of this year .  Its bonkers ,  but a fun kind of bonkers .  And the combat is bitchin . 
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan  @ TheBarrylad A  ( un ) healthy balance of the two .  The mechanics of the last boss fight is Platinum  -  but the script is all Kojima . 
-0.5	 @ TheBarrylad You can apply that to Metal Gear as a whole . 
-0.5	 @ HollywoodAsia well played ,  sir . 
-0.5	 @ wutang _ dan Newcastles defence made up of right - back ,  left - back and RyBack . 
-0.5	 @ wutang _ dan  @ andihero The crossover appeal of Joe Kinnear appearing on WWE television .  .  .  fucking magic right there . 
-0.5	How the hell does it take the Playstation 3 over 2 and half hours to format 40GB . 
-0.5	 @ SimonMiller316 Did you drop the big leg onto a member of staff ? 
-0.5	Vincent Tan with the biggest double cross since Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty . 
-0.5	And the 3DS XL seals the title of console of the year .  
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Nice ,  get my 500GB PS3 today ,  so will have a look . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris love the little bastard .  Also ,  I have no work Monday .  .  .  . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris the cat finally got the job done . 
-0.5	 @ Jeff _ Tanton always because Spelunky . 
-0.5	Can we skip new years and get straight to the Royal Rumble please . 
-0.5	 @ PrayForPatrick always the vegetarians
-0.5	And no Im still not playing Last of Us .  The clickers can fuck off . 
-0.5	I could do about 30 minutes of Rouge Legacy and count that as playing it ,  right ? 
-0.5	I suddenly have about 30 games I want to play before the end of the year . 
-0.5	
-0.5	Fuck that . 
-0.5	Good lord what a strike . 
-0.5	 @ WordsFromNiner Yeah there isnt a whole lot to pick from on the next - gen stuff .  Although I reckon youll lurrrrve some Assassins Creed 4 . 
-0.5	Two minutes in and Im happy to call Soul Sacrifice the worst game I have ever played . 
-0.5	 @ RachelHickleton night night ! 
-0.5	Oh and the weirdest thing about WCW in 99 ?  Perry Saturns attire . 
-0.5	Take for instance the next PAY PER VIEW match was Scotty Riggs Vs Mikey Whipwreck . 
-0.5	I know thats on a long list of things that were weird around that time .  .  .  but still . 
-0.5	The Sandman in late 90s WCW is still fucking weird . 
-0.5	 @ iamIRONSman Blame Vegeta x
-0.5	 @ iamIRONSman SUCK IT ,  JABRONI . 
-0.5	 @ Alan4L mothrrfucking Blitzkrieg . 
-0.5	Never thought deleting a mii would be a cathartic experience
-0.5	Watching Man of Steel for the first time and its essentially like watching a live action version of Injustice . 
-0.5	Ive never looked creepier
-0.5	Cream soda and brandy .  .  .  .  Needs work . 
-0.5	 @ tonyrobinson666 what time you 2 getting round ? 
-0.5	A lil bit of late 90s WCW cruiserweight action to start this beautiful Xmas morning . 
-0.5	Let the eating commence . 
-0.5	 @ tonyrobinson666 ready eddy . 
-0.5	 @ RachelHickleton better have not given me one ! 
-0.5	Merry Christmas people who live in my computer and phone . 
-0.5	Taken about 4 hours to watch this film because of the sodding turkey . 
-0.5	 @ nevillelobo aye .  Hes Fin baddass . 
-0.5	I somehow forget that Henry Rollins is in Heat . 
-0.5	Doing Xmas the right way .  
-0.5	My plan this evening is to make Heat an annual Christmas film . 
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan But again .  .  .  
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan Ok ,  the big Dave leap was summin special . 
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan Booker ,  JBL ,  Khali .  .  .  there may be a trend here . 
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan To be fair ,  Batista had been pretty dreadful for most of 2006 . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris Somehow managed to go to Sainsburys and not buy a Wii U . 
-0.5	Dear everyone :  please dont go thru self service tills with a shopping trolley . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris yup .  Wanna see the Griffalo .  Be round about 3 ? 
-0.5	In such festive spirit that I currently have the thong song stuck in my head . 
-0.5	Pretty sure that Vincent Tan is Sonny Onoo . 
-0.5	 @ GolazoDan 
-0.5	 @ iamIRONSman Saw it .  Loved it . 
-0.5	I think his Rob Halford outfit was his finest moment .   
-0.5	 @ TeletextsMrT I wouldnt have expected anything less . 
-0.5	More of this .  
-0.5	The match can be 5 minutes long for all I care .  I want two months of shit - talking . 
-0.5	I want Batista / Lesnar for Mania  -  that is all . 
-0.5	Cramp in my shoulder for about 12 hours now .  Kinda bored of it now . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris God damn ,  you got a Wii U ?  Hows it look on the new cinema screen ? 
-0.5	This guy .  
-0.5	 @ kezamacdonald Board games ? 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris I do .  But Ill eat them just out of spite  :  ) 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris I finish at 2 on Monday / Tues . 
-0.5	 @ TheRussMorris I currently have wrestling on and Im playing Zelda .  So only a little . 
-0.5	Of course Id have work at 6 the next morning . 
-0.5	Im actually going out and being sociable on NYE . 
-0.5	Oh god 
-0.5	Still my favourite video of the year .  
-0.5	Fuck it ,  back to Elton John . 
-0.5	Hello Google play  -  Im giving you a chance here ,  but if youre gonna put Stone Sour in the metal radio section ,  youre not going to last long
-0.5	 @ voiceswrestling Part of his problem is that out of his 62 reigns ,  hes only had two of any length and notoriety  ( late 07 - 08 )  and  ( 2011 )  . 
-0.5	 @ voiceswrestling hes the most interesting hes been in a LONG time .  So I kinda have no issue with him having the belt atm . 
-0.5	 @ voiceswrestling comes down to who he is in the ring with .  The Bryan match on Monday was superb .  Doubt he could do the same with Fandango .
