36	 @ Razorlight Before I Fall to Pieces
36	London Town Rocks ! 
36	Back in civilisation .  Never attempting that drive on a Friday afternoon again :  Manic !  Although ,  better than being at a bus stop with Chavs . 
36	Packing .  Sensible shoes .  Not Heat .  Although .  .  .  Essex .  .  .  you never know .  .  . 
36	Packing
36	I bought a Garmin .  Still not looking forward to the move North . 
36	Moving to Essex for 2months is not as bad as Afghanistan for 6months .  All about perspective .  Thoughts are with the 3Rifles as they deploy . 
36	Decided .  Essex it is .  Ik . 
36	God ,  is it only Tuesday ?  Need the weekend .  Although weekend means decisions .  Cant bloody win .  Could it at least stop raining ? 
36	bleh
36	Rain .  Ik .  Glad to be home now at least . 
36	Back to the grind .  And soon to be unemployed .  Good week ? 
36	I want Arctic Monkey tickets for my birthday .  Buymeee ! 
36	Looking forward to a Saturday night in ,  watching Strictly . 
36	TGIF .  Oh ,  its not ?  Is for me ,  suckers . 
36	Skint til Friday .  Crisis . 
36	Downhill til the weekend !  ! 
36	Completely skint .  Bugger . 
36	Loving listening to TUKS fm live online .  Rock the SA choons ! 
36	I survived Monday !  Yay !  If only I would get paid ,  like would be sweet . 
36	Blue Monday . 
36	Being unemployed /  on holiday for sooo long ,  Id forgot all about the Sunday Night Blues .  Bugger . 
36	 @ parlotones UK ?  Really ?  Yay !  !  Where can I find the tour schedule ? 
36	What happened in Singapore ?  ? 
36	Just realised Im gonna miss the grand prix today .  Bugger . 
36	What a great train trip home last night .  Saw something scary ,  something cute and something funny .  Eventful day . 
36	Sunshine !  !  Yay ! 
36	Admin mostly done .  Is it weekend yet ? 
36	Day off !  Yay ! 
36	Had lunch in a quiet ,  sunny ,  beautiful little green oasis in the middle of London .  Love this job . 
36	Jealous of all those in SA having a looong weekend .  Long weekend will have to suffice .  Its Friday ! 
36	The girl in the supermarket checkout in front of me was buying sanitary pads and cream cakes .  Think every girl can relate . 
36	First day of work completed .  Pretty successfully I think . 
36	Not looking forward to the early start tomorrow .  I guess thats what real grown - ups and responsible adults do . 
36	Last day of being a drain on resources .  Its been great .  Bring on the positive contribution to society and that salary cheque ! 
36	Finally moving into my own room .  Good riddance sofa bed ! 
36	The wine was so worth it .  One glass was enough . 
36	Hope the wine is worth the travelling and the high possibility of getting lost . 
36	Its saturday .  hmm .  Stay home alone or go out with pretentious people ?  At least there will be vodka . 
36	Friday night lonely .  A special kind of lonely . 
36	Decisions !  Oh no !  I didnt realise being all growed up meant deciding things ! 
36	Job ! 
36	If this is a rom com ,  kill the director
36	RIP Patrick Swayze ,  Keith Floyd and the Humpback Whale in the Thames
36	RIP Patrick Swayze
36	I dont wanna be all growed up .  Cant I just play ? 
36	One step closer to being a grown up . 
36	Today was going to be a  " being a grown up "  day .  .  .  Dont think getting out of bed at 11 sets the tone
36	Wondering what the week will bring . 
36	Sunday night
36	Excellent F1 .  The weather looked beautiful in Italy .  I should be there . 
36	Grand Prix !  !  The weather is crap ,  was going to stay inside all day anyway ! 
36	Fragile ,  but not broken .  Leaving Camden for the Grand and 3night busses home .  Living the dream ,  baby .  Living the dream . 
36	As predicted ,  I fell over alot .  Ow . 
36	Put your Party Pants on .  .  .  Its Roller Disco Time ! 
36	 " If this is a rom com ,  Kill the director " 
36	Procrastination
36	Sunshine in England !  Glorious ! 
36	Why is everyone online ?  Ambushed ,  and distracted .  I dont have time ,  or enough co - ordination to chat to everyone ! 
36	Today might be the day to bring order to the chaos .  Probably not ,  though . 
36	Idle
36	Hangover .  Bleh . 
36	It seems as though a sparkling personality might just be enough
36	Tired of being unemployed
36	Suffering the after - effects of the weekend .  What a funtastic time . 
36	What a weekend :  pizza ,  drinkin games ,  Jager - bombs ,  scary cab drivers ,  SKANDAAL ,  lunch - time - hangover cocktails .  .  .  And theres still tomorrow ! 
36	Might be moving to the coast . 
36	Unemployed and homeless .  Kinda like being on holiday ,  only not .  Being broke doesnt help . 
36	3 Festivals ,  3 Countries ,  one month ! 
36	Being a proper grown up . 
36	Busy morning . 
36	Wow .  When last did we see McLaren v Ferrari ?  ?  Good GP . 
36	Girly day painting toenails ,  straightening hair ,  knitting .  .  .  watching F1 and Top Gear .  .  Good day . 
36	Wow .  What a qualifying session !  Is Alonso on pole ?  Nobody knows .  I hope Massa is OK :  that was a pretty hectic crash . 
36	Had a fabulously productive and and Im now well on my way to being a proper grown - up .  .  .  sort of .  .  . 
36	Trying to be a real grown - up ,  and failing miserably .  .  . 
36	Had a fabulous day sight - seeing ,  punting on the river cam ,  and drinking cocktails with my partner - in - crime .  Poured with rain ,  but still fun

36	I spent the whole day shoe shopping and came home with bags full of stuff ,  but no shoes .  Damn .
