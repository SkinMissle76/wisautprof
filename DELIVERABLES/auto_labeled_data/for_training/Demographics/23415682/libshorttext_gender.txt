-1	 @ MartinHatch  . com or self hosted ?  got a plugin thats interfering ? 
-1	 @ MartinHatch  .  .  .  that sounded just like a standard SharePoint diagnosis .  .   " on - prem or cloud ?  any WSPs installed ?  " 
-1	 @ TashasEv awesome !  Progress feels great ! 
-1	 @ WahVa Me neither ,  finding more and more things MS stores  & amp ;  syncs ! 
-1	 @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247 Why do you think we dig consultancy ?   : P
-1	 @ WahVa I reckon the SSID and key is stored with my Microsoft account
-1	 @ richardosman Im guessing this is why :  
-1	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Also note ,  Im a new customer and have not yet received a bill ,  however Im not making monthly payments yet til I know . 
-1	 @ speedmonkeycouk Id say the first point depends on the road ,  sometimes the surface is shite on the edges ,  best to keep in middle
-1	 @ WahVa It probably caches everything about my MS account when I was back at home
-1	 @ d4vinder Which means its an hour into it on E4 HD  -  shame theres no HD on  + 1
-1	 @ WahVa Very much so ,  I wonder if the schema for whats stored locally is publishde anywhere
-1	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams Hehe ,  JS has its uses but some bits of it ,  you have to admit ,  are worryingly crap ,  like lack of namespacing ,  etc
-1	Ah shite ,  my first tweet of 2014 was a bloody retweet .  Hope youre proud ,   @ Potato _ jim
-1	Woop !  Half way .   ( Checked in at Scotch Corner Moto Services )  
-1	 @ BritishGasHelp I understand if youve moved resource to handle calls for the storm .  I want to know how my switch to BG is going . 
-1	 @ sahilmalik I still find fascinating that SQL best practices for SharePoint are NOT SQL best practices .  How long b4 SQL Server SP Edition ? 
-1	That  @ skype ringtone on the  @ xboxone advert really jars me ,  mentally Im scrambling for my headset when I hear it
-1	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch  @ HughAJWood But now I wish I found that first ,  thats a lot easier to read  : D
-1	Well ain that a surprise  ( genuinely )  ,  the Harry Potter books are not available on Kindle .  . 
-1	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Hey guys ,  how can I find out my tariff rates on the web based system ? 
-1	 @ fabianwilliams  @ ghurlman Can I span all three ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ d4vinder I aint got Sky Movies package  : P But I think its on Netflix anyhow
-1	 @ WahVa So if I log onto another machine with my MS acc ,  it syncs everthing thats stored ,  not just whats needed
-1	 @ SharePoint  @ joeloleson Isolated as in targeted ,  or as in accidental ? 
-1	 @ WahVa  @ googlechrome Perhaps !  And to you !   ( Canary runs fine btw ) 
-1	 @ drspouse For work I couldnt care less ,  Im not paying for the ticket  ( the main reason for my question )  . 
-1	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams SPs commonality means a disparse tech team can have something concrete to interface against I guess
-1	 @ jmikewatson  @ joeloleson  @ iOnline247 True .  But to endure the tirade of failure before you get successful can take so much out of someone
-1	 @ ghurlman Thing is with this ,  it goes from just looking photorealistic to looking really nice to look at
-1	 @ stacyDraper Why thank you !  Same to you ! 
-1	 @ MartinHatch  @ MossLover Oh ,  and congrats  : P
-1	 @ ToddKlindt Thats what Im thinking .  Mightve taken my work laptop there last year
-1	If you switch channel to a movie ,  and it immediately cuts to adverts ,  take the hint :  its probably not that great a movie
-1	Want some nostalgia ?  Crank up this 18 second beaut :  
-1	 @ stacyDraper It is .  Pure C +  +  .  All you can get out of it are the DllExports
-1	 @ stacyDraper Definitely ,  thats the most exciting part over renting . 
-1	Finally .  .  .  I think I can feel the house warming up now .  .  .  back after 2 days away and it was 12C when we got in  & gt ;  .  & lt ; 
-1	I notice theres a  @ BBCNews bulletin straight after the Queens speech .  Must be the highlights . 
-1	 @ fabianwilliams Is that a Toyota ?   ( recognise the players UI ) 
-1	 @ resing  @ bathawes You mean when did he upgrade his blog to WP ?   ;  ) 
-1	RT  @ MartinHatch can someone explain why a MSFT shop where all devs are connected to the same network would choose GIT over TFS  ? 
-1	Stuffed .  Roast was successful .  Time for Toy Story 3 then dessert .  Probably some more wine ,  too . 
-1	 @ bjartnes Nøgne  ? 
-1	MY daily disappointment now consists of scanning TV channels ,  seeing  " Keeping Up .  .  .  "  then finding out its not  " Appearances " 
-1	 @ stacyDraper Up that early on a Saturday ? 
-1	 " Can you answer this ?  "  Can I piss .  Its Hogmanay and Im enjoying a bottle of Old Putney . 
-1	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Thanks ,  I can see all your available tariffs there but nothing on the web site that says what Im currently on . 
-1	Just had a  @ skype chat with sister - in - law on Skype via their  @ XBoxOne  -  the kinect is one VERY cool bit of kit
-1	 @ bjartnes Interesting !

-1	Just came across ShareCoffee by  @ ThorstenHans  -  
-1	Upgrading laptop to Win8 . 1 .  .  .  Taking ages .  1 hour already .  .  . 
-1	So yeah ,  theres this dude in charge of Ethics in Uganda .  .  .  
-1	 @ wictor Gotta prop up the pageviews somehow ! 
-1	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams plus ,  where you position people who architect a whole solution using multiple technolgies ? 
-1	Whats 2014 like ,  my Kiwi followers ?  Also ,  put Twitter away and enjoy the night . 
-1	ProTip :  Do not use the brummy or scouse accent in a TV advert if you want credibility . 
-1	 @ steperrin I would drive as close as possible ,  possibly Luton ,  to significantly reduce the fair
-1	 @ HughAJWood lol  : P
-1	 @ speedmonkeycouk  ( until you meet someone or someone wants to overtake ) 
-1	Tonights tipple  @ whiskycraig 
-1	 @ SonicBoomSix I know right !  Found it when clearing out stuff from my parents .  I remember that gig well ! 
-1	 @ Soulsailor Central London yeah I can see ,  but Ill see how close I can drive there  ( Luton usually )  . 
-1	 @ MartinHatch  @ teknirvana Instead of one directory per branch ,  its a single directory ,  and you checkout to other branches within that dir . 
-1	Anyone reckon Capaldis  # DoctorWho is gonna be a bit like an older David Tennant ? 
-1	 @ BritishGasHelp Ive not heard anything for about two months ,  my current supplier is a tad frustrating to work with . 
-1	Merry Christmas to those celebrating !   : D A day of food n booze awaits ! 
-1	Gleðilegt nýtt ár !   # iceland

-1	 @ govindajeggy tell it .  Sitting here giggling in bed ,  thinking of different possibilities for that story
-1	Fuck me ,  youd think the world was coming to an end .  .  .  
-1	 @ SharePoint Understood  -  one last question ,  do you believe there may have been an overreaction to whats happened ? 
-1	Also ,  is there a law in the UK about being placed onto an energy tariff without asking you ?  Thats worse than mis - selling ,  surely ? 
-1	 @ wictor The ol blog wont visit itself now ,  will it ?   : P
-1	 @ pbjorklund  @ sebmatthews  @ HughAJWood I like these discussions ,  myself  : P
-1	It seems  @ AskNationwide have a habit of cancelling your card for small online payments ,  even for frequent payments
-1	10 minutes on hold to  @ BritishGas to enquire about my switch .  No answer .  Given up .  Why am I switching to them again ? 
-1	 @ stacyDraper I know of those ,  havent had a good look around them yet though

-1	 @ Potato _ jim Bruce is done by Barry Humphries  /  Dame Edna Everidge
-1	 @ sympmarc  @ joeloleson You need to be able to mute irrelevant blog posts from being autotweeted
-1	 @ stacyDraper As much as SP is supposed to be a document management tool ,  its very shit at basic stuff like moving / copying docs
-1	 @ AskNationwide All sorted now ,  frustrating experience for a second time ,  however . 
-1	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams How about just kickass at software dev in general but not as hot at JavaScript which is kinda lame anyway
-1	RT  @ NYorksPolice Reports of black ice around Blubberhouses on the  # A59  -  take care !   & lt ;  Theres a village called Blubberhouses .  Awesome !

-1	So is this the Captains Table of  # SPC14 ?  
-1	ProTip :  Do NOT go with  @ AskNationwide for your retail banking .  Most confusing experience there is on the market .

-1	Hey ,   @ BBCOne  -  that advert for The Voice 2014 is some pretty freaky sh * t .  .  . 
-1	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch the branching system ,  and ease of cloning from github is why I like git
-1	FINALLY got round to watching Deathly Hallows Pt 2 .  Pretty good ,  best photography of the lot I think .

-1	 @ joeloleson  @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247  " agility "  is the key word there .  Stand still and youre left behind .  Keep moving .  Keep learning .
