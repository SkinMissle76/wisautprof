46	Enjoying my duty free Cherry Noir Grey Goose vodka ,  courtesy of  @ AnnMarieMullen 
46	 @ AdamFaz81 I think Kidd and possibly Billy King will go by the all - star game .  Possibly a big trade too .  D - Will or Lopez . 
46	Went to see American Hustle today .  Amy Adams fans wont want to miss it .  .  . 
46	No exciting games tonight .  Havent caught a  @ trailblazers game yet but last place  @ utahjazz wont be any competition

46	 @ theleroy most of JRs gags are dying on their arse
46	Oh ,  and Philadelphia beat Sacramento .  So the win did little for the Nets prospects in the division  ( except theyre catching Boston )  . 
46	 @ therealmarkj best thing about it is I just learned the phrase knacker knocker .  Ill be using that . 
46	Two hours of free beer ,  wine and food in the hotel .  Dont mind if I do .

46	 # NBABallot Paul George
46	 @ AlexSwan82 the futures bright .  .  . 
46	 @ AdamFaz81 It looks like the Bulls are going to have to tear it all apart and start again 
46	 @ TheMediaRock youre becoming a BBC regular ! 
46	And  @ channel5 _ tv are repeating it again 15 hours later !  Presumably for the Eddie Stobart drivers who are working nights on xmas day . 
46	Or that Vernon Kay is the best person they can find to present it . 
46	 @ AnnMarieMullen thats not the official account !  Read the tweets  ;  -  )

46	 @ therealmarkj Sounds like youre having a good xmas ! 
46	 @ AdamFaz81 plenty of draft picks included .  Im guessing the Bulls wont extend Bynum after the end of the season ,  thereby freeing up some  $

46	Sounds familiar .  .  .  ‚Äú @ NetsDaily :  Nothing changed on  # Nets injury report :  D - Will ,  JET ,  AK - 47 ,  Truth all out 
46	This is going to be awesome .  
46	Brooklyn beat OKC last night .  But NY and Toronto get wins against San Antonio and Indiana .  Bizarre night in the Atlantic Division .

46	 @ AdamFaz81 much needed road win for the Nets .  Id have had a couple of quid on Joe Johnson getting the buzzer - beater if Id watched live . 
46	I didnt think this season could get much worse :  ‚Äú @ NYDNInterNets :  Billy King says Brook Lopez is out for the season‚Äù
46	How hard is it to get a grey goose around here ? 
46	 .  @ AnnMarieMullen looking happy after watching a win with the Everton fans at Mr Dennehys 
46	In New York for xmas so having xmas at home today .  Opened presents this morning ,  nearly time to get the turkey in the oven  # xmasnotxmas
46	Still no AK - 47 in todays  @ BrooklynNets line - up  :  -  ( 
46	Thats all they need ‚Äú @ NYDNInterNets :  Nets announce that Paul Pierce is out 2 - 4 weeks with a fracture in his shooting hand‚Äù
46	 @ AdamFaz81 I think they were expecting to get a decent movie out of it in the future .   " Ex - Nets player coaches team to first championship " 
46	 @ robinince do you prefer Bob ? 
46	 # NBABallot Stephen Curry
46	Still dont like these ‚Äú @ NetsDaily :  Get ready for the Christmas jersey .  
46	As if being down 66 - 42 wasnt bad enough ,  Paul Pierce got himself ejected with a flagrant foul 2 on George Hill : 
46	 @ AdamFaz81 Or just to wind up Knicks fans .  Or because Mikhail Prokhorov has more money than sense .  Pick any daft reason you like . 
46	 @ AdamFaz81 theres a fair chance .  I think one of the key players ,  Williams or Lopez ,  will be traded by Feb .  They need to make a statement
46	 @ theleroy Im only watching as Ann Marie has promised me Gemma Merner in a bikini . 
46	Getting really desperate now MT :  ‚Äú @ andy _ vasquez :  Jason Kidd says he will NOT wear a tie tomorrow .  Nets are 2 - 0 when he goes tieless . ‚Äù
46	 @ therealmarkj It .  is .  Awesome .

46	 .  @ AnnMarieMullen just treated me to tickets for the Nets - Bulls game tomorrow .  Best fianc√©e ever ! 
46	Its a bit chilly for that !  
46	 @ therealmarkj Theyre the midday tip - off against the Bulls .  When they planned the schedule both teams looked like contenders ,  not any more ! 
46	 @ theleroy  @ therealmarkj Is my twitter app acting up or has Swanny done a runner ? 
46	Will the  @ BrooklynNets make a play for Omer Asik now ?
