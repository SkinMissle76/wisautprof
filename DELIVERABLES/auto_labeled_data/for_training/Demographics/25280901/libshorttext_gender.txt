1	Considering my angry face en route to work this morning ,  today’s not working out too shabby 😊
1	Here’s a random thing .  Got a  # groupon voucher ,  2 nights in  # liverpool ,  plus one dinner and one breakfast  # forsale .  Cost £110 .  Any offers ? 
1	Confession :  I am marginally obsessed with Danny Dyer .   I can’t help skipping into the accent… .  😍  # eastenders
1	Lookin forward to a lovely day hangin’ with Pappa Coops for some DIY action .  I think the DIY canvases his desire to pop round for a gossip . 
1	Aaaah ,  Monday Club with the family tonight .  Deeliiish dinner and gossips .  Minus Christmas decs though ,  badtimes !  😞
1	8am start tomorrow as we cruise up to  # halifax for  # worktimes .  Does that classify as proper ‘in the north ? ’ Prepping accent in anticipation . 
1	Coming home after a  few wines ,  faced with the duty of finishing writing a feature is either a stroke of genius or absolute disaster… . 
1	So ,  was there like mega rain and wind last night or did I just imagine it ?  Utterly crap nights sleep  :  ( 
1	These have taken me a little by surprise today .  Whoever thought of filling pretzels with pillows of… 
1	First Christmas dinner of the year conquered .  All in the name of restaurant reviewing ,  you…

1	So twitter helpers ,  is anyone au fait with the use of umbrella companies ?  I am confused… .   # tax  # income
1	Magazine is done !   * actions lap of victory round the office *  👍
1	Phew !  My  # berkhamsted faves  # rumbles have made me last day utterly delightful with their redeemed fish… 
1	 @ SamDiss randomly came across this ,  but currently am editor of trade mag and freelance restaurant reviewer .  Would love to find out more  :  ) 
1	 @ HannahPeddar I used to work for a trade magazine called Tableware International .  Was too swish and not pun filled ,  wouldn’t have worked !

1	The entire population of  # dunstable ,  including some very scrummy men ,  made it to  @ CostaCoffee this morning .  Where have you all been hiding ?  ! 
1	Just seen an email entitled ‘Walking in a onesie wonderland’ .  Genuinely gutted I didn’t come up with that one…
1	Theres a girl sitting here as Im about to have dinner sitting here in flip flops .  In actual November .  As sparkly as they are ,  I’m outraged . 
1	Feeling surprisingly un - festive this year ,  that was until  @ BBCRadio2 rocked out ‘Last Christmas’ this morning ,  my fave festive choon ! 
1	Super indulgent afternoon bath .  Lush bath bomb ,  candles ,  and some magic fm choonage .  I am not… 
1	 @ catgill nope ,  just working here under a freelance contract so have to handle my own tax shindigs .   :  ( 
1	 @ Mandmegmc I actually love this ! 
1	I have decided I very much need to go to Lapland .  Are children and  /  or smug happy other half a absolute requirement ? 
1	I LOVE a little bit of MK twinkle at Christmas !   # shopping  # exciting  @  thecentre : mk 
1	Weekend has gone too damn fast .  I have naff all too contribute to those ‘how was your weekend’ convos that will happen at 9am  :  ( 
1	I have today located the nearest  @ CostaCoffee for  # mkworktimes .  Peace is restored . 
1	Catching up on  @ chattyman .  Have come to the conclusion I just don’t ‘get’ the Robin Thicke hype .  At all . 
1	 @ adrianwalker78 spoken like a true gentleman !  Haha  :  ) 
1	First night with new Christmas tree plus cat at chez coops .  I wonder how long it will last…  # mischeviouskitten 😼
1	Lovely leaving card .  Totally the plan for Monday 😎  # newjob  # leaving  # card

1	Saw a sign for ‘Ice rink and magical Santas’s grotto’ en route to work this morning .  Very nearly diverted ,  that sounds AWESOME . 
1	My cat had been living here for nine months and still every morning ,  likes to purr and jump around on me until I wake up .  Cute habit 😽
1	Getting increasingly nervous for my first day tomorrow .  Exciting ,  but very scary !   # newjob  # freshstart
1	So I cycled to  @ ww _ uk this morning in a desperate attempt to offset the cake and yummies I ate this week .  Fail ,  1lb on . 
1	Restaurant reviewing tonight with Pappa Coops .  A nice little way to say thank you for his DIY efforts these past few weeks  :  ) 
1	 @ CostaCoffee haha !  I was bowled over regardless ,  I’m sure your arrival would have been icing on the cake !  ☺️
1	Tonight I am hanging out with one of my girls .  Sad fact is ,  she’s educating me in taxes and doing my own accounts .  I am not vorderman .   # eek
1	Despite having a massive change in routine this week ,   - 2lb off on  @ ww _ uk .  Plus I cycled here again .  Smugface .  😎

1	This week has whizzed fast .  Beyond whizzed ,  actually .  Genuinely am bemused it’s the weekend already ! 
1	People who park outside your flat and have a loud as you like phone call thorough their car speaker system .  Seriously ?  ! 
1	I’ve seen at least three people eating before they pay round the supermarket this morning .  Since when was this acceptable ?

1	Given my last tweet ,  am also very thankful to my  @ NUJofficial membership .  Helpful people to a flapping jouno type ☺️
1	Mumma and Pappa Coops are there .  The near impossible chance we’ll spot them is the only reason I’m humouring this  # EnglandvChile
1	My absolutely woeful Saturday night in .  Caning the oranges and h20 like theres no tomorrow .  I hate , …
