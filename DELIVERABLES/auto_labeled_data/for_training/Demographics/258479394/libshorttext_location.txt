6	Film Review  -  American Hustle 
6	All I want is  # Resogun on Xbox One .  How about it ,   @ Housemarque ?   # FalseHope
6	 @ alex _ wakeford Get the fuck on Facebook chat right now .   # Sherlock

6	 @ LizzieWilson94 Thank you !   : D
6	The Nerd Network  -  Top 10 Best Films of 2013 
6	Now to dive straight into my Top 10 Most Anticipated Films of 2014 article .  .  .  Not sure if Im going to get it done in time for Jan 1st . 
6	Finally finished my Top 10 Films of 2013 article !  Im planning to put it up on

6	Been working on a LOT of content for 
6	Vast and Mysterious :  The Depths of Capyâ€™s  # Below  |  Pxlbyte 
6	Played a bit of  # Resogun today .  Had an absolute blast .  Awesome visuals ,  soundtrack and super addictive .  Almost enough to make me buy a  # PS4 . 
6	 @ AbKi Knights of the Old Republic 3 made by BioWare ,  or Republic Commando 2 made by DICE .  Funny how many people want Star Wars games .  .  . 
6	I really hope that  # Arrow has a season based on  @ JeffLemires run on the Green Arrow comics .  My favourite DC book right now ,  by far . 
6	 @ josejonesfilms Maybe RWBY Episode 8 .  .  .  or the Moonbase Alpha Lets Play .  .  . 
6	 @ briannemd WTF I POSTED THAT IN THE GROUPME .  Also ,  okay . 
6	Looking in that tag reminded me why I try to watch and love the show without talking about it .  I just get angry .  So ,  no review .   # DoctorWho
6	I was going to write a review for  " The Time of the Doctor ,  "  but then I made the mistake of going in the  # DoctorWho tag on Tumblr . 
6	Its time .   # DoctorWho
6	 @ nicktuckerrr Thanks man ! 
6	Only done a few races in  # Forza5 ,  but Im already the most aggressive and reckless driver ever .  People are gonna HATE my Drivatar . 
6	 @ rebeccaedrew Thank you !  Hope youre having a lovely day too !   : D We need to meet up soon ! 
6	 @ KeeferBishop  @ rebeccaedrew Did you just call me Gayo ? 
6	 # Transistor Now in Fully Playable Internal Alpha  |  Pxlbyte 
6	Bought  # Halo :  Spartan Assault today .  Played a decent amount on Windows 8 but looking forward to getting stuck into the  # XboxOne version . 
6	What is it with the end of the year and making Top 10 lists ?  Ive made like four different ones .  .  . 
6	 @ DillonWizard Hes pushing it a bit ,  but okay for now .  Looks like they did a lot of make - up work so he looked convincingly younger . 
6	Film Review  -  The Hobbit :  The Desolation of Smaug 
6	Finally saw The Desolation of Smaug .  Wow .  Fucking WOW .  What a film .  That ending was so good .   # TheHobbit
6	Id be willing to bet that Vin Diesel is playing Thanos as well as Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy . 
6	Only four days ,   @ kefuller ! 
6	So ,  as always with  @ telltalegames ,  playing the first episode of  # TheWalkingDead :  Season 2 was a bad idea .   # crying
6	Comic Book Review  -  Alex  +  Ada  # 1 and  # 2 
6	Cant believe I didnt get all the references in  # Chuck on my first watch .  Holy shit . 
6	 @ alex _ wakeford 
6	Finally started  # DeadRising3 .  Im enjoying it a LOT more than I thought I would .  Played for a good few hours .   # XboxOne
6	So glad  # Chuck is on Netflix .  Re - watching Seasons 1 - 3 before watching ,  for the first time ,  Seasons 4 and 5 .  Id forgotten how amazing it is . 
6	 # Tomorrowland got delayed to May 2015 ?  !  When did that happen ?  ! 
6	 @ kayleighrhardy Nah . 
6	One of the best parts about coming home from uni is being able to catch up on multiple  # Saga issues .  I always forget how incredible it is . 
6	 @ ustwogames Thats fine  :  )  Thats for getting back to me !  Cant wait to play the next version of the beta ! 
6	 @ briannemd I have this problem too .  Hate it . 
6	 @ ustwogames Hi ,  Im an Editor for 
6	 @ razorrednoise Really excited for the new album !  Will it be called In Viridian 7 or something different ? 
6	 @ AlexaRayC The amount of times I died during the bit with the glider is embarrassing . 
6	I would just like to express my deepest thanks to  @ NetflixUK for finally putting up all five seasons of  # Chuck . 
6	Xbox One SmartGlass really is the shit . 
6	I think that my course will be offering a creative writing module in third year .  Hopefully that will motivate me to actually finish things . 
6	Ive got a short story thats half written ,  another thats deep into editing ,  and a comic book script thats somewhat planned out .   # writing
6	Really want to work on some creative projects over the holidays .  Its been a long time .  Need to take a good look at everything .   # writing
6	Been awake for 27 hours .  Not tired right now ,  but I know I will be .  Tomorrow is a day for sorting my life out before going home . 
6	Re - watching  # GenerationKill for the first time in a few years .  A lot better than I remember .  Love a good HBO war miniseries . 
6	 @ KWMathias I lost my campaign progress too ,  on hard .  So annoyed .  Multiplayer is so much fun but SO unstable . 
6	Interstellar seems like the kind of film Nolan should be doing  -  bold and thought - provoking .  After The Prestige and Inception ,  Im so ready . 
6	 # INTERSTELLAR TEASER TRAILER ?  !  HOLY FUCK MUST WATCH ! 
6	 @ rosstmiller I thought exactly the same thing . 
6	 @ nicktuckerrr I know City of Angels from LLF + D was at the end  -  interesting they had that song way back in 2009 .  Only released this year . 
6	 @ nicktuckerrr I think it was Kings  & amp ;  Queens .  I loved when Closer To The Edge came together as well  -  one of the first songs they finished . 
6	 @ nicktuckerrr It was fascinating to see what their process is like .  I LOVE This Is War so much so it was great to see how it came to be . 
6	 @ nicktuckerrr Indeed .  You really see how dedicated he is to the band and how much the lawsuit messed him up . 
6	Also ,  the next big young adult film franchise should be based on  @ Matthew _ Reillys Hover Car Racer .  Perfect source material right there . 
6	Id have liked to have seen a Hunger Games book / film showing Katniss and Peeta mentoring the next years Tributes ,  before Catching Fire . 
6	There are a lot of movies that Im excited for over the next few months ,  but right now ,   # AmericanHustle is right at the top of that list . 
6	 @ nicktuckerrr Its really great man .  Super interesting ,  shows a lot about the industry ,  but engages you in the bands struggle too . 
6	Web Series Review  -   # RWBY Volume 1 
6	The problem with TV for me is that I dont watch live .  By the time Ive bought boxsets  +  watched ,  its almost time for the next season .  .  . 
6	Planning to do a lot more TV reviews next year .  Full seasons instead of single episodes .  Going to start with  # Sherlock and  # HouseofCards . 
6	Film Review  -  The Hunger Games :  Catching Fire 
6	Taking a break from AC 4 to ,  finally ,  write up my Catching Fire review .  Pulling an all nighter to get stuff done / fix my sleeping pattern . 
6	 @ JakeBaldino Playing Halo 4 on Xbox One would be SWEET .  Maybe BioShock and Mass Effect collections ? 
6	Got the opportunity to be a beta tester for  # MonumentValley by  @ ustwogames .  Loving the game so far ! 
6	 @ EmbeddedUDF STOP . 
6	Pleasantly surprised by the  # EdgeofTomorrow trailer .  Looks pretty good .   # LiveDieRepeat
6	Gotta start thinking about my top 10 movies of the year ,  and my top 10 most anticipated movies of 2014 . 
6	Time Limit Removed from  # EverybodysGonetotheRapture  |  Pxlbyte 
6	Some of the opening shots in the  # Godzilla trailer look exactly like the drop sequence from Halo 3 :  ODST . 
6	 @ BrianPShea Looking forward to reading it ! 
6	I have to admit ,  the  # Lego movie looks fucking awesome . 
6	Local ads before seeing a movie are the WORST . 
6	Excited to finally see  # CatchingFire tonight .  Got loads of errands to run before then ,  though . 
6	Space Sim  # NoMansSky is Expansive and Gorgeous  |  Pxlbyte 
6	 @ ColinCampbellx Loved your article on No Mans Sky !  Made me even more excited for the game . 
6	Talking about the Gothic is just making me think of that sweet  # Thief trailer from  # VGX .  Im clearly enthralled by this lecture .  .  . 
6	Got loads of articles I want to write for Pxlbyte ,  Airlock Alpha and The Nerd Network ,  too .   # journalism
6	Looking forward to term finally ending and going home to see friends / family .  Its been a long few months . 
6	 @ PanelsAndPixels I had a lecturer last year who would make an effort to reference the works of Joss Whedon in her lectures .  It was awesome . 
6	Lecturer just used the logo from Call of Duty :  Ghosts in a lecture about the Gothic .   # thefuck ? 
6	At least I got my essay in on time .  Now to sleep ,  play video games ,  watch movies and TV ,  write articles and get drunk for the rest of life . 
6	Cant sleep .  Need to be up in two and a half hours for uni .  Why do I do this to myself ?   # balls
6	Im honestly surprised that there hasnt been a Hunger Games video game yet . 
6	The Riddles in the Dark scene really is outstanding .   # TheHobbit
6	Re - watching An Unexpected Journey to get ready for The Desolation of Smaug .  The meal scene is making me hungry .   # TheHobbit
6	 # SuperTimeForce Coming to Xbox One  |  Pxlbyte 
6	Telltale really are owning this show .  Shame the rest of it is so shit .   # VGX
6	 @ chrisveall  @ borbz _ 19 Good lad ! 
6	 @ teamzissouu HATE YOU
6	Im about 70 %  sure that  # TheDivision is going to get delayed to 2015 ,  but between  # Titanfall ,   # Watch _ Dogs and  # Destiny ,  2014 is shaping up ! 
6	These new plans for a  # Terminator reboot film and TV show sound exactly like what was planned with Salvation and Sarah Connor Chronicles .  .  . 
6	Horrendously hungover .  Should not have gone out last night .  Lost an entire day of essay writing .  Gonna be a fun weekend .  .  .   # balls
6	GODDAMN IT ,  I knew I should have written down that dream !  Cant remember it . 
6	So .  That Amazing Spider - Man 2 trailer is a thing . 
6	 @ DGoodayle Congratulations !  Looking forward to playing the game . 
6	Microsoft Announces ID @ Xbox Developer Partners  |  Pxlbyte 
6	That footage of the huge sunken WWII Japanese submarine is SO creepy . 
6	 @ kefuller Id respect you if you beat me at Halo ,  but then I know that youve been playing for as long as I have . 
6	I think I would have preferred Gina Carano ,  to be honest .   # WonderWoman
6	 @ JakeBaldino I like Gal Gadot ,  but they might as well call it Justice League now . 
6	Ive started typing so quickly that I get confused between the Ctrl and Shift keys . 
6	 @ kefuller Alien is a fantastic film ! 
6	Great to finally know the release date for  # HouseofCards Season 2 !  Feb 14th ,  2014 cant come soon enough .   # excited
6	Team Meatâ€™s  # MewGenics to Feature Item Hoarding  |  Pxlbyte 
6	Anyone know how people who pre - ordered  @ Battlefield 4 get access to  # ChinaRising on  # XboxOne ?  The store just redirects to Premium .  .  . 
6	 @ Hecktiq Really great game but some stability issues :  crashes ,  server problems and corrupted campaign saves .  As a game though ,  brilliant . 
6	 @ teamzissouu Started your essay yet ? 
6	Absolutely loved An Adventure in Space and Time .  A great drama and the perfect tribute to William Hartnell and  # DoctorWhos humble origins . 
6	My blog has a brand new look ,  courtesy of  @ TomJManningART !  Check it out at 
6	 @ thin _ white _ duke Only when hes starring AND directing in the same film . 
6	 @ chrisveall I dont have a suit so Im just wearing a shirt and a tie ,  haha . 
6	 @ chrisveall Youre going all out ,  then ? 
6	I know I say this with every Assassins Creed game ,  but I really think Black Flag could be the one where I find / do everything .   # AC4
6	 @ mikeBithell Its just as awesome as ever ,  but HARD !  I played a few games yesterday and got absolutely destroyed . 
6	So ,  seems like I lost my  # Battlefield4 campaign save .  On hard difficulty .   # ugh
6	 @ razorrednoise Really excited for IV7 !  I still have all the other IV albums on in the background when I work or relax . 
6	Not having much luck with multiplayer tonight .  EAs  # Battlefield4 servers are messed up and I keep getting destroyed on  # AC4 . 
6	Got really worried that my Kinect had broken just now .  But I reset my Xbox One and then it was fine .   # weird
6	Crossover Between  # HyperLightDrifter and  # ParadiseLost Announced  |  Pxlbyte 
6	A touchscreen laptop ?  A phone with a finger print scanner ?  A games console with awesome voice commands ?  It really is the future .   # technology
6	Addicted to  # Battlefield4 .  Reminds me of the good old days of Bad Company 2 .  Might be the most cinematic multiplayer Ive ever played . 
6	 @ JakeBaldino What games are you playing right now ,  Jake ? 
6	When I was researching this essay ,  I found a critical journal that was exactly what I need ,  but I just cant find the author .  Bugger .

6	 @ teamzissouu YES ! 
6	 # TheFlash No Longer A Backdoor  # Arrow Pilot  |  Airlock Alpha 
6	 @ kefuller Bloody hell ,  every year it comes around so quickly !   : D
6	I wonder if I could get Siri to talk to Kinect . 
6	 @ rebeccaedrew You should go back and watch the last series ! 
6	 @ Deadpxls I think its a Canadian and American thing .  It literally NEVER happens here . 
6	 @ XboxSupport Do Xbox One game updates download in the background after installing offline and then reconnecting ?  There is no progress bar .  .  . 
6	 @ rosstmiller Plan it all out ,  for sure . 
6	I never thought I would ever see people clap in a cinema ,  but thats exactly what happened after The Day of the Doctor .   # DoctorWho
6	Seeing The Day of the Doctor in the cinema soon !  Excited !   # DoctorWho  # SaveTheDay
6	 @ Hecktiq The software is rough .  Having game installation and title update problems ,  as well as apps crashing  .
