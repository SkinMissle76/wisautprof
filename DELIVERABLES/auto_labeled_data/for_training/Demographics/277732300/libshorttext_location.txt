30	 @ AnnaKennedy1  @ CarrieGrant1  @ Strideforth  @ judithhebron I asked Adam if he wanted 2 hear my speech again ,  he said no but Im guessing I will !

30	If you put effort into something just expecting something back for yourself maybe you are doing it for the wrong reasons
30	Merry Christmas everyone !  !  !  ! 
30	 @ AnnaKennedy1 fighting drills good for so much but the martial art is where u grow as a person .  Thats what training is ,  growing

30	 @ oddcog _  this must be really stressful for u ,  I hope it helps .  Just make sure when u tell anyone it is cos u want to ,  u control it
