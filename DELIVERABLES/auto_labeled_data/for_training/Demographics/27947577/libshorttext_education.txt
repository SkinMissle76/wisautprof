3	 @ glencooley bought the wife 6 months of Netflix for Christmas .  Not seen House of Cards yet ,  but its on my list .  .  . 
3	Its only January 6th and theres already a strong contender for headline of the year .  
3	Happy 15th Birthday to 
3	So ,  Ill be buying both a new Chromebook and a Sonos 1 on my upcoming US trip .  The difference in price between US and UK is still ridiculous
3	This looks brilliant .  Would be better if / when it can support chip and PIN for the UK market :  
3	Very freaky .  Reflection on double glazing made it look like my sons Kermit the Frog cushion was driving my car .  
3	 @ chilternrailway Thanks Emma .  Know its been a tough night for you .  On train from Marylebone now .  Thanks for the help . 
3	 @ m4tt Hmm .  Im thinking of it as a supplement to my iPad .  Sometimes a proper keyboard is just better and current laptop is slow ,  bulky  & amp ;  hot
3	Interesting reading about the shift to focus on design first at Microsoft 
3	 @ dylansmith Exactly .  Handset prices are coming down  & amp ;  people are more likely to want shorter term contracts .  30 day sim deals are the future
3	 @ Cennydd  @ hellofisher  @ AaronGustafson 
3	 @ dangrech That’s my point .  Focuses on company ,  not end customer experience .  With that said ,  we use them  too  ( sparingly )  .  Being idealistic . 
3	Im at Capitol Shopping Centre  -   @ capitol _ cardiff w /   @ paul _ dodd 
3	Want .  
3	Sheesh Siri ,  I give up .  I’ll just open the weather app myself .  
3	This should have been sequentially ,  not simultaneously ,  my bad .  Source :  
3	 @ gaby _ pinsharp Thanks very much for the nice feedback .  Glad you found it interesting ! 
3	 @ timehop seems so  -  thanks for the quick help ! 
3	Sounds like  @ benjrooney is having an eventful flight . 
3	 @ macnovel  @ chilternrailway thanks .  Would be good to get an officially reply from Emma before heading there …
3	My Bluetooth headphones have stopped working in one ear ,  I have to tilt my head to find the right position to hear  # firstworldproblems
3	 @ TrolliedSky1 Looks like its available On Demand now .  Just set my Sky +  box to remote record it . 
3	Yes they do ,   @ absoluteradio ,  yes they do  # captchafail 
3	 @ VodafoneUKdeals 191 were about as helpful so I requested to terminate my contract .  Way to lose a long term customer . 
3	Nice work  @ google for making QuickOffice free for all 
3	Correct ,  this is brilliant .  RT  @ cicom :  Brilliant Lords Prayer parody using station names v .  funny  # tfl  # London 
3	 @ neildodd  @ Cennydd  @ hellofisher  @ AaronGustafson Ah ,  its sequentially ,  not simultaneously .  My bad .  Still ,  makes me question mobile first . 
3	It’s screwed up that the answer to a late train is to not pick up any more passengers along the way .   @ chilternrailway 
3	 @ chilternrailway Morning !  Don’t know its name ,  but the equipment above the seats is dripping water at the back of the 0720 from BCF . 
3	Totally agree !  RT  @ rahelab  @ scottabel  @ wion  @ nozurbina But when the content at the end sucks ,  no one sits around praising the UX that tried . 
3	Someone needs to turn the bass down in  # Beaconsfield .  House shaking from noise coming from the other side of the train tracks . 
3	Just taken me 40 minutes from Marylebone to Primrose Hill on a packed bus of screaming kids on the way to the Zoo .  I’ve had better journeys . 
3	 @ m4tt Ha .  Didnt spot that  :  ) 
3	 @ scouserachel Best musical ever .  Saw it 4 times . 
3	The internet kettle ,  or iKettle :  
3	Your Friday morning starts  * right here *  people .   @  Beaconsfield 
3	 @ AaronGustafson e . g .  completing long forms is arduous task on small device ,  let me save and pick it up later on .  .  . 
3	Good morning Santa Monica .  
3	 @ VodafoneUKdeals I hoped for youve been a good customer for many years ,  so heres something a bit better than that .  GiffGaff it is then . 
3	Hmm .  Facebook app crashing on loading news feed on both iPhone and iPad .  Looks like today’s update is the cause ? 
3	 @ chilternrailway Physically unable to squeeze on one of your trains .  Absolute ridiculous farce .  35 minutes to next one .  Poor ,  poor service
3	Interesting to see  @ transportgovuk feeling a little the defensive this morning over  # HS2
3	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion  .  .  .  But there are aspects outside of your control and constant surprise and learning . 
3	Gutted to be missing  @ WayraUK event  ( wedding anniversary )  but congrats team  @ delishery on launching their beta today !  
3	Quiet news day .  MT  @ BBCBreakfast :  Long overdue library book ?  Tell us when it should have been returned and how much you think you owe . 
3	 @ FGW thanks .  On a Chiltern train now . 
3	Me and my little boy ,  6 years ago today  ( via  @ timehop )  .  Hes not a little boy anymore .  
3	 @ m4tt Good move .  Vodafone refused to even come close on pricing or terms .  Its the way the world is going though as handset prices reduce . 
3	Wow .  This is an incredible move by WH Smith .  
3	Off to day 2 of  # csauk and to my first conference presentation  * ulp *  .  Come to my session for tips on User Experience based on real examples . 
3	 @ NRE _ Chiltern Was told when I got to Marylebone ,   then tweet from CR and also just confirmed to me in a tweet from FGW .  Needed info prior . 
3	A foggy morning at Beaconsfield station .   (  @  Beaconsfield Railway Station  ( BCF )   -   @ nationalrailenq )   [ pic ]  :

3	A great critique of iOS7 buttons  ( or lack thereof )  from  @ jaredsinclair  :  
3	 @ kyndainverse mtpcon2013
3	Wow .  “ @ dgardinerr :  Best photo I’ve ever seen of  # London Thought I’d share it .  Taken by Marco Ribbe  @ TheShardLondon 
3	Good morning London 
3	 @ VodafoneUKdeals The whole point of me engaging on Twitter was to avoid spending time trying to barter with customer services  * sigh * 
3	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion its why testing is critical ,  but also what keeps working in UX fun and interesting for me . 
3	Amazons Boxing Day Deals Week starts on Christmas Day .  Well ,  that makes a whole bucketload of sense .  
3	Getting the sliced thumb looked at .   (  @  Wycombe General Hospital )  
3	Im at Servisair Lounge  ( Hillingdon ,  Middlesex )  w /  2 others 
3	 @ UrbanGoddess Thanks very much .  It was my first talk ,  so I appreciate the feedback .  Glad you found it useful . 
3	Whoop .  First trip to LA .   (  @  Los Angeles International Airport  ( LAX )   -   @ lax _ official w /  171 others )  
3	Cookie Monster on Newsnight .  Yes ,  really .  
3	Tweets from  @ HassanRouhani make really interesting reading .  Incredible openness . 
3	Brilliant insight into the evolution of Facebooks photo reporting tool from  @ domurphy at  # csauk  .  Fascinating stuff . 
3	I’ve just been invited to a ‘Tweeting in Realtime Webinar’ .  Clearly all that tweeting in the past and future is where I’ve been going wrong . 
3	A bit more context on  @ arockleys comment about people moving across devices is here :  
3	 @ ThreeUKSupport Already am . 
3	Really looking forward to the  @ MindTheProduct conference today .  Last year was amazing ,  so high hopes for this year .   # mtpcon
3	Im at Torchwood Hub w /   @ paul _ dodd  [ pic ]  :  
3	 @ glencooley Heh  :  )  Good to see I actually managed to achieve something today ! 
3	Awful to see my old hometown of Aberystwyth on the news with the old seafront torn up by the storm .  Thinking of all affected by the  # UKStorm
3	How much ?  !  
3	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion Personally ,  I work / design to  * influence *  the experience as much as I can within constraints . 
3	Timehop reminding me of what I think is my favourite photo of Adam as a baby .  6 years ago today .  
3	 @ AaronGustafson I think were arguing the same point  :  )  I just have a pet hate of the phrase mobile first and the connotations it suggests
3	On this day last year .  What an amazing day it was too .   
3	 @ think _ info  @ wion But does ‘adaptive’ = ‘put less on smaller screens’ ?  Suggests that mobile users want / need / deserve less content .  Always true ? 
3	 @ chilternrailway Hi Emma .  FGW not on ticket acceptance list ?  Can we take trains from Paddington to get a bus from Slough to Beaconsfield ? 
3	 @ AaronGustafson i . e .  mobile prioritised to the exclusion of others .  Would rather focus my time on experience first ,  or customer first . 
3	Loving todays Dilbert on closing Skype .  I remember lengthy discussions about why Quit wasnt in the menu bar .  
3	 @ AaronGustafson Not disagreeing with that .  Arguing for understanding and catering for transition points between screens / experiences , 
3	 @ danddu Other side of the tracks is all the million pound houses ,  so definitely the wrong side for me  :  ) 
3	 @ ThomsonHolidays Not yet .  Were more hop on a bus and explore kind of people ,  but will take a look . 
3	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion Pleased to  spark such debate !  I think youre all right - quite hard to express in 140 chars . 
3	 @ m4tt Quick search suggests its affecting lots of people .  I smell a story brewing  :  ) 
3	Im at  @ CadburyWorld  ( Bournville ,  West Midlands )   [ pic ]  :  
3	A 16Gb Nexus 4 for £199 is an incredible bargain .  Tempted to buy a second just for the sake of it  :  )  
3	 @ Cennydd Really enjoyed your talk .  Thanks ! 
3	 @ m4tt Im very tempted .  Why not for you ? 
3	 @ timehop Hi Timehop folks .  No Facebook photos are loading for me anymore .  It just displays a timeout error .  Known problem or just me ? 
3	 @ chilternrailway Yes .  Now going be horrendously late for work .  How can you not plan for increased summer capacity on busy trains ? 
3	Ooh .  Or should that be Whooo ?  
3	This has me giggling this morning 
3	 @ FirstChoiceUK Barceló Fuerteventura Thalasso Spa  :  ) 
3	Blimey .  8 , 000  @ foursquare checkins !

3	Foursquare adds Foursquare ads 
3	 @ Bluegrass _ BBQ Hey  -  saw news of your launch on Bucks Free Press .  Looking forward to trying it out !  Will you do a kids menu ? 
3	Dear BBC News .  What was the name of that terrorist organisation again ?   ( Screenshotted before they fix it )  .  
3	Sad to announce that after a turbulent 12 year relationship Ive left Vodafone .  Ive ported ,  unliked and unfollowed .  Its not me ,  its them . 
3	Photo doesnt really do it justice .  Thats a  * massive *  box being delivered to the roof of a house by… 
3	 @ chilternrailway Morning .  Big thanks to lady on info kiosk at Marylebone last night who helped me get a forgotten phone back to a colleague ! 
3	Brilliant .  Search for lets go caroling in Google from a mobile phone . 
3	 @ AaronGustafson  [ … ]   * and * identifying and supporting opportunities to transition between them is different to ‘mobile first’ . 
3	Time for the Stretcher Race .  !   (  @  Beaconsfield Old Town )  
3	Loving the final episode of the  # ITCrowd already .  Will miss it . 
3	Thats the wifes birthday present sorted .

3	 @ methodphoto ha ,  brilliant  :  ) 
3	Brilliant ,  brilliant work .  Someone deserves a promotion .  
3	 @ dangrech Prove youre a human shouldnt really be needed at all .  Forces each customer to takes steps to solve issues caused by minority . 
3	Nice reassuring message from driver on this train .  We’re only allowed to do 20 mph because of a ‘slight bump’ in the track . 
3	 @ VodafoneUKdeals Hi .  I’m due an upgrade ,  but have bought my own phone .  What’s your best sim only deal with at least 1GB data ? 
3	 @ RichMartell very nice !  Where’s that ? 
3	 @ NRE _ Chiltern but not First Great Western from Paddington ? 
3	Complete this sentence :  scaling the Shard will stop arctic oil drilling because .  .  .   * sigh *  Truly hope no one gets hurt . 
3	Taking Adam to his second footie match .   Come on Wycombe !   (  @  Adams Park  -   @ wwfcofficial for Chairboys vs Shrimpers )  
3	 @ NRE _ Chiltern how would that affect Paddington to slough ?  No matter now anyway ,  on a Marylebone train . 
3	 @ akscutt  @ ranh76 the guy running the cornish pasty place in Marylebone had a good night at least .  He had one pasty left when I got there . 
3	Just booked my second  @ FirstChoiceUK holiday of the year ,  to a hotel we first stayed in four years ago .  Im definitely a creature of habit . 
3	 @ FirstChoiceUK Hotel  & amp ;  area are great .  Perfect balance between plenty to do and relaxing .  Late booking so decided to go with what we know  :  ) 
3	I tried hard to like Gmails tabbed inbox ,  but switched it off as I kept missing stuff .  Seems targeted at people who dont like to read email
3	 @ dangrech no ,  but a week in the Canary Islands obviously had more impact than I thought !   :  ) 
3	Loving your work ,  fella 
3	 @ AaronGustafson  @ Cennydd  @ hellofisher appreciating that people transition  * across platforms *  is a different strategy from focus on mobile
3	 @ nozurbina  @ arockley Little bit of confusion between hardware and software here .  My old iPad 2 is still running the latest operating system . 
3	 @ Bluegrass _ BBQ Great news !  Thanks for replying .  Best of luck with the launch ! 
3	 @ Paul _ Dodd at least it feels like 27
3	90 %  of people use multiple screens simultaneously  @ Cennydd at  # mtpcon

3	 @ methodphoto what did he say ? 
3	Bringing shiny new iOS brightness to an otherwise dull morning .  Looking forward to having a play .  
3	 @ NRE _ Chiltern Theres a bus from Slough to Beaconsfield .  FGW was actually a valid alternative route but wasnt communicated by you or CR
3	 @ FGW are you accepting tickets for stranded chiltern passengers to get to slough from Paddington ? 
3	 @ dangrech Exactly
3	 @ chilternrailway Hi Chiltern Railways folks .  Hope you had a good Christmas .  Is Beaconsfield ticket office open on New Years Day please ? 
3	 @ chilternrailway Thanks for reply .  Really difficult circumstances I know ,  but none of your Comms said so until too late to be helpful . 
3	Another gem from  @ Cennydd  :  a good transition can speak a thousand drop shadows  # mtpcon
3	3 years ago today I got my new car ,  but someone else got to try it before I did .  .  .  
3	 @ glencooley Colmans every time ! 
3	 @ rahelab  @ izahoor  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ wion of course .  Not suggesting that the presentation of content is more important than accuracy . 
3	 @ AaronGustafson Yup .  eBay scan a drivers licence to register a good example too . 
3	Anniversary dinner with the family .   (  @  Prezzo  -   @ love _ prezzo )  
3	 @ rahelab  @ izahoor  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ wion But as per my bank statement example ,  no one says thats great content with bad UX around it . 
3	Not the best end to Monday .  
3	 @ AaronGustafson point I was making  ( badly )  earlier is that understanding and playing to strengths of devices and platforms  [ … ] 
3	 @ chilternrailway I presume I can claim on the charter for not being able to board and therefore being late ? 
3	 @ glencooley Interesting stuff ! 
3	Nice to be back in Aber .  First stop ,  kicking the bar .   (  @  The Prom )   [ pic ]  :  
3	I know nothings likely to happen until the US wakes up ,  but Im still expecting to see this screen a lot today .  
3	 @ ThreeUKSupport I worked it out ,  your form is broken .  Id be happy to explain how if youd like me to  -  give me an email address to send to . 
3	 @ ironfroggy Ha !   :  ) 
3	Interesting idea ,  I can definitely see the merits .  Replace user stories with job stories 
3	Thanks for the free fruit  @ chilternrailway .   What was that all about ?   :  ) 
3	Interesting news !  “ @ mickbirch :  We just bought Bebo back for  $ 1m .  Can we actually re - invent it ?  Who knows ,  but it will be fun trying .  .  . ”

3	 @ urban _ chronotis looked like that from a few angles !  Put a second pic up on Facebook . 
3	 @ chilternrailway It may have just been condensation ,  it had stopped by the time we got to Gerrards Cross . 
3	Doh .  Only 7 out of 10 on Name That Blue .

3	With everything going on today ,  you could miss this :  McDonalds said it was unable to serve customers on horseback .  
3	 @ chilternrailway it’s only a light drip ,  so probably nothing to worry about ,  but you might want to get it checked . 
3	Wondered what they were !  “ @ ebaymtp :  eBay colored chocolates !   # mtpcon  ( you could tell right ?  )
