3	 @ adamchapman Its  # PardewOut mate .  All his fault apparently .  Were only six points off the CL spots . 
3	 @ Matt _ Rant players need to carry the can for that .  Switched off at 1 - 0 by the sound of it .

3	 @ FingerOfBungle Steven Taylor will be wondering when his Twitter feed has went quiet . 
3	 @ dantyte almost makes Xisco look like good deal .

3	LOCK DOWN LADS !   "  @ pipogypopotamus :  THERES FUCKING ROMANIANS AND BULGARIANS EVERYWHERE .  WERE BEING FUCKING INVADED !  "

3	 @ eastcoastuk howay man ,  this is ludicrous .  After two hours I get to the Journey Details page and get an error . 
3	Great deck from  @ dancall .  10 trends to watch out for in 2014  -

3	 @ adamf2384 the fans ruin it . 
3	 @ JamieSmiff  @ adamchapman  @ OnlineRule or tweet  " GET JUNIOR ON !  !  !  "  every five bloody minutes . 
3	Id point to this as an example of bad  # PR ,  but then this is the  # BNP  -  
3	Mike Williamson is one of the few Premier League centre backs who can handle Luis Suarez  # GetMikeToManaus
3	What a  # darts match this is by the way !  Smith and Wright at the top of their games . 
3	 @ JF _ 247 not really .  Under Allardyce we were in danger of being dragged into a relegation battle ,  this year were 6 points off fourth . 
3	 @ geordiedentist  @ NUFCThreatLevel Norwich turned down our £20 ticket offer but have agreed to others .  They know they can fleece our fans . 
3	I dont know much about  # NFL but THAT was a cracking game .  Great entertainment . 
3	 @ leazeslad we were top of the league 12 years ago tomorrow . 
3	 @ lukeymoore I want high averages and everyone who sings that Yaya / Kolo Toure song put to death .  Too much to ask ? 
3	 @ JordanStiva  @ toonlowdown couldnt cope with the gameplan .  Krul  -  & gt ;  Shola  -  & gt ;  Demba  -  & gt ;  Goal  # PardewThat
3	Disappointed to lose but a canny performance from  # nufc .  Add a player or two in Jan and well be top 6 .
