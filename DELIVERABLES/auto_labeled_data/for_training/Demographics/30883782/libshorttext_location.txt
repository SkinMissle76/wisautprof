33	Amazons tax arrangements are nothing short of a work of art .  Bravo !   |  Comment is free  |  The Observer  
33	Falsetto Dracula  # eurovision
33	 @ alexhern Not really .  Another sovereign state setting their tax rate and winning at competition .  It’s UKGov that are making avoidance doable
33	 @ alexmuller first a train ,  now this !  Skydiving next ? 
33	That flaming dress used up  # eurovision’s colour budget for the year
33	 @ SW _ Trains Do you know when the next London - bound train from Oxshott will be ?  Board said 1631 on time but no show .

33	Walked 8 miles while listening to The Economist and still less than 2 / 3 through .  Won’t finish it .  A good Sunday . 
33	Electrical explosion under street right outside Starbucks I’m in .  Huge bang and all lights go out . 
33	 @ alexforey Don’t know it .  Looks nice though . 
33	 @ alexforey I can actually imagine this going down very well on a club cheese floor  # eurovision  # finland
33	First morning of travel chaos .  Sardines on train as  @ sw _ trains thought another line needed one train set more and now seemingly no 521 . 
33	That too frequent dilemma between making the train without a ticket or waiting 30 mins but paying .  SWT should probably make that better . 
33	 @ MartinPong The inevitable collections panic / nightmare ? 
33	 @ benjaminfgray She previewed it on Graham Norton a few weeks ago .  Unfortunately not a shock
33	 @ amos _ jackson In law ,  an objective test is the reasonable man ,  or the man on the Clapham Omnibus  ( seriously )  ,  test

33	 @ zethraeus Sounds good ! 
33	Schneier on Security :  Our Internet Surveillance State 
33	 @ MartinPong Haha they get worse every year . 
33	Disproportionately excited for the inevitably awful  # EUROVISION .  Already enjoying Graham’s commentary . 
33	 @ Badgerbarrett haha sure .  It’s my first so you’re brave ! 
33	 @ SW _ Trains Ok .  Are we talking 30 mins ,  an hour ,  two ? 
33	 @ zethraeus Sorry then .  You said TLDR .  Then I’m small c conservative too ,  I guess .  Unsurprised .  Those were my concerns .  Gulags least so . 
33	Recommend you read  @ alexforeys letter to his MP about the filtering proposals .  Very strong 
33	Local workmen appear .  One from gas board did impromptu gas check .  Impressive . 
33	The Great British Bake Off :  why did our show attract so much vitriol ?  
33	 @ alexmuller literally thousands of wasted keystrokes not knowing that . 
33	Well at least Cascada is getting the party going  # eurovision  # germany
33	Boris could be shown eating a puffin and it would be good press ,  Osbourne is ridiculed for a hamburger from the wrong restaurant
33	Have been enjoying  @ ThreeUK’s europass but them turning off everyone’s international roaming for a weekend is annoying
33	If there is such a thing as perfect timing for data privacy revelations ,  the day before  @ openrightsgroup  # ORGCon is probably it . 
33	From a layman’s perspective ,  Rageh Omar’s programmes on Turkey and the Ottomans on BBC have been very good . 
33	 @ alexforey That piece is so poorly thought out .  It’s like smoking in a restaurant .  X’s ancillary pleasure is decreasing Y’s primary . 
33	Everton FC .  Roberto’s blue army .  
33	Well this is different  # woodruff  # eurovision
33	 @ zethraeus read it .  That’s not what it says .

33	 # greece effortlessly slip into first place  # eurovision
33	 @ amos _ jackson I thought the first season was a bit average but this season is excellent . 
33	Five hours chasing a server PHP config error that it turns out I created in the first place years ago .  Probably a lesson there…
33	The whole  @ bbcqt audience just hit Good Energy’s site and took it down . 
33	The Economist :  The strange rebirth of liberal England  & lt ;  Interesting and quite encouraging if true  
33	 @ ThomasRichard14 Great news .  Well done ,  Elliot !

33	Should add that  @ ThePreatures were great .  Go listen to them . 
33	 @ alexhern I agree that aspect is getting multilateral change but there’s a lot we could do here first .   @ TMT _ Lawyer wrote a good piece
33	 @ coffeemadman Let it take you .  You won’t regret it . 
33	Gave some time ,  stolen from revision ,  to The Perks of being a Wallflower .  Uncomfortable at times ,  but liked it .  Painful twist near the end .

33	Match day in Norwich  # coyb
33	 @ coffeemadman Season 2 was a good one .  Haha one definitely has to keep paying attention .  The storyline is brilliant . 
33	 @ alexhern well it’s not really Ireland’s law that are problem .  We define place of establishment in our law that permits this . 
33	 @ alexhern  +  trying to solve by complaining at Ireland probs as effective as trying to make Google pay by saying it’s unfair of them not to . 
33	 @ mrchrisaddison  @ bbceurovision Μαδηεςς ?  It’s ΣΠΑΡΤΑ !  ! 
33	Saw Fleetwood Mac live tonight at the O2 .  Brilliant fun and something I never thought I’d get to see . 
33	 @ ColinRicho18 look like you’re loving life .  Enjoy ! 
33	Installing BBM on iPhone .  If anyone still lives in 2007 I’ll have a PIN soon so that’ll be a thing . 
33	 @ zethraeus p2  -  flippancy ,  p3 & amp ; 6  -  engagement ,  p7  -  voting is good ,  p8  -  dangerous style ,  p10  -  gulags
33	 @ alexmuller What was the event ? 
33	MT “ @ 1755Dictionary :  Ebriety  ( n .  )  Drunkenness ;  intoxication by strong liquors . ”  & lt ;  always wondered what the antonym of sobriety was . 
33	 @ samparkercouk it’s ‘how do you do ? ’ for the 21st century . 
33	£10 each off Ardbeg and Dalmore in waitrose because they’re end of life .  Bargain ! 
33	 @ alexhern don’t favour co vilification for 2 reasons 1 :  let’s Gov get away with not making effective law  & amp ;  2 :  risks UK certainty of position
33	 @ JontySteinfeld Spritz ?  Can’t say I’m a fan… Enjoy the sun though ! 
33	Monday .  That damp ,  grey ,  winter half - light we British simultaneously find oppressive and soothing .  Coffee and law .  Groundhog week rebegins . 
33	 @ ThomasRichard14 Boo !  Its always excellent entertainment for all the wrong reasons .  Miss Terry getting trashed though ! 
33	Silk Road :  suspicions grow that server was hacked ahead of arrests 
33	If my rate of battery life consumption is indicative ,  my iPhone and iPad tire as rapidly as I do in this heat…
33	 @ flamsmark perhaps they’re 500ml .  I found the opposite in Europe .  They used 568ml glasses but only filled to 500ml .  Always felt cheated
33	Now fire brigade have appeared .  Frankly impressive response .  Feeling safer ,  if somewhat shaken ,  in London . 
33	Those petals in a box had a feel of the crystal maze about them  # eurovision
33	The cat never moves more swiftly or silently than when mounting the kitchen unit to take a bite of my lunch whilst my back is turned .  Never . 
33	 @ alexmuller Good thing we didn’t do that then ! 
33	Wish I’d waited before fb spat re Brand’s piece .  All I wanted to say is here ;  funnier  & amp ;  smarter than I could manage 
33	Like  @ timmontgomerie’s Borgen - esque new UK pol parties in Times .  Too much compromise to vote for any current .  None sufficiently represent me
33	Home after my first exam to discover that the crucial home plug next to the router has decided to stop connecting to the others .  Unhappy . 
33	 @ benjaminfgray You might very well say that
33	 @ Badgerbarrett can’t get on because of Playstation !  !  White Collar is a great series though .  A bit like a slightly weak American Hustle . 
33	Wonder how much of a past fare rise went on installing a network of smart card pedestals ,  only to cover them all up . 
33	Tax - Free Radicals from  @ nsfwcorp .  Well worth a read 
33	 @ Badgerbarrett Got to feed it with two months of brandy !  ! 
33	 @ alexmuller Interesting to see how they manage that .  Still considering my scattergun SAR approach .  .  . 
33	The interviews that appear on R4’s Midweek are so good .  People I’d ever come across otherwise .
