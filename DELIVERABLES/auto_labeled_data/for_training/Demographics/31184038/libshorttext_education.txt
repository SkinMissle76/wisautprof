3	 @ mr _ andy _ c dont think so .  Even if that were the case ,  students are notoriously bad at voting .   @ jruddy99
3	 @ IsaacDuffy1998 yeah .  Youre a baby gay .  Youve got ages yet .   @ harry _ chitty
3	 @ GarethAlteran I wanted to read something like that . 
3	 @ s8mb Yeah ,  I think some people just dont like to acknowledge certain things .  The equivalence makes them too uncomfortable to engage . 
3	 @ zanchent FINE .  DONT CLAIM YOUR PRIZE . 
3	 @ TimSwinyard Women face different ,  additional challenges in politics .  Ive heard  " wed be more likely to win if we selected a man "  . 
3	 @ doxievee Since I manage not to fuck absolutely every guy I see ,  Id say I exercise a lot of control .   @ scyrene
3	 @ jcbernthal Clearly ,  I have brought with me a wind of change .   @ stratosphear
3	 @ Mancman10 IIRC ,  yes .  The election is going to be about how the cuts are distributed .   @ timfarron
3	 @ timfarron I know .  Its comforting but this isnt a new problem .  Not aimed at our party in gov .   @ HulbertMathew  @ Lindylooz  @ SimonHughesMP
3	 @  _ LewisMann I dont see why all four cant be false ? 
3	 @ AdamBienkov Normans a very likeable person .  It bodes well for a would - be leader .   @ jamesgraham
3	 @ Mad _ Pieman  .  . to Walmart are different ,  yes .  I feel more sorry for the latter .   @ zanchent
3	 @ scyrene Do you even know Ilford ?  !   @ GreenBenali
3	 @ Francislunn The problem with that policy is what it doesnt say rather than what it does . 
3	 @ Hostispublicus Ah ,  really ?  Thats a shame . 
3	 @ Hostispublicus 
3	 @ stackee OH FFS . 
3	 @ DamnStatists Oh god .  This is why people hate politicians . 
3	 @ ryanpowerRP Theyre against all that is good . 
3	 @ blueliberal1 True .  On that reckoning ,  Im also in favour of Natalie Bennett on the debates .  Otherwise it makes little sense . 
3	 @ Birdyword Its a fair point .  An obvious no ,  however . 
3	 @ harry _ chitty In that theyre disappointing ?   @ zanchent
3	 @ andrewdavidlong Must only be TOCs cos leases are listed separately .   @ jacquep
3	 @ ryanpowerRP Yes ,  the idea of open borders is entirely appealing . 
3	 @ ChrisjCart Im not ungrateful though .  MBE ,  OBE ,  elevation to the Lords .  .  .  .  maybe even Pride of Britain ,  or at a push ,  freedom of the city . 
3	 @ doxievee I dont see the problem . 
3	 @ ashleytmason Why is he a cunt ?  He sees that meat is murder ,  dairy is rape .  His conclusions are fine from train of thought . 
3	 @ ryanpowerRP Ill tweet you the article in due course !   @ TimSwinyard
3	 @ HuskieWalleyes Is there a difference ?  I think words used depend on whether you think it good or not .   @ HulbertMathew  @ JHoosphe  @ GreenBenali
3	 @ jcbernthal It is ?  It was full of OAPs .  .  .   @ stratosphear
3	 @ LukeBozier Families and polyamory arent mutually exclusive concepts though .   @ GarethAlteran
3	I really wish Pride of Britain next door would stop screeching like a banshee . 
3	 @ r _  _ d _   :  ( 
3	 @ ReachEd The thing is other MPs have voted for and spoken in favour of measures I find unpalatable ,  without 1 / 10 of hate .   @ JoshDixonTweets
3	 @ MylesFlaherty er
3	 @ JamesMcr90 You babe .  Someone has to do it .   @ johnlinford
3	 @ doxievee Explain it . 
3	 @ scyrene Its more that controlling Network Rail spending / wages has been difficult and more infrastructure projects started . 
3	 @ michaelcarre I only ever talk the big issues
3	 @ doxievee Dont see the immortality or filth . 
3	 @ ChrisjCart Me and you definitely deserve MBEs . 
3	 @ harry _ chitty Shes been left outside alone . 
3	 @ mattBZA WoollyMindedLib  :  ) 
3	 @ matthewcarson Are you scared ?  I know most people are . 
3	 @ s8mb Little different to making fun of their gender or race on that front . 
3	 @ jcbernthal Now ,  people do do that .  Awful ,  awful people .   @ stratosphear
3	 @ zanchent Ive also got you a password to a  $ 10k sweepstake .  I have to be all three . 
3	 @ TimSwinyard Well .  .  .  okay .  So you find the causes are not being able to go for targets cos of children ,  the famous second shift ,  perceived
3	 @ HuskieWalleyes So the emergence of a class is somewhat inevitable ,  I have always thought .   @ HulbertMathew  @ JHoosphe  @ GreenBenali
3	 @ HuskieWalleyes So close xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
3	 @ Kerri _ Prince I cant think of a more false statement than 2 tbh . 
3	 @ andreimuri I tried by size first for a few months but realised I couldnt find anything . 
3	Im at Hollywood Cinema for Frozen  ( Great Yarmouth )  
3	 @ scyrene But Wes aint standing in the 1959 general election so  @ GreenBenali
3	 @ RollsUK howd that happen ?  ! 
3	 @ beckylindeman I love buses that I feel are just for me .  .  .  eight seats though ? 
3	 @ wjharte That was good .   @ michaelcarre  @ AAEmmerson
3	 @ zanchent This is basically an invite for people asking :   " which one am I ?  !  "  You know that ,  right ? 
3	Any other  # RHOA fans online ? 
3	I join the world of people with books alphabetically arranged by author .  
3	 @  _ Kafkaesque They usually go hand - in - hand
3	 @ GingerbredDan Even if they do rape someone from lack of control ,  its still an explanation rather than a justification . 
3	 @ JamesB711 Well ,  yeah ,  but generally speaking ,  basing an argument on anecdotes isnt a good place to start . 
3	 @ stratosphear Thats just ageist ,  cupcake .   @ jcbernthal
3	 @ m4tthewleather _  Well ,  you cant really tell if its a marriage or a civil partnership from looking . 
3	 @ AbBrightman Welcome to being queer .  Just wait until youre older and gaycest becomes a problem .   @ AAEmmerson  @ stackee
3	 @ dominic _ cc Doesnt it weaken your hand in negotiation ?  Surely ,  red lines will be drawn during the process . 
3	 @  _ Kafkaesque Im just not sure what it meant ,  really .  .  . 
3	 @ GreenBenali Streeting ?   @ scyrene
3	 @ s8mb Why so ? 
3	 @ TimSwinyard sexism within a party .  .  .  and now what ?  Why do you assume women themselves havent considered why they have a harder time ?  ! 
3	 @ Stevium Women doctors are breaking A & amp ; E  :  )  Sorry but Im feminist ,  not sexist xxx
3	 @ MrWineTime Do you hate Kenya too ? 
3	My Top 3  # lastfm Artists :  Yvonne Fair  ( 27 )  ,  Nicki Minaj  ( 17 )   & amp ;  Courtney Love  ( 14 )   # lastfm 
3	 @ HulbertMathew Agreed .  Not even mitigated by terrible mental health services .   @ timfarron  @ Lindylooz  @ BBCNews  @ SimonHughesMP
3	 @ IsaacDuffy1998 dont think nice started getting sharp until I was like 18 .   @ harry _ chitty
3	 @ Hostispublicus Yeah ,  I Googled and it said there was but apparently ,  all the parties last like ten minutes . 
3	If my life were a film ,  itd be a raucous comedy starring Cameron Diaz .  What about yours ?  
3	 @ GingerbredDan Yes  -  and thats disturbing . 
3	 @ GingerbredDan Its gross but evolutionary psychologists might say that some people do  -  but then lock these people up . 
3	 @ Scullybones025 The oddest thing is that you have to be unemployed seven days before you can even claim .  I have always found that odd . 
3	 @ TimSwinyard Well ,  yes ,  but what has this got to do with Politics ?   ( I am glad someone does this work ,  btw ,  massively important .  ) 
3	 @ UnionArbeiter The truth is you put money above justice .  Youre not so different to the Tories . 
3	 @ UnionArbeiter I also cant believe you asked  " why are convicted criminals allowed to appeal ?  "  Surely that one answers itself . 
3	 @ John _ J _ C _ Moss Indeed .  Not sure why no DSS is a thing for this reason .   @ SamSussex  @ glasterlaw1  @ dewderino  @ ostercywriter
3	 @ chrisf91 My timeline is probably not the best for the conservative - minded .   @ Mister _ Snoops
3	 @ Mad _ Pieman Does it really ?  Uniformly ?  The person who freely sells their sex ,  and the person who reluctantly sells their labour .  .   @ zanchent
3	 @ stratosphear dont tell UKIP that .  .  . 
3	 @ jaay89 Go to a ticket office and ask to upgrade .  Supplement will always be different probably . 
3	 @ ryanpowerRP The British are hypocrites .  Thats not a new one for 2014  : P
3	 @ r _  _ d _  Kenya .  HOW ANNOYING . 
3	 @ scyrene Im afraid not .  This is something Boris Johnson has discussed  -  of all people .  Tax - deductible rail travel . 
3	 @ Hostispublicus Isnt it basically an independent state ?   @ scottishliberal
3	 @ DamaineGorman I hate honestly forgotten she existed until you tweeted her name . 
3	 @ scyrene LONDON borough of Redbridge  : P  @ GreenBenali
3	 @ ReachEd I didnt mean to imply you were .  I meant more that years of good work and she has been reduced to just this .   @ JoshDixonTweets
3	Im still not sure guy with two penises is real .  It sounds too much like a dream come true .  
3	 @ harry _ chitty explain please
3	 @  _ Kafkaesque I read that as Bieber .  So confused . 
3	 @ MrGees23 Aww ,  it gets better .  Well ,  your gaydar but all the rest of it too .  Mine used to be awful too . 
3	 @ stratosphear idk where youve been ,  hun .  I wouldnt know . 
3	 @ UnionArbeiter Um ,  how are they supposed to get around ? 
3	 @ stratosphear Shut it .   @ jcbernthal doesnt care and youre boring him . 
3	 @ r _  _ d _  I like to think Im Kandi but Im probably Kim
3	Some people are so thirsty it makes me want to die . 
3	 @ Stevium My fave part is when he admits that women tend to outperform men and still get paid less .  He doesnt turn a hair .  Progressive xxxxx
3	 @ HuskieWalleyes Id say people consider both .  Truth is usually oddballs who go into politics anyway .   @ HulbertMathew  @ JHoosphe  @ GreenBenali
3	Im at The Troll Cart  ( Wetherspoon )   ( Great Yarmouth ,  Norfolk )  
3	 @ stratosphear Pfft .   @ jcbernthal
3	 @ Popher Aww
3	 @ blueliberal1 Theyre more likely to have Parliamentary representation however .  Why  %  - age ? 
3	 @ DShappers I think its good that shes doing her digging so I think youre out of line .  I dont think theres much substance to it . 
3	 @ harry _ chitty but what is tactical favouriting ?  ! 
3	 " £12 , 000  -  £35 , 000 per annum " Hmm . 
3	 @ DShappers She has been proved wrong ,  in my opinion ,  now leave the woman the fuck alone . 
3	 @ jaay89 I upgraded for £1 once .  Massive treat . 
3	 @ fionayamamoto LMAO
3	 @ TimSwinyard thats an odd qualifier .  Prejudice is not legitimise or delegitimised based on source surely ?   @ ryanpowerRP
3	 @ GingerbredDan I partially agree .  Imo ,  lot of it is power lust ,  but some is entitlement ,  privilege ,  etc .  LOTS of fucked up reasons to rape . 
3	 @ jaay89 sometimes its a couple of quid .  Sometimes .  .  .  .  more .  Might as well ask . 
3	Do you know what my wish for 2014 is ?  That people stop proclaiming that they are not sexist / homophobic / racist ,  etc .  before they say shit . 
3	 @ GreenBenali I used to live in Ilford .  ILFORD CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS .   @ scyrene
3	 @ beckylindeman What a treat for you .  Thats like this fucking dirty bus that drives around empty .  Amazing . 
3	 @ Mancman10 what is the point of JSA if claimants arent supposed to live on it between jobs ?   @ BBCPropaganda
3	 @ Tara _ Hewitt Youre right ,  of course ,  but the problem is he got there easier ,  like  @ Mancman10 said .   @ MPudney  @ GABaines  @ PrettyTory
3	 @ JamesMcr90 I dont think Ive ever been so drunk that Ive taken leave of my senses in THAT sense .   @ johnlinford
3	 @ s8mb Let me be clear ,  I am not defending being intolerant of peoples sexual preferences  ( obviously )  . 
3	Fun fact :  saying youre not sexist but women doctors are a problem ?  STILL SEXIST  : D
3	 @  _ Kafkaesque Hed thank Jesus and God in his Parliamentary speeches . 
3	 @ jihouka I love that this person is a mindreader .  I bet no - one thinks about sex reassignment surgery .  They just do it on a whim . 
3	 @ DamnStatists Werent she the one who got the debate started on  " search engines blocking porn "  or some such rubbish ? 
3	 @ Emmett _ Jenner Hes a politician .   @ Garethshanks and  @ OllyNeville arent .  Why are you defending someone too stupid to shut up ? 
3	 @ s8mb Hmm .  .  I think a lot of people consider someones sexuality to be more innate than a sexual preference . 
3	 @ harry _ chitty Haha ,  loves it .  I saw her on a show once and she seems SO dumb but she consistently brought out banging songs . 
3	 @ DShappers Digging is okay  -  but she should remember the target is the policy but making it personal undermines her own case . 
3	 @  _ Lilykins Just of everyone I know who has experience with GICs ,  private ones are less triggering and inclusive . 
3	 @ harry _ chitty I think I read the same one .  I dont remember whether it was refutable but ,  in my experience ,  it seems hard to deny . 
3	 " Experience is essential "   :  )   :  )   :  ) 
3	 @ CarlStark Awwwww
3	 @  _ Lilykins You dont get that with private doctors .  If only they were more involved with Gender Identity clinics  ;  -  ) 
3	 @ ReachEd Its fair ,  yeah .  People discounting her totally off the back of it is disproportionate in my view .   @ JoshDixonTweets
3	 @ Stevium Feminists dont use phrases like  " ultra - politically correct "   :  | 
3	 @ AndyM _ D It was better than any of the alternatives in 2010  :  )  simple . 
3	 @ rastamiller I always thought he was hot but maybe he doesnt photograph as well as he films . 
3	 @ Hostispublicus Afaik ,  you are allowed to hold membership of sister parties .  I am not entirely sure of that  ( or what there is in jersey ) 
3	 @ doxievee Really ? 
3	 @ jihouka The fuck is this nonsense . 
3	 @ UnionArbeiter I have never come across a singe instance of any government being tough on victims .  Plucked straight from Daily Mail pages . 
3	 @ AAEmmerson LMFAO omg and yeah ,  sleeping together by proxy .  Love how thats a real problem for gay people .   @ AbBrightman  @ stackee
3	 @ SamSussex That is not fact .   * I *  think it is but similarly ,  it is your freedom to do what you like .   @ dewderino  @ John _ J _ C _ Moss
3	 @ TimSwinyard Yeah ,  but youre preaching to the converted here .  You dont need to tell me these people arent enlightened . 
3	 @ matthewcarson Aww ,  thats so cute . 
3	 @ RollsUK Omg that is AWFUL .  What the fuck . 
3	 @ LukeBozier True .  Dont dispute your point just not sure it differs from  @ GarethAlteran really . 
3	Actually feel bad for Kenya  # RHOA
3	 @ michaelcarre But also ,  if all parties have red lines ,  you essentially havve no leverage  -  like ,  no - one does .   @ dominic _ cc
3	 @ r _  _ d _  whats wrong with Kandi ?  ! 
3	 @ Mister _ Snoops Yeah .  Apparently ,  hes in a relationship with a couple .  At least two penises wasnt wasted on a prude . 
3	 @ s8mb Oh okay ,  I just wanted to be clear .  Yeah ,  I am not too sure if theyre similar .  I think kinks etc .  are a lot more fluid . 
3	 @ GingerbredDan Too many people trying to find ways out for rapists ,  hence ALL the normal bullshit excuses NOW plus this . 
3	 @ CarlStark Thats really sweet . 
3	 @ TimSwinyard unfortunately ,  the DMs circulation has not reached such levels .   @ ryanpowerRP
3	 @ BetterThanToday Yes .  Twerk breaks got me through one essay I almost didnt do . 
3	 @ mattBZA I do .  .  .  and I do not know . 
3	 @ ryanpowerRP normal day for him .  Why stop at threesomes ,  he thinks to himself .   @ Mister _ Snoops
3	 @ UnionArbeiter Not all appeals are heard anyway .  You show a shocking disregard for due process . 
3	Denying the existence of gaydar erases decades of gay culture .  I dont think the existence of gaydar is sexist or reinforces stereotypes . 
3	Fun fact :  saying youre not a homophobe before detailing a number of equal rights LGBT +  people shouldnt have ?  STILL A HOMOPHOBE  : D
3	Fun fact :  saying youre not racist but preferring Christian refugees ?  STILL RACIST  : D
3	Does anyone else think Angel Haze raps like the female Eminem ? 
3	 @ Tara _ Hewitt I didnt enter politics to resign myself to things .  I didnt think you did either .   @ Mancman10  @ MPudney  @ GABaines  @ PrettyTory
3	 @ stratosphear Same x
3	 @ Mister _ Snoops Id be following her if I knew where I was going .   @ chrisf91
3	 @ ReachEd Teather has slayed consistently on immigration and asylum .   @ JoshDixonTweets
3	 @ MrWineTime They must all be off - screen .   :  - P
3	 @ scyrene Er ,  yeah  : P  @ GreenBenali
3	 @ DamnStatists They are so annoying . 
3	 @ jason _ manc omg shes a joker ,   @ CraftyCraig
3	 @ Hostispublicus I think you can renew .  . 
3	 @ Arkyetc Not applying for the role but it amused me .  Who would pay a Sales Executive £12k ?  ! 
3	 @ MrWineTime Excuse me
