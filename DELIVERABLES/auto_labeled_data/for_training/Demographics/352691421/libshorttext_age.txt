-0.42	While Raw with  @ mcarp76 was decent ,  all I really wanted was for  @ CMPunk to wrestle . 
-0.42	Guy in front of me said Curt Hennig was good .  Understatement of the decade .  Lets talk GREAT ,  if not PERFECT
-0.42	Its not a Raw in OKC without  @ JRsBBQ and Boomer Sooner blasting through Chesapeake . 
-0.42	 @ LanceStorm You made a commercial for the 20th anniversary of Raw on the Titantron in OKC .  You were being serious for a moment . 
-0.42	 @ CamelClutchBlog Sadly ,  collecting dust .  Ill play it when all the DLC comes out ,  but its a shelver for now .

-0.42	 @ marbraina oh ,  in that case ,  I came to OK with no parents .  Just David and  @ spokid
-0.42	 @ marbraina My mom dropped Brett and myself off and said Good Luck .  Then his parents took care of us all year .  Hahah
-0.42	 @ marbraina Listening to Wage Slaves and missing you !

-0.42	Spending my night with  @ ShawnMichaels Heartbreak and Triumph .  Great DVD set .  Makes me miss the Showstopper in the ring ! 
-0.42	Nothing funnier than when in your own head ,  you can say  " I told you so "  . 
-0.42	Periphery is awful . 
-0.42	Periphery has too much going on with three guitars . 
-0.42	Theres nothing greater than listening to ten different sound checks throughout the night . 
-0.42	Norma Jean does what Norma Jean does perfectly
-0.42	The feeling of being alone at a concert is not one that Im used to . 
-0.42	I need to listen to more death metal
-0.42	 @ Ckowzan I bet if you learned how to use power chords in your songs ,  theyd be brutal as fuck .  No dissonant chords either ! 
-0.42	Havent seen Cattle Decap since the first Summer Slaughter .  .  .  Here we go
-0.42	The Ocean is a great band .  .  .  But its not the type of music you see at these tours
-0.42	I hope this hardcore dancing fool tries to dance during Cattle Decapitation .  Thatd be the end of him . 
-0.42	Metal is the only time we Oklahomans can throw up the horns . 
-0.42	Revocation is just straight sick nasty . 
-0.42	Dismantle the Dictator was all I needed from Revocation .

-0.42	 @ marbraina Ive been live tweeting Wrestlemania 3 .  DUH

-0.42	Gonna live tweet some wrestling on my wrestling handle .   @ p2pc2c  # follow
-0.42	 @ TheHistoryofWWE Got the Hogan / Flair combo .  The question is who is next for the WHC ?  Id assume Bret is next for WWF . 
-0.42	 @ marbraina more meant those in the PNW !  You actually root for the Canes .  Im just blown away by the lack of Nucks support at home . 
-0.42	How is it that no one has an NHL allegiance close to them ?  Its annoying having friends who are Devils and Rangers fans . 
-0.42	Also ,  I remember when Hoopfest was about playing basketball ,  not drinking . 
-0.42	Except the first album .  None of this 10 , 000 Fists crap . 
-0.42	Let it be known that I hate Disturbed . 
-0.42	 @ marbraina You should see the captions I send Cary in Snapchat .  Ridiculous . 
-0.42	I keep thinking about deactivating my FB .  All the toxicity of it is too draining .

-0.42	Took Daniel with my first pick in my draft !   @ VanCanucks  # Canucks  # DannySedin
-0.42	I am so miserably sick of John Cena .   @ HEELZiggler deserved that win on Raw tonight .   # RAW20
-0.42	The ladies had a fantastic match tonight .  I really like when the WWE gives them time to work instead of using then like a gimmick . 
-0.42	Cannot believe there is such a world of prejudice out there today .  Disappoints me in our society . 
-0.42	Atheist is not a dirty word .  We have the right to practice whatever we want .  No one should be shy about it anymore .  
-0.42	There are times I wish I could read minds . 
-0.42	Nothing better than a clean apartment and having a productive Saturday .  Laundry is almost done !   # trainingstartstomorrow
-0.42	Django Unchained was exactly the movie I thought it would be .  Tarantino continues to be my favorite . 
-0.42	I always find it funny when a person says that a newer movie is their favorite movie .  Have you seen no others ? 
-0.42	Sometimes I wonder how a small group of people can be so loud .   # donotmakeknockagain

-0.42	I bet every referee watching elsewhere is just as pissed about that  " pass interference "  .   # givethemthegamewhydontyou
-0.42	85 , 000 people and we couldnt force a false start if we tried .   # seahawksgetitright
-0.42	Can we get Bradford some eligibility for the rest of this game ? 
-0.42	 @ DJ _ View I have a video on my phone of  @ berchina attempting to rap .  Remind me to show you on Monday .

-0.42	I really think that a lot of people would rather stay ignorant than accept all of the things going on around us .  Learn about the world ! 
-0.42	Goal by June :  Get rid of as much credit card debt as I can and be driving in a new car .   # realworld

-0.42	 @ spokid I would actually love to hear JGL report on Fox News going crazy for 20 mins after the election was called .  He would do it so well . 
-0.42	 @ TherealRVD Washington State legalized it too ! 
-0.42	I love  @ maddow .  Calling out Fox News as she should . 
-0.42	Really hoping that these Washington State votes come through for the referendums .
