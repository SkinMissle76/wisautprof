-1	 @ RachelFairfiel1  -  you really need to see a dentist !  Not a DIY situation ! 
-1	 @ DrDawnHarper  -  she wont be the only one ! 
-1	 @ Onedirecti0n _ nz  -  see last reply but no filling should hurt !  Pit fillings often need no or little anaesthetic as shallow . 
-1	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  they do contain mercury .  Personally ,  I dont place silver fillings  ( not due to mercury )  but millions are placed every year . 
-1	 @ PrimleyParkDen  @ TheInmanAligner  -  glad you enjoyed it !  Have a great weekend !

-1	 @ SarahMcCarthy07  -  it is normal .  How long has it been ?
