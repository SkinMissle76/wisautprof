1	I have some lovely yarn here ,  but most of it is either boy or girl when put on a baby .  And its not my kid ,  so not my fight / standards .  .  . 
1	Whilst I massively respect the choice of parents - to - be not knowing boy / girl ,  is arse to knit for .  Also ,  societal expectations of colour suck

1	NERDS !  I need new - laptop advice :  
1	 @ buttonista Ive found that the lack of drying soap means frizz isnt an issue now  ( plus Im lazy ,  and this is quicker / easier !  ) 
1	 @ notanodalisque so ,  yeah ,  not exactly wasteful extravagance ! 
1	 @ notanodalisque our sales spending is likely to be a new mattress and laptop ,  which I need for work  ( to replace my now dead one )  .

1	 @ Ewan nargh ,  that wants me to install stuff  ( I dont think the other film is on Netflix )

1	 @ angusprune  @ LadyoftheCanyon there are 3 levels ,  graded in a similar way to school years / video ratings .  Most strict is only 1 being reported
1	 @ angusprune  @ LadyoftheCanyon no indeed ,  which is why O2 / etc offer this
1	 @ LadyoftheCanyon when the options are  " scared of it so no internet "  or  " some U rated content "  ,  this is a non - issue
1	 @ LadyoftheCanyon but things like NetNanny act as opt - in .  What O2 are offering parents isnt new / unusual ,  and its not  " bad "
