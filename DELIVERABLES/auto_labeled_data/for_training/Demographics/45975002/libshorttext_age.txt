-0.54	 @ skybluesam86 I have no clue .  I know its cliche for football fans to think their teams being victimised ,  but come on .  .  . 
-0.54	 @ skybluesam86 looks like hes going to be investigated for it though ,  David Bernstein said as much .  . 
-0.54	 @ skybluesam86 the thing is ,  he only did  " 2 - 0 "  because the Spurs fans were chanting  " let him die "  and throwing the coins ! 
-0.54	It is still astounding to me that the main story from yesterdays game is Theos gesture and not the rain of coins that started it all .  .  . 
-0.54	 @ skybluesam86 the boys a monster .  Hopefully we can keep a hold of him . 
-0.54	 @ skybluesam86 hopefully some more youngsters will get a run out ,  Gnabry again ,  Zelalem and Bellerin .  .

-0.54	 @ SF1034 I reckon your not being in Europe this year is a main reason for you doing so well in the league .  .  blessing in disguise ! 
-0.54	 @ SF1034 at least you avenged your defeat to hull today ,  eh ?

-0.54	 @ Swagadore  @ LandOfOzil draw please
-0.54	 @ Perfection7 its a call that a professional linesman should be getting right .  It wasnt mega close
-0.54	 @ Perfection7 he has a better view ,  looking directly down the line of the defence .  .  . 
-0.54	 @ Perfection7 even in real time I was able to tell he was onside .  Lino gets paid to make those decisions and should have got that right
-0.54	 @ Perfection7 did you not see the freeze frame where he was very very clearly onside ?  My bad tho ,  got Sterling and Sturridge mixed up
-0.54	 @ Perfection7 not sure what youre watching ,  anyway . 
-0.54	 @ Perfection7 hardly an easy mistake when Sturridge was a yard and a half onside .  .  .
