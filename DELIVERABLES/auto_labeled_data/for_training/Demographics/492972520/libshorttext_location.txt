39	I made a choice to finally let go ,  because I cant stand the pain ,  its time for my last tear to fall and smile again . 
39	Not long now until my blood turns to alcohol . 
39	I was born the day you kissed me , died the day you left me , but lived for the time that you loved me
39	Some women cant say the word lesbian .  .  .  even when their mouth is full of one . 
39	There will always be that one person youll never get over .  For me ,  its you .  But for you ,  its her . 
39	Nothing hurts more than waiting since I don’t even know what I’m waiting for anymore . 
39	Ill always admire what i really don’t understand . 
39	somebody tell my head to try and tell my heart that Im better off without you
39	The source of anxiety lies in the future .  If you can keep the future out of mind ,  you can forget your worries . 
39	Every man must do two things alone ;  he must do his own believing and his own dying . 
39	Eyes wide shut . 
39	Forever is Ours ,  Its never theirs ! 
39	Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves . 
39	 .  .  .  .  . You know that a good ,  long session of weeping can often make you feel better ,  even if your circumstances have not changed one bit . 
39	Missing you could turn from pain to pleasure ,  if I knew you were missing me too . 
39	I can always be distracted by love ,  but eventually I get horny for my creativity . 
39	Theres an important difference between giving up and letting go . 
39	Do you want to be safe and good ,  or do you want to take a chance and be great ?
