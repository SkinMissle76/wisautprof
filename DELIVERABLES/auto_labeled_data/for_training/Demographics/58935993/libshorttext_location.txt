8	 @ MisterGurd  @ snanua Dare I ask what a  " Nork "  is ?  Is it a Sonny - ism ? 
8	 @ tmoitie Ive heard some great reviews about Optimizely ,  but the pricing put me off a little .  Would you recommend it ? 
8	 @ tmoitie I honestly dont know .  Carolina look awful this season .  Mind you ,  Cams former teammates at Auburn said hes not a team player . 
8	This little dude gave the  @ detroitpistons  " Dancing Usher "  ,  a run for his money !  
8	The 49ers are going to the Super Bowl !  Thats one of my mates happy .  Just need a Pats win now for my other mate ,  for an exciting Feb 4th !

8	Game tied at 27 - 27 .  Not quite sure how we let that lead vanish ,  but the remaining 6 : 48 will be nail biting . 
8	 @ whychoose3 Are you UK - based by any chance ?  My  @ NFLGamePass video coverage is playing up too .  My bandwidth is fine though .

8	The half - time show was that good ,  the 49ers were still watching it as the second half kicked off . 
8	 @ KunalGandhi Ive driven from Wolves to Colchester ,  so I feel your pain there !  Nottinghams just manic ,  and will be until 2015 apparently ! 
8	New Orleans Pelicans ?  Seriously ?  !  The name hardly instills fear now ,  does it ?  Now ,  which marketing agency came up with that bright idea ! 
8	LSU vs .  Alabama .  One of the greatest games of football  ( of the American kind )  I have ever seen .  Rawkus ,  intense and thrilling .  Brilliant ! 
8	Whilst in  # NYC ,  I bumped into a guy ,  outside  # TrumpTower ,  who I mistakenly thought was  # Shaq .  Any idea who he is ?  
8	 @ BigunitD  @ nfl _ uk Hell yeah !   :  )  Cant wait !  Ive been to every single game hosted in London so far .  They just get better and better . 
8	 @ BigunitD I was determined to get the Nexus 4 .  It sold out in 20 mins ,  so I imagine when stock is replenished ,  itll disappear just as fast . 
8	 @ MisterGurd  @ snanua  @ ragsta86 Sorry lads ,  cant do this wknd now .  Been busy with my bros wedding  & amp ;  in NYC next week ,  so will catch up soon . 
8	I cant take much more of this Sanchez  /  Tebow switch - up .  Its like watching the Chuckle Brothers .  .  .   " To me .  To you .  To me .  To you "  . 
8	That was a nasty knee injury to one of College Footballs hottest RBs ,  Marcus Lattimore .  Hope its not as bad as it looks !   # Gamecocks .

8	Congrats to the As on winning the AL Western Division .  The postseason looks like its set to be a goodn ! 
8	Unbelievable one back in the 4th to take it to OT !  Down by 8 ,  we needed a TD ,  followed by a 2 - PT conversion and we did exactly that !   # GoBucs
8	Id love to see  # LSU give  # UGA an ass - whooping today .  I can then wear my Tigers jersey with pride ,  during the big game at Wembley tomorrow ! 
8	With the new season underway ,  Ive decided to start following NCAA College Football .  .  .  just as soon as I can get my head round it all !

8	Defense looks good .  Vincent Jacksons making big plays .  Doug Martins driving hard .  So far so good for the  # Bucs !  17 - 6 up ,  Q2 4 : 30 . 
8	 @ penelopehh I can imagine  -  bet the atmosphere was incredible !  Thanks for sharing the photo  -  I may just have to grab the programme now !   :  )

8	 @ joeypendlebury :  BUCS WIN !  It may only be the 2nd win of the season ,  but a win is a win .  RB ,  Bobby Rainey ,  was excellent .  Remember the name ! 
8	 @ penelopehh Haha ,  yep ,  suited and booted indeed .  I tell you what ,  I could get used to this lavish lifestyle !   : P
8	Great win over the Chargers to take us to 5 - 4 for the season .  If we keep up this winning momentum ,  we may even make it to the playoffs ! 
8	More than 11 million people out of a total population of 63 million in the UK ,  or 17 %  ,  now say they are NFL fans ,  according to NFL research .

8	 @ whychoose3  @ NFLGamePass I experienced problems with  @ espnplayer a few weeks ago ,  during live college football .  Its just not good enough . 
8	 @ BigunitD I think Im sitting on the halfway line ,  a few rows from the field ,  so I should be in a prime position to get some good snaps ! 
8	Just when the  # Bucs looked to take a turn for the worse ,  Eric Wright stepped up with a fantastic interception returned for a 60yd touchdown . 
8	 @ tmoitie UX is a great field to specialise in .  Its really interesting .  AB testing is vital ,  especially where major changes are involved . 
8	So ,  BlackBerry unveil the Q10 ;  their new flagship handset ,  which just so happens to be the name of a popular anti - aging cream .  .  .  how ironic .

8	 @ Brickers1985 Hey up Lee !  Great to hear from you mate .  How are you doing ?  Tough game against Bolton tonight .

8	 @ tmoitie Ah ,  youve got the Brady Bunch !  Theyve had a load of snow up there too .  Could be a good game . 
8	Looks like the Louisiana Superdome must share the same electricity suppliers as Craven Cottage .  Huge power failure .  May as well blame Tebow . 
8	 @ carlhughes23  @ penelopehh 4 - 1 ?  !  You must be smashed already !  No chance of that scoreline !  Ill take a 3 - 2 win .  .  .  to the  # Rams obviously ! 
8	So ,  Cloughies been sacked .  Its a shame to see him go ,  but unfortunately ,  it was going to happen ,  sooner or later  # TimeForChange  # DCFC
8	Just switched on the baseball ,  only to see the Oakland Athletics fans having a  " mad moment "  .  What is this  # BalfourRage craze all about ? 
8	Cant believe how unlucky my  # Bucs were to lose like that .  We were quite literally an inch away from tying the game to take it to OT .  Gutted . 
8	Finished 41 - 34 .  Harsh loss to take .  Huge decision made in the booth with the penultimate play ,  that could have cost us from tying the game . 
8	Bragging rights remain to be ours for another few months .  Well done lads .  Great win for our city .   # DerbyTilIDie
8	Congrats to Texas A & amp ; Ms QB ,  Johnny Manziel ,  on winning the 2012 Heisman Trophy  -  the 1st ever freshman to throw for 3000 yds  & amp ;  run for 1000 .

8	On the upside ,  the team performed outstandingly ,  particularly on offence .  Freeman and Jackson combined to put up some magnificent numbers .

8	 @ dcfcofficial Thanks for RT !  It was an honour to meet DCFC legends ,  both past  & amp ;  present .  1st time in corporate hospitality  -  fab experience ! 
8	I feel for the  # Redskins too .   # RG3 led a magnificent drive towards the end of the fourth ,  but unfortunately ,  it wasnt to be tonight . 
8	 @ priyesh _ lad Fantastic comeback performance .  The Bay area will be going crazy !  With the Super Bowl in N . O .  this year ,  its set to be lively !
