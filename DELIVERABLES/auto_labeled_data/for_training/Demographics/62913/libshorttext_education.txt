3	 @ PegsontheLine That is a busy week !  But sounds fun .  Happy new year to you too .  I do try to keep with your travels . 
3	 @ Independent Who do I contact regarding copyright infringement on your website ? 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ it’s pickled egg time !  
3	 @ BonsVoeux1 have you tried the Honey Kolsch from Rogue ?  Hoping that it’s better than the bacon maple ? 
3	The new responsive  @ UrbanTapHouse website has just been launched and features an up - to - date beer list  -  
3	 @ JimJolly cheers !  I learnt about it just after you left . 
3	Was fortunate to observe the sacred soil from Flanders Field on the Strand this morning .  
3	Glad that this stunning beer is still on .   -  Drinking a Snowball by  @ TheWaenBrewery at  @ jdwtweet  — 
3	 @  _  _ SteveM Yes hopefully .  At the moment you just have control over the URL . 
3	 @ DScardiffdrinks  @ thewaenbrewery Will pop down this evening ,  Im sure you wont have sold out by them . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ they don’t sell anything mainstream here

3	 @ MelissaCole just trying the I Sea Santa at  @ PoW _ VilliersSt .  You need to brew with  @ brainsbrewery more often !

3	Artwork at  @ brewdog’s  @ BrewDogShepBush is featured on Beer Lens today  -  
3	 @ skuttersrule have left half of it and moved onto a better beer  - a dry hopped Belgian IPA from Oklahoma . 
3	You can count on  @ tinyrebelbrewco for delivering the best Christmas present .  Cheers guys !  
3	 @ knowhowtohelp Ive just received it .  Thanks for your assistance . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ nothing to me ,  your account sent out a spam post . 
3	 @ unclewilco No Chocoholic but Belgian Urban IPA which I havent tried before . 
3	 @ TheWaenBrewery  @ DScardiffdrinks They must have sold out .  Popped in yesterday and there were none next to your other bottles . 
3	 @ Nermal I didn’t realise that they were on offer when I went there yesterday .  Have now stocked up . 
3	 @ dorkomatic  @ unclewilco I’m a fan of Spoons ,  just not most Christmas beers .  Having a great pint of Bath Ales Festivity in another Spoons . 
3	Gotta love the street names in London .  
3	New Year Beer ,  and what a beer .   -  Drinking an Oatmeal Yeti by  @ greatdividebrew  -  
3	Love the beer selection here .   ( at  @ SmallBarBristol )   [ pic ]  :  
3	 @ knowhowtohelp I presume when I make a purchase in store I just give them the voucher code . 
3	 @ PegsontheLine I bet .  Where next after Tallinn ? 
3	 @ NewportBus It is unfortunate that me  & amp ;  others direct such tweets at  @ newportbus when things such as bus shelters are out of your control
3	Testing out  @ exposure and its extremely easy to quickly make a stunning photo narrative  -  
3	 @ JimJolly I’m all kebabed out after having one on Saturday and one on Sunday . 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada I have got an account but rarely use it .  Think it’s the same username as on Twitter .  Which pub are you in ? 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ it’s rugby today so you don’t get any rioting .  Mind you ,  we’re playing Argentina so there’s some history  ( Falklands War ) 
3	 @ TheEveningBrews yep .  Usually not worth my while pursuing companies like that . 
3	Only in Spoons would you find drunk girls drinking cocktails with a straw from dimpled pint mugs . 
3	 @ AboutLondon Have you spotted this in London ?   ;  )  
3	Here for the architecture ,  not the beer .   (  @  Cittie of Yorke )   [ pic ]  :  
3	 @ ThreeUKSupport I think the account may possibly have the post code of NP44 3AW . 
3	 @ Beerymatt they’re happy to let you try everything too !  They sell great scotch eggs as well . 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada I’m going to guess you are in the new popup pub in Spitalfields ?   ;  ) 
3	 @ ThreeUKSupport Hi ,  Just wondering if the post code I supplied was correct ? 
3	 @ DScardiffdrinks  @ thewaenbrewery No problem .  Didnt realise there was a Xmas selection .  Thought they may have been with their other beers
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ We can do good crashes at drag races too  -  
3	 @ doncaosdelanada Don’t think I’ve been in the Pride of Spitalfields .  Have done the Crown and Shuttle . 
3	Cameras and floors don’t mix .  Does anyone have any glue ?  
3	 @ beermerchants Tesco .  Usual price was £1 . 99 but it ,  along with lots of other beers ,  were on offer for 4 for £6 . 
3	I do like a pub like  @ SmallBarBristol that makes an effort with their glassware .  
3	 @ brewdog  @ BrewDogJames  @ BrewDogShepBush enjoyed my visit .  Passionate staff ,  great beer and great food .  Got some good shots of the bar . 
3	 @ ThreeUKSupport I tried requesting an unlock code for my MiFi last week but havent received a code .  Form now doesnt work .  Can you help ? 
3	Only recently discovered that  @ BrewDogBristol are happy for customers to bring in food from  @ stnicksmarket .  
3	Im in heaven and theres lots of meat .  1 down ,  14 to go .   (  @  Viva Brazil )   [ pic ]  :  
3	 @ JimJolly they did have one hoppy pale ale but decided to go to the Queens Spoons . 
3	 @ mattappleby there’s the Porterhouse and JW Sweetman .  Probably best to get the BeoirFinder app or consult  @ TaleOfAle . 
3	Handy for  @ fgw to announce just before leaving that there are no catering facilities .  Good job I stocked up on Kernel beer and cheese ! 
3	 @ jillpne6 was checking out the new  @ HackandHop pub next to it . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ they’d throw me out for asking . 
3	 @ CarlDurose even the shopkeeper selling it to me said he’d heard bad things about it .  Should have listened to him . 
3	If I knew there were going to be tables on this bus back to the Port I would have bought a bus beer .  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ brave man ! 
3	With every meat polished off at Viva Brazil ,  it’s to time to head to  @ UrbanTapHouse to attack their beers .  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ we’re used to the rain .  It’s Britain . 
3	Good to see Irish beers being sold in Tesco .   -  Drinking a Rebel Red by  @ FranciscanWell  -

3	The two floors of the Thirsty Monk pub in Asheville ,  NC are feat .  on Beer Lens  -  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ you need to change your password on your Twitter account . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ I just tried a beer made with absinthe .  Tasted like absinthe . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ I was almost there ,  just lacking the cheese curds . 
3	A selection of 5 interior shots from  @ brewdog’s newest bar ,   @ BrewDogShepBush ,  are featured on Beer Lens  -  
3	 @ rhncafc managed to ride First Class for free .  My posh cheese shop bag  & amp ;  a copy of the Financial Times was enough to convince the conductor . 
3	 @ Nermal meant can’t recall .  Any good ? 
3	 @ PegsontheLine  @ FourBGBeau  @ michaelturtle Saw this in today’s Telegraph and had good memories .  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ at 8 %  that can’t taste good .  Bet my 7 %  Chocolate ,  Coconut and Vanilla stout tastes better  ;  )

3	The grand interior of the Cittie of Yorke pub in London is featured on Beer Lens  -  
3	Picked up some bottles Courage Imperial Russian Stout for £1 . 99 each in Tescos .  A bargain considering its £5 . 39 at Beers of Europe . 
3	Hi  @ Independent ,  who do I contact regarding copyright infringement on the Independent website ?  Have tried emailing but dont get a response . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ Wales .  It’s the Autumn International Series where northern hemisphere rugby teams play Southern Hemisphere teams . 
3	My last can of this amazing beer from  @ nodabrewing  -  Drinking a Hop ,  Drop ‘n Roll by  @ nodabrewing  -  
3	At 4 for £6 ,  couldn’t resist getting a basket of Courage Russian Imperial Stout .  Practically 8 for the price of two !  
3	Good morning London ,  what beery delights have you in store for me today ?   (  @  London Paddington Railway Station  ( PAD )  )  
3	 @ LDN  @ ChrisRawlinson posted a great shot coming into land at Heathrow  -  
3	 @ knowhowtohelp Hi ,  recd email regarding my voucher saying it has to be used by 24 / 12 .  Thats unfair considering its 1 month late arriving . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ travelling back from Cardiff to Newport  ( Home ) 
3	 @ JimJolly Think our last day is December 23rd .  When does Gerry let you finish ? 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ speaking from experience ? 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ Love a good crash .  e . g .  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ should have said that only the best northern hemisphere teams are playing  ;  ) 
3	 @ NewportBus Personally I’m very happy with the service you provide .  Big fan of the City Hop and the X30 service ! 
3	Today’s response from copyright thief ,  ‘Sorry our junior staff pinched your photo ,  as a gesture of goodwill ,  we’ll pay next time we use one’
3	 @ rhncafc I usually run out money halfway through . 
3	 @ fishter _ uk there’s never any funds available . 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada just checked out the Pride of Spitalfields and think I went there a few years ago . 
3	They also said that they have a disclaimer which ‘clearly states that no copyright infringement is intended’ .  Glad that’s cleared up . 
3	 @ LeighGoodStuff  @ markdredge Ha !  Was thinking the same .  Can’t blame a man for succumbing to a good beer . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ pouring down . 
3	 @ mattappleby I’m sure we’ll cross paths in the near future  :  ) 
3	So much better than the Rogue Bacon Maple beer .   -  Drinking a Prairie Hop by  @ Prairieales  -  
3	 @ JimJolly always jam  ;  ) 
3	 @ knowhowtohelp Hi Richard ,  I can confirm that nothing has come through .  I check my spam folder regularly too . 
3	 @ rhncafc I’m sure it would work really well in london .  Probably harder to expand to many other places
3	 @ doncaosdelanada they’re going to be there until the pub closes on Dec 20th .  Popping up on Saturday to check it out . 
3	 @ NewportBus think you need some bus shelters on High Street .  
3	 @ PegsontheLine Was quite snowy when I visited but enjoyed it .  Unfortunately only had a quick day trip to Helsinki but would like to return . 
3	My first laverbread beer and its tasty .   -  Drinking an I Sea Santa  @  The Princess of Wales  -  
3	 @ TheWaenBrewery Any plans to bottle Snowball ? 
3	Enjoying this very tasty beer from  @ dbbrewingco’s Jason Oliver .  
3	 @ unclewilco  @ dorkomatic Not sure you’d want to spend NYE in the Port ! 
3	Love how the bottled beer menus at  @ SmallBarBristol  are hidden away inside old copies of ‘The Top 10 of Everything’ 
3	 @ mattappleby cheers .  We wanted to make sure that the  @ urbantaphouse could update the beers and they’re doing a great job so far . 
3	 @ mattappleby think you may be in the shot I took on the Events page of the Urban Tap House website  ;  ) 
3	 @ BonsVoeux1 usually enjoy most of Rogue  beers .  Picked that one up in North Carolina but after the bacon maple wondering what it’ll be like . 
3	 @ BonsVoeux1 they weren’t on my radar at all until this beer arrived .  The description on that beer sounds so good . 
3	 @ shotbykim My Prime delivery didn’t show today .  Was 160mi away in Gatwick at 4pm .  Amazon CS said they’re confident it’ll be delivered today ! 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada it’s called the  @ HackandHop and is just off Fleet Street .  Opened this week . 
3	Another  @ fgw train ,  another journey stood next to the toilet .  Guess I shouldn’t expect anything less . 
3	A trip to London wouldn’t be complete without a visit to  @ paxtonscheese .  
3	 @ rhncafc I used to have a site just for that but you could run into trouble legally with it .  Here’s my response  -  
3	 @ TheWaenBrewery The Snowball in Spoons in Newport is tasting amazing !  Easily the best beer on . 
3	 @ shotbykim I was the only one there do they just kept bringing me more and more meat  :  ) 
3	First pub of the day  -   @ PoW _ VilliersSt 
3	Love the light and spacious interior of  @ brewdog’s newest bar ,   @ BrewDogShepBush .  Lots of quirky furniture .  
3	 @ BonsVoeux1  @ prairieales Agree with you there .  First I’ve tried from them and very impressed .  Was really disappointed with the Rogue . 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada I’m robgale on Instagram . 
3	 @ TheWaenBrewery  @ DScardiffdrinks  Great  :  )  Will definitely be picking some up . 
3	Christmas present to myself ,  and what a pres .  .  .   ( Thornbridge  & amp ;  S : t Eriks Imperial Raspberry Stout )  
3	Even at 99p a pint ,  Wetherspoons can’t convince me to buy a Christmas beer . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ We won’t be calling ,  we don’t want you taking all the credit like you usually do ! 
3	 @ JimJolly They have a sour beer ! 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ how else are you going to eat a pickled eggs whilst standing at the bar ! 
3	 @  _  _ SteveM At the moment there arent any privacy options available . 
3	 @ NewportBus cheers for replying .  We all took shelter in the arcade but would be useful having a shelter for each stop . 
3	Enjoying  @ BrewDogBristol all to myself .  
3	 @ TheWaenBrewery Hopefully some bottles of Snowball will be making its way down here . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ taking photos whilst driving ?  You’re as bad as me ? 
3	 @ knowhowtohelp My CC ref is  -  CC0002134623
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ That’s a pretty impressive way to stop your car . 
3	 @ ThreeUKSupport Hi ,  yes I received an email yesterday and have unlocked the MiFi .  Thanks . 
3	In Bristol’s newest pub ,   @ SmallBarBristol .  Great interior and equally good beer selection .  
3	Paying a visit to  @ UrbanTapHouse today .  Hope they update the beers on the new website before I get there . 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada hopefully will also check out the new BrewDog and the new pub from the Dean Swift / Old Red Cow owners on Fleet Street . 
3	Hoping that this will become a permanent seasonal beer .   -  Drinking a Snowball by  @ TheWaenBrewery  -  
3	In my ongoing quest to find the cheapest pint of Kernel Table Beer ,   @ BrewDogShepBush is doing well at £4 . 25 ,  Euston Tap not so good at £4 . 40
3	Probably shouldnt be drinking this at this time of the day .  .  .  .   ( Citrus Ninja Exchange )  
3	 @ Joel _ Hughes  @ SmallBarBristol they only sell beers from small breweries and will soon be brewing their own beer . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ Very impressive how the roll cage was still intact . 
3	 @ curryspcworld Does it normally take 10 days to get a response from your Promotional Team ?  Still waiting .  My case is CC0002134623
3	Good to see that  @ tinyrebelbrewco’s Dirty Stop Out is on the starting lineup at  @ BrewDogShepBush
3	Think I need to attack my  @ beercupboard tomorrow .  
3	 @ PegsontheLine  @ FourBGBeau  @ michaelturtle Definitely . How are you finding Tallinn ?  Visited a few yrs ago .  Nice place ,  easy access to Helsinki
3	 .  @ fgw Is there a record for the most people crammed into a Cardiff to Portsmouth train ?  If not ,  you should start with this service . 
3	 @ TheWaenBrewery there were still some bottles of Snow Ball left  :  )  
3	 @ shotbykim I hope so but it’ll have to get a taxi from the bus station because I’m not going to collect it ! 
3	I’m in cheese heaven !   / cc  @ paxtonscheese 
3	 @ PegsontheLine That’s unusual .  I thought it was a given that they would have snow this time of year . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ heading to another pub  ;  ) 
3	 @ beermerchants can’t imagine they’re making much on a bottle . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ yep .  It’s match day here this afternoon so got to the pub early before the crowds . 
3	Spent this afternoon at the newly opened  @ TheCBSC popup pub on Shoreditch High St .  They have a selection of  @ Beerlens photos on display . 
3	 @ jillpne6 unsure what it was like before but it’s nice w /  a good beer selection and judging by the other pubs they own ,  food should be good . 
3	 @ knowhowtohelp Hi ,  Im looking for an update regarding my missing voucher . 
3	 @ rhncafc I have !  Hopefully will extend beyond London . 
3	Skipped dessert and went straight for the Custard Pie  -  Drinking a Custard Pie at  @ urbantaphouse  -  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ I wouldn’t try it .  Van Gogh used to drink it and it and he cut off his ear . 
3	 @ mattappleby I did recognise you from Untapped but wasn’t 100 %  sure it was you .  My company built the site so was taking a few shots for it . 
3	 @ NateDawg27 you can pick it up from Ales By Mail .  
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ sounds awful ! 
3	 @ NewportBus We automatically presume that you are responsible for all things like that when it’s the council that’s responsible . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ we don’t get that over here . 
3	Surprised that a company that used my photo without asking blamed the  @ eustontap for telling them to take my photo from Google Images . 
3	Spending the afternoon taking shots of the  @ UrbanTapHouse for their new website .  
3	Seems that if  @ Carlsberg _ UK upload the wrong SanMiguel website its not an issue if my photo is reuploaded .  Ill soon be rich from apologies
3	 @ rhncafc  @ UrbanTapHouse I also had to make sure their food and beer was in good nick too… .  It was . 
3	 @ SmallBarBristol Looking forward to popping over to take some shots for Beer 
3	Checking out the new  @ HackandHop off Fleet Street .  Good beer selection like their sister pubs .  
3	 @ mattappleby  @ TaleOfAle  @ farringtons1696  @ Porterhousebars  Good to hear .  Where’s next ? 
3	Nightcap before a trip to the smoke tomorrow ,  an .  .  .   ( Stone 17th Anniversary Götterdämmerung IPA )  
3	 @ FelicityMorse Thanks Felicity ,  Ive just forwarded on my original email sent to the Customer Services address . 
3	 @ knowhowtohelp The KnowHow team have already got all my info .  Case number CC0002134623 .  Dealt with Catherine Sheppard . 
3	 @ MeatWagonBBQ Lamb with a mint and ranch dressing and slaw .  Tasted good . 
3	Caught  @ Carlsberg _ UK using one of my photos on their San Miguel website .  They remove it ,  then a month later they put the photo back !  Cheeky ! 
3	TIL why  @ theribman named his hot sauce Holy Fuck .  
3	Bit disappointed with this .   -  Drinking a Voodoo Doughnut Bacon Maple Ale by  @ rogueales  -  
3	 @ rhncafc  @ MelissaCole  @ BrewDogShepBush  @ theribman I think someone else may have been at that sauce .  I wast brave enough to use that much ! 
3	 @ rhncafc forgot to add that the fries were double cooked in salt .  Best not take a photo of the Black pudding scotch egg I’ve got for later
3	 @ Beerymatt I don’t think I’ve managed to get in and out in less than 30 minutes . 
3	 @ doncaosdelanada the new popup has got a selection of beer lens photos on display there  :  )
