2	Some great product ideas being shared at  # ictlive
2	 @ PontybreninYGG diolch .  Come and hi in the break  -  both my boys at pontybrenin ! 
2	Importance of allowing students to share their work with a wider audience  -  key benefit of  # hwb according to  @ Aledrhys1
2	 .  @ Aledrhys1 doing a great job of showing off hwb +   -  importance of using student digital leaders to train students ,   staff and parents
2	Missing tools  -  
2	Sime tweets didnt send !  Lesson 3  -  use the tech to teach the tech . 
2	All tweets during my talk were sent using an awesome little app called backdraft .  Definitely my tip of the week !  !  ! 
2	Slides and links from my session will be up on my blog in the next few minutes  -  
2	Bonus tool  -  Airserver .  Allows you to mirror you iOS device to a laptop ,  and then on to a projector .  Much cheaper than Apple TVs
2	Lesson 9  -  your staff are awesome .  Give them the tools they need to show that . 
2	Tool 9  -  Hwb +   -  centrally funded national Learning Platform currently being rolled out across Wales .  Great tools ,  esp for collaboration . 
2	Lesson 8  -  Use SAMR model  (  or similar )  to check if what youre doing is really making a difference .  Google it ! 
2	Lesson 7  -  Build capacity .  Use staff to train each other .  Create PLCs .  Create student digital leader team .  See  @ digitalleaderuk
2	Tool no 7  -   @ edmodo  -  awesome ,  free learning platform ,  based on social media experience .  Also great mob device integration . 
2	Lesson 6  -  Sometimes you have to make it compulsory .  Checking email .  ICT in PMF for 2 yrs .  Just accept people have different starting points
2	Lesson 5  -  What pedagogy are you /  they trying to develop ?  Choose tech to match .  Instructions ?  Drill ?  Co construction ?  Work that out first
2	Lesson 4  -  playtime is important .  If you want teachers to get what youre showing ,  give them the time to play with it in your training . 
2	Tool 4  -   @ Padlet online sticky wall .  Share link with students for great hm / wk or reflection space .  Web and iOS versions . 
2	Also note recent versions of ppt and all versions of Keynote allow you to easily turn slideshows into narrated videos  # flippedclassroom
2	Tool 3  -  Explain Everything .  IOS app .  Annotate work ,  turn ppts into videos .  Not free ,  but worth every penny . 
2	Lesson 2  -  give people useful things .  Teachers are too busy for your initiative .  Ask them what they want ,  find something they can use
2	Tool no 2 is Google Apps for Education .  Huge amount of potential and free for schools .  
2	Lesson no 1  -  small parts loosely joined beats one big system that does everything ,  but nothing well .  If you get SSO even better ! 
2	Get your own account and try passing links on to students .  Or try creating a backchannel .  
2	Tool no 1 is Twitter !  Great way to connect with other educators or recent developments in your subject .  Use hashtags to follow events /  chats
2	Hopefully the next few tweets will be summaries and links from my talk at the  @ ictforeducation show in Swansea
2	Just arrived at the  @ ictforeducation event in Swansea .  Looking forward to catching up with some people
2	Looking forward to speaking at the  @ ICTforEducation event in Swansea tomorrow .  Thought I was  @ yrhenblwyf s warm up act ,  but hes on first ! 
2	 # addcym Thanks for all the ideas tonight ,  especially to those who are new to contributing  : 0 ) 
2	 @ cardiffscience  # addcym All of the above ,  plus Christmas concerts and general festive panic !  Thanks for your input  : 0 ) 
2	 # addcym Final Q for this evening  -  what might the wider implications of the LNF be ?  Will be changing our curriculum model ,  esp at sec level ? 
2	 # addcym What’s anyone doing about tracking progress or reporting ? 
2	RT  @ nicolaclarke183 :   @ davestacey  # addcym this seems to work with more teachers taking responsibility .  It has also helped with mapping . 
2	 # addcym Anyone been able to tap into LEA or Consortia schemes ?  In Swansea weve got 8 reading behaviours . 
2	 @ nicolaclarke183 Who are your ‘super literacy  /  numeracy’ depts ?  Is it just Eng  /  Maths or is it wider ?   # addcym
2	RT  @ nicolaclarke183 :   @ davestacey  # addcym the super literacy / numeracy departments have specific training which is then fed out through plc . 
2	 # addcym Has anyone found their classroom activities changing as a result ?  Did text types training last night .  v . useful
2	 @ MRGMO  # addcym Is that a common resource that all teachers use ? 
2	 # addcym Are specific departments in secondary schools taking responsibility for particular areas ? 
2	 # addcym Anyone been involved in any mapping  /  auditing activities ?  How did you find the LNF as an auditing tool ? 
2	 # addcym There are still big questions about how to embed effectively  & amp ;  how it will be reported on ,  so tonights chat is focussed on progress
2	 # addcym To hep address the first ,  from Sept 2013 the Literacy and Numeracy Framework  ( or LNF )  became statutory
2	 # addcym Evening all .  Education priorities in Wales are Literacy ,  Numeracy and reducing the impact of poverty . 
2	RT  # addcym from 8pm tonight  -  How are you getting on with the LNF ?  !  Come and share your progress ,  your ideas and your concerns .   # LNFCym  # LNF

2	 # addcym Thanks again for all ideas tonight .  Certainly helped my thinking around LNF .  Have a great week everyone  : 0 ) 
2	 @ asober  @ MRGMO  # addcym That ,  in a nutshell ,  is my problem with the LNF approach .  Need to chew it over with you over a coffee soon ! 
2	 @ MRGMO  @ asober  # addcym That would be really helpful .  Thanks
2	 @ GlynRogers Diolch i ti hefyd .   : 0 ) 
2	 @ asober  @ MRGMO  # addcym But let’s look at that row  -  it appears in Yr 8 and then disappears .  Not sure that continuum works tbh
2	 @ asober  @ MRGMO  # addcym  -  Ok .  That I can see more .  Thanks .  Useful  : 0 ) 
2	 # addcym Also a youth version on the same site  ( 
2	 # addcym Many thanks to all who have shared tonight .  Please do add your views by replying to the consultation .  
2	 @ asober  @ MRGMO  # addcym Hmmmm… . 
2	 @ GlynRogers  # addcym Ambitious indeed ,  but absolutely ! 
2	 @ asober  @ MRGMO Calculate difference between BC and AD .  Convert ft to mtrs .  All things we’ve done happily in the past  # addcym
2	 @ MRGMO  @ asober  # addcym I’m just not sure that that’s the case ! 
2	 @ MRGMO  @ asober  # addcym I’d like to feel that there was an openness around where it’s working ,  and how to improve it moving forward . 
2	 @ MRGMO  @ asober  # addcym To be fair ,  I’m not sure I have a solution at the mo ,  just not 100 %  convinced by it at the moment . 
2	 @ MRGMO  @ asober  # addcym No ,  of course not .  But when I can’t match the rich numeracy tasks we do in Hist back to the LNF something’s not right
2	 # addcym Moving away from the consultation slightly ,  final ten minutes ,  what would your vision for the Curriculum for Wales be ? 
2	 # addcym Next idea  -  strengthen teacher assessment at KS2 with Rich Tasks  ( p27 )   -  
2	 @ asober  # addcym Id agree with all of that ! 
2	 @ asober  @ MRGMO Lit not so much .  Probs with Num though . 
2	 @ welshgje  # addcym Only if you tell us what you think of the proposed curriculum changes ?   ; 0 )  Will look later matey
2	 # addcym And if were reporting on progress in skills ,  how we define outcomes in those ? 
2	 # addcym If “We should assess what we value . ”  ( p19 )  .  Might the focus on LNF mean schools limit the creative stuff ? 
2	 @ asober  # addcym Great stuff .  Thanks .  Will read through that later . 
2	 # addcym To be fair ,  much of the document I find very positive indeed . 
2	 @ MRGMO  # addcym Would you be up for sharing those ?  I’d love to get this clearer in my head ! 
2	 # addcym How about this  -  should schools no longer have to report to WG on foundation subjects ? 
2	 @ MRGMO  # addcym  # lnfcym Based on what ?  Ive had some real issues mapping what we do in History back to the LNF for example . 
2	 @ asober  # addcym Fully accept that I may need to develop my understanding further .  That’s why I’d love to read the research behind it ! 
2	 @ asober  # addcym If I need the LNF for that I have no right being in the classroom !  !  ! 
2	 @ asober  # addcym I find the whole grid approach very artificial though .  For all their faults to my mind level descriptors do a better job
2	 @ asober  # addcym People don’t learn in straight lines ! 
2	 @ asober  # addcym But where has that description come from ?  I remain to be convinced it’s always a valid description of progress . 
2	 @ aclewett  # addcym But I’m happy to be corrected if I’ve got that wrong ! 
2	 @ aclewett  # addcym As I understand LNF says in yr X you should be able to .  My take is that that approach could be rolled out further . 
2	 @ GlynRogers  # addcym Evening .  Ill be honest .  The idea that we link achievement to age bothers me a great deal .  Levels summative at the mo ? 
2	 # addcym wider skills :  crit thinking  & amp ;   prob solving ,  planning  & amp ;  organisation ,  creativity  & amp ;   innovation ,  personal effectiveness  & amp ;  dig lit
2	 # addcym Should wider key skills form a statutory part of the curriculum ? 
2	 # addcym quiet night .  Hopefully it will pick up in a bit  ( I though GBBO had finished !  )  Lets try another Q .  .  . 
2	 @ cardiffscience  # addcym I dont know .  The consultation talks of being evidence based ,  but I havent seen any for the structure of the LNF
2	 # addcym Is anyone aware of the evidence that this year - by - year description is an accurate or useful way to measure progress ? 
2	 # addcym The first idea is to take the year on year approach laid out in the LNF and base the new model on that .  Is this a good idea ? 
2	 # addcym  ( 2 / 2 )  .  .  .  focus on curriculum  & amp ;  assessment changes that will strengthen  & amp ;  support the teaching of lit  & amp ;  num across the curriculum . 
2	 # addcym So ,  there is to be a two part consultation .  This first part is based on the LNF ,  LNF tests and intends to .  .  .   ( 1 / 2 ) 
2	 # addcym By way of an intro ,  and while I grab a coffee ,  you could do worse than read the intro by  @ WG _ EducationMin   -  
2	 # addcym Tonight  ( and perhaps mindful of PISA )  ,  well be talking about the current consultation on the future of the curriculum in Wales .

2	 @ rosieadavies Thanks Rosie  -  very interesting discussion tonight .  Top job ! 
2	 @ rosieadavies  @ richards _ james  @ mrgpg Yep .  Really need to find an eve to go back and get that up and running .  .  . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Wasnt a member ,  but there was a PLC across our family of schools at one point .  Seemed a good idea ! 
2	 # addcym  .  .  .  Concerns are that that part  ( research )  is often missed ,  misunderstood ,  or easy to do badly .   ( 2 / 2 ) 
2	 # addcym PLCs seem a great opportunity to get the idea of research and evidence into schools .   ( 1 / 2 ) 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Sometimes want to encourage teacher led innovation and variation .  PLCs seem to offer this very effectively . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Not sure consistent initiative roll - out is always top priority . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Other times ,  whole school can be most effective . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Dont think theres one model .  Depends on what topic and what you want .  ICT eg should be little ,  often and on demand
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym From what I remember everyone at Holywell High was put into a PLC for a year . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Read about them several years ago ,  in guidance from WG .  Remember  @ wjputt being passionate advocate . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Not involved personally ,  so couldnt say for sure .  Suspect PLCs might be part of the advice from WG on rolling out LNF
2	 # addcym Heard lots of ref to PLCs as a synonym for working party .  Not sure the research element survives in many places . 
2	 @ rosieadavies  # addcym Evening .  Weve got lots of staff led workshops etc ,  but only recently PLCs  ( for Lit and Num ) 
2	Surely there has to be a Maths or Physics lesson in this video ?  
2	Just booked my place for  # TLAB14  -  choosing sessions was a real headache  -  way too many good people speaking ! 
2	 @ 4goggas Hi Kerry .  Would you be ok with me using the hexagons pic from this blog post in a TM Presentation tomorrow ?

2	 # addcym Next week  ( I think )  its  @ rosieadavies in the chair and well be discussing what makes a successful PLC
2	Thanks to  @ mrgpg for moderating  # addcym tonight  -  sorry I vanished towards the end ! 
2	 @ rosieadavies But how does anyone looking at your followers know they’re a student .  Could be parent or community member surely ?
