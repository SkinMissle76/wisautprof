17	 @ SooThomas I agree ,  my point is no one should get an honour for just doing their job . 
17	 @ BizzyRascal when was it ?  I know I was purchasing them whilst chatting to  @ AllaboutCroydon in your cafe earlier  .    @ thegaryhawkins
17	I despair at so called intelligent people / sheep who watch that X - factor crap . Proud to say ,  Ive NEVER watched any of it ,  as I have a life .

17	 @ TheDukeofSurrey  " over the county line "  ?  But you LIVE in Croydon .  Are you still in denial of the fact ? 
17	Lets place bets on how long my train journey from Reigate to East Cronx will take tonight .   # southernFail
17	Really not used to being up so early on a Sunday morning . 
17	 @ Daylightfire make it a Wednesday night ,  and we can take advantage of cheep booze in the Bell . 
17	I just earned the Weekday Warrior badge on  @ untappd !  
17	 @ SouthernRailUK not disputing this .  But if its so important why not have more than 1 person checking tickets and install more gates
17	This journey back home ,  might be OK now .  .  .  
17	 @ goughie69 ah phew ,  was getting worried that I was in the minority .  I really hate all the hype that surrounds that X - factor crap . 
17	Christmas shopping ?   (  @  Ann Summers HQ )  
17	First pint of 2014 .  Better make it a good one ,  I suppose .   (  @  Home Cottage Pub )  
17	Mini Cheddars !  !

17	Comiserating .  .  .   (  @  The Royal Standard )  
17	 @ TheDukeofSurrey and you learn how to spell ,  you illiterate snob ! 
17	 @ thegaryhawkins told yer ,  we should have stayed for another one  ( or two ) 
17	 @ threeuksupport why have I had no data signal in Hyde Park this afternoon ? 
17	 @ TheDukeofSurrey Ive no idea what youre sayin
17	 @ blacksquarebrig can you blame them ?  Whod want to live in the Cronx if they had a choice ? 
17	 @ PbnowD he thinks were not important enough for him to waste his time with  @ TheDukeofSurrey
17	 @ PbnowD oh ,  are you really ?  oh well .  .  . 
17	 @ GiraffeBanners and the fish wasnt bad either ! 
17	 @ TfLBusAlerts  @ METROBUS why have I had to wait 25 minutes for a 64 bus from Selsdon to East Croydon ? 
17	 .   @ TheDukeofSurrey saw this and thought of you .  .  .  
17	 @ TheDukeofSurrey but you do live in Croydon . 
17	Escaping for a few days  (  @  London  @ Gatwick _ Airport  ( LGW )  w /  17 others )  
17	I suppose celebrating the opening of a new station entrance is a highlight ,  when youre a town like the Cronx . 
17	 @ Trombonewaaard I thought it was actually quite appropriate . 
17	 @ PbnowD if you do ,  make sure you also wear a pair of UGGs ,  it would have a profound effect on  @ TheDukeofSurrey
17	I just earned the Merry Brew - mas  ( 2013 )  badge on  @ untappd !  
17	 @ thegaryhawkins are you sure youre not referring to the Reigate women that dont work ? 
17	 @ Get _ mummy _ a _ gin but youve got gin .  So everything should be alright ? 
17	time to reflect  & amp ;  commiserate .  .  . 
17	I do have a couple of hopes and best wishes ,  but Im not gonna share them as theyre private  & amp ;  I dont need to brag about them . 
17	 @ Trombonewaaard really not sure what Ive said to offend you .  Oh well ,  your loss I suppose . 
17	 @ HangingPuppet and Merry Christmas to you .  Was about to say hi as we left ,  but you werent there .  So wasnt ignoring you either . 
17	Hoping everyone is surviving  " Suicidal Sunday "  ,  today . 
17	Cant beat the Breakfast Rolls !   (  @  Cooplands )  
17	Just seen the weather warnings for Monday ,  am concerned I wont make it back in time for the panto that evening . 
17	 @ tazismad not moving just stranded in Redhill
17	 @ Trombonewaaard when do you go back ?   ;  -  ) 
17	Having a G & amp ; T .  Nothing more to add .  
17	 @ SouthernRailUK thanks for reply .  By red zone do you mean the platform ?   & amp ;  does line block mean closing the track ?  Seems bit excessive
17	Happy Easter !  !  
17	 @ 98rosjon my life would be  great if  @ SouthernRailUK provided the service I pay an extortionate amount for ! 
17	 @ PbnowD have a great holiday . 
17	 @ LizardNun thanks for that .  Still think too much is spent for a couple of minutes of wow . 
17	Gone for a walk ,  to get away from it all .  .  . 
17	 @ TheDukeofSurrey  @ Trombonewaaard have fun there
17	Anybody know what the heck this is meant to be ?  
17	Ah good memories of being in Chicago .

17	 @ thegaryhawkins no to me ,  Boxing Day is forever known as Suicidal Sunday . 
17	 @ tazismad hardly .  Youre better than me !   ;  -  ) 
17	And seriously whats the point in making  new year resolutions ?  Chances are youll never stick to them . 
17	 @ SouthernRailUK the performance results on your website ,  havent been updated since August .  Are you hiding something ?  
17	How Ive missed shopping here .   (  @  C & amp ; A )  
17	 @ PbnowD yes I did .  It was rather nice .  Thank you . 
17	 @ neilspellings I remember using the beta version of Netscape and before that ,  the Lynx text browser   @ HistoricalPics
17	Farewell Amsterdam ,  its been great to getaway ! Cheers !  !  
17	 @ goughie69 Im impressed !  Keep up the good work  ( trying not to sound too patronising ) 
17	 @ TheDukeofSurrey thought they took a selfie instead ?   @ Trombonewaaard
17	 @ AGirl _ ALife I just read BBC news ,  so I assumed it was true .  When did they ever get it wrong ?   ;  -  ) 
17	Yet again the departure gate is furthest away from the departure lounge .  One day ,  maybe itll be from gate 1 .  Though I doubt it very much . 
17	 @ thegaryhawkins you have been !  !   ;  -  )    @ BizzyRascal

17	Oh I how I like waiting for non - existant bus in the cold !   :  -  ( 
17	 @ METROBUS why the long waits for the 64 bus in Croydon tonight ?   @ TfLBusAlerts
