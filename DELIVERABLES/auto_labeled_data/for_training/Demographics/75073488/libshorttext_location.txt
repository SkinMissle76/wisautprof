23	I dont see the point in doing an audio slideshow AND a video for this multi media package thing .  Itll be the same interview twice ?  ! 
23	Can someone from uni please tell me how long the article part of the multi - media pack has to be ?  I refuse to go on that forsaken sunspace .

23	I know Im a bit behind having just read / seen POBAW but  @ LoganLerman is exactly how I pictured Charlie in the book .  Portrayed perfectly . 
23	Since I read the book in a day ,  think Ill give Perks of Being a Wallflower a watch ! 
23	After sitting with the TV on mute for about 20 mins ,  Ive now realised why I dont sit in complete silence more
23	Huge pet peeve :  people who spell definitely defiantly .  More people do it than Id like to think . 
23	Spots are so weird

23	More personal life goals than resolutions . 
23	On a lighter note ;  yes I have resolutions ,  no Im not sharing them .  That way if I break them theres only me to answer to . 
23	ITS JUST WEIRD .  And I know the circumstances are strange but just PACK IT IN .  You should know when to say ,  actually ,  no . 
23	Creep . 
23	And the fact that you let your little dog tag along with you is too fucking far mate .  Fuck off with your own family ,  or better yet ,  hers . 
23	Why the fuck are you still ANYTHING to do with my family ?  You are my EX . 
23	Well thats fucking pissed me off .  You know when you just smile and let it happen for too long without saying anything ? 
23	THE TARGET WAS BEHIND ME AT ONE POINT AND STILL MANAGED TO RUN PAST
23	I swear to god Altair if you insist on running up everything while Im trying to sprint toward the target I will end you .   # assassinscreed
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy haha shush let me be bitter !

23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy hahah am I fuck its too late in the day for that shit .  Im just sick of people posting about theirs and reminding me
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy haha wish it was that simple my friend ! 
23	Seeing everyone posting statuses about doing work and I seriously cant even begin to look at it .  The thought alone stresses me the fuck out
23	Gee ,  thanks ,  The Fault In Our Stars for THAT subconscious message ! 
23	So last nights dream consisted of me having terminal lung cancer ,  and being really upset cause all I wanted was to give my mam grandbabies
23	Just finished reading The Fault In Our Stars .  Only took me a day ,  such a good read .  Brb ,  crying .

23	 @ Gagsy92 hahaa me too ! 
23	 @ Gagsy92 I know I havent seen it this year either ! 
23	 @ Gagsy92 I recall what scene it actually was !  It was the brick scene .  .  .  Harrrryyyy ?  .  .  .  .  Haaarrryyy ! 
23	 @ Gagsy92 hahah she certainly did .  .  she was like AW HELL NAW
23	 @ Gagsy92 dammit !  Isnt hindsight a wonderful thing ?  I may pretend I did say that in future re - tellings or this story .  .  . 
23	 @ Gagsy92 haha I was more like da fuck haha !  I dont think I put 2 and 2 together for a couple seconds
23	 @ Gagsy92 apparently he was a suspect for other burglaries too
23	 @ Gagsy92 the police didnt even do anything they made a spectacle over Christmas then didnt even charge him and let him go . 
23	 @ Gagsy92  .  .  he ran away when he saw me though .  I ran after him but he jumped the fence onto a pitch black field
23	 @ Gagsy92  .  .  .  Obviously thought no one was in .  .  .  Even though you can see the TV from the back room and it was clearly on . 
23	 @ Gagsy92  .  .  . I got up to check and the dog was asleep and when I looked up into the back room he was just stood staring at me .  .  . 
23	 @ Gagsy92 I was sitting in the living room when he came in the back of the house ,  I heard something but thought it was the dog .  .  .   ( cont ) 
23	Dont worry guys ,  he didnt get away with anything ,  caught him before he got the chance .   # topdetective
23	It was one year ago today that I caught a burglar in my house .  Strangely enough I was watching Home Alone at the time . 
23	 @ evanrachelwood and  @ 1jamiebell are the sweetest most well matched couple in the universe .  If I ever have a relationship like that .  .   # happy
23	 @ evanrachelwood  @ NikkiReed _ I _ Am omg yes I am so excited right now
23	 @ jarpad congratulations on your little holidays baby !  I bet Thomas will love his little brother .  Any names yet ? 
23	WOAR AS IF ITS CHRISTMAS TOMORROW
23	Stupid knock at the door waking me up
23	I have been having some crazy as shit dreams as of late
23	Bitch cant even wait til the kid is born to become a huge pain in the arse . 
23	As if its not bad enough seeing girls with there occupation as full time mammy on facebook ,  Ive just seen a soon to be full time mammy
23	 @  _ Spiced _ Rum _  
23	 @  _ Spiced _ Rum _  Hahahaha !  Agreed .  Theyre much more relatable
23	 @  _ Spiced _ Rum _  
23	Does anyone actually find Alex Zane funny ?  Literally the shittest craic ever .  On par with Harry Hill . 
23	 @ AcesHigh _  _  _  _  yeah I know  :  (  its a present for me anyway haha !  I just ordered it for my mam
23	Ordered something last week ,  meant to take up to 7 working days to come .  .  .  It only just got shipped today .  Christ . 
23	 @ LiamNashy that is so nice  :  )  actually made me smile for the first time today !  Thank you ! 
23	People are dicks . 
23	 @ LiamNashy so then why do I care about others feelings so much ?  They dont give a shit about mine . 
23	 @ LiamNashy just been thinking and it happens more than Id like to admit .  Genuine regard for someones feelings is so rare these days . 
23	When you think of the roles in the reverse you dont half see the hypocrisy in some people . 
23	More to the point why do I put up with it ? 
23	Why do people seem to think its okay to walk all over me and have a complete disregard for my feelings ? 
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy no YOURE awesome !   :  ) 
23	Got dat Sunday feeling
23	I am feeling very meh today
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy awwwwh you little sweetheart !   :  )  same goes for you ! 
23	 @ AcesHigh _  _  _  _  also your prof pic looks rather ominooos
23	 @ AcesHigh _  _  _  _  was good seeing you today man  :  )  hope you are well ! 
23	 # BouncersAreKnobs
23	Covered in bruises after last night ,  stupid bouncer shoving me into a table to get to a fight .  .  .  That already had 2 bouncers breaking it up . 
23	Even though Im probably gonna spend half the day in bed anyway . 
23	Actually didnt wanna wake up but when I looked at the time thought I shouldve . 
23	Best nights sleep . 
23	I remember beig terrified of the slide in seaside sammys .  I never did go down .  .  .  Well willingly anyway .  
23	 @ LiamNashy hahaha oh god  :  ) 
23	Omg  @ kevinbacon profile pic is where Roger dresses up as him in American Dad .  .  .  Day made
23	Maybe then sleep will come . 
23	Soon enough Im gonna start thinking Im fucking Socrates or something so Im gonna put my phone away and squeeze my eyes shut tight . 
23	Nothing good ever happens after 2am .  How I Met Your Mother taught me that . 
23	Aaand now Im having those seemingly philosophical revelations that people have when theure exhausted .  When really theyre just bullshit
23	BUT THERE IS SO MUCH TO PONDER ,  IS THERE NOT ? 
23	Im guessing thats what is keeping me up .  .  .  My mind running 1000 miles per minute . 
23	My thought processes change very quickly and erratically .  As you can probably see from my tweets .  Seconds apart ,  complete different subject . 
23	Can I be a witch plz
23	I like sleep and I had a good sleeping pattern !  !  Damn whatever it is keeping me awake .  Damn it to hell . 
23	Why am I awake .  Usually I cant keep my eyes open past 12 and this past week Ive been up til like 3 / 4 . 
23	Everyone wants to kill Fiona ,  but I love her .   # AHSCoven
23	Surprise bitch ,  I bet you thought youd seen the last of me .   # AHSCoven
23	The cute little face Kyle makes when Zoey puts headphones on him .   # AHSCoven
23	Well ,  Queenie didnt hesitate for very long to switch sides did she ?   # AHSCoven
23	 @ curtisjt _  those are the reasons I hope to be one someday haha ! 
23	 @ curtisjt _  well obviously you would think that !  Kyle is lush though so cant blame them for wanting to make a sandwich with him .  .  . 
23	 @ curtisjt _  not saying it wasnt hot .  .  .  But the long term of it all .  .  not sure how I feel . 
23	 @ millieme0w Lushy lips on your prof pic babe
23	Im not sure how I feel about the Zoey - Madison - Kyle threesome .  .  .   # AHSCoven
23	 @ Kiiiiirstenn I expected as much .  I ordered it last week but it only just got shipped today .  Hopefully will get it before new year
23	 @ millieme0w that sounds suitable .  I wonder whether hell think that is mega lolz
23	 @ millieme0w well I think prison alone will be a death sentence .  Hell get slaughtered in there ,  thats if he doesnt kill himself first
23	Hey kid ,  dont you think youve got to try and be somebody ?  Yeah ,  it happens on its own . 
23	 @ bethmoore _  _  yeah I know its disgusting .  He also said he didnt know what everyone was so freaked about .  Hmmm .  .  .  Well . 
23	Ian Watkins has been sentenced to 35 years .  Proof that they dont always go easy on celebrities .  Good . 
23	Nil .  I imagine that is the answer .  Ill be lucky if I get it before New Year ! 
23	What are the chances of a package coming from America ,  which has just been shipped ,  coming before Christmas ? 
23	 @ OsricChau finally caught up on the SPN mid season finale .  WHAT THE HELL DUDE !  I did NOT see that coming .  This will not do .  I am very upset . 
23	Finally caught up on the mid season finale of Supernatural .  WHAT THE HELL YOU CANT LEAVE IT LIKE THAT
23	When you have to kill Walter in Fable 3 .  Cruel .  Very emotional . 
23	Is it just me or did 2 broke girls get shit ?  Its full of crap one liners and seriously shan craic . 
23	 @ LiamNashy awh thanks !  You too ! 
23	 @ LiamNashy magazine journalism ,  Im in my final year so its got proper hard now .  Its all multimedia now not just magazines  :  / 
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy hahaha oh you ! 
23	So now Im probably gonna get a low mark because Ill have to do my back up plan . 
23	And the people I was meant to be doing it on arent answering any of my messages and have no phone number apparently . 
23	Also ,  I am FREAKING OUT about the uni work I have to do over the holidays .  .  .  I dont have the right programmes for this shit  :  ( 
23	This week I need to finish my Christmas shopping .  .  . 
23	See what I did there ?  Cross the road ?  Crossroads ?  SEE YOU AT DA CROSSROADS CROSSROADS
23	Remember Blazin Squad ?  Eeeeee .  If youd seen them lot in the street youd cross the road out of fear they were gonna heckle and mug you .

23	Shes learned to take the piss out of herself though .  Theres a few cracks in there at Friday
23	So Rebecca Black has released another song .  .  .  Called Saturday .  I shit you not . 
23	Cant wait to be done with uni so I can pursue what I actually want to do in life . 
23	It genuinely upsets me that I cant be her . 
23	I am in love with Jennifer Lawrence .  Shes so down to earth yet so talented ,  and she actually looks like a woman and not a rake . 
23	 @ millieme0w Im off for Christmas now  :  )  so whenever ! 
23	 @ millieme0w awwh yissss hair lessons !   : D
23	Wish I could do all these fancy plaits .  Like fish tail and French and dutch .  I can only do the bog standard !   :  ( 
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy well exactly !  Haha you get it .  You should watch them theyre fantastic !  As are the books if youre into reading  :  ) 
23	 @ zydrate _ anatomy hes from The Hunger Games haha  : P hes played by Liam Hemsworth
23	AND I KNOW THEYRE THE SAME PERSON .  .  .  I know what I mean and thats what matters . 
23	But dont get me wrong ,  I wouldnt kick Liam Hemsworth out of bed either ,  its just Gale is brawny . 
23	Had a dream I got pregnant to Gale Hawthorne .  Not Liam Hemsworth ,  Gale Hawthorne .  That is an extremely important factor .  Mmm yummy . 
23	 @ LiamNashy oh god Im sorry !  I thought I was the only one behind !  I got it spoiled for me too so I know the feeling !  Scroll away !  Haha

23	The disease and not to mention the amount of times walkers have broken the fence down . 
23	I love how The Governor is trying to take the prison because its safe .  .  we all know it isnt safe .  Come on . 
23	Finally watching the mid season finale .  Even though its already been ruined for me !   # TWD
23	Amount of time it takes The Governor to rehabilitate and go crazy again :  1 and a half episodes . 
23	 @ hm is like Yey !  Online sale !  But then they charge you 4 quid delivery and thats where they get you . 
23	Havent needed my internet all day  =  has been working fine .  Need it now  =  keeps disconnecting .  Typical . 
23	 @ TheHungerGames Catching fire was absolutely fantastic !  It stayed so true to the book !  .  .  .  Which Im going to start reading again .  .  .
