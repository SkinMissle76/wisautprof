-0.64	Despite a controversial 3rd goal against Australia ,  we stormed to a 4 - 1 win .  Another remarkable performance from Chile
-0.64	Had to come back from 2 - 0 down to scrap a draw in the 88th minute against a surprisingly strong Swiss side
-0.64	We put the hard work in and came out on top ,  3 - 1
-0.64	Ive got Spain next in stickman soccer ,  going to be a tough round

-0.64	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 thats got nothing to do with whether someone supports a team or not though
-0.64	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 you shouldnt be so controversial is youre not looking for a nibble then davo
