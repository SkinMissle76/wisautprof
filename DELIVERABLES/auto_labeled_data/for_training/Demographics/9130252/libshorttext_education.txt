2	 @ flybe BE961 to LGW delayed almost 4hrs ,  yet all other airlines LHR / LGW flights unaffected .   " Operational "  reasons ?  Cost saving more like . 
2	Only a few more hours before Apple make my svelte iPad 3 feel like this .  .  .  
2	 " Outsourced "  ,   " Enterprise "  ,   " Fixed Price "  ,   " RFP "  ,   " Resources "   -  each term takes you one step closer to the software project Pit of Despair
2	Not often you get to see  " enterprise "  software project problems played out in public ,  but this is all pretty common .  
2	Consolidating 100s of JIRA issues into a nice readable set of release documentation is no fun .  Lesson learnt :  Release early ,  release often ! 
2	GitHubs management strategy is one every IT company should aspire to .  So many great concepts .  
2	 @ NTCastleWard The high chairs in your café are terrible .  The trays are broken on them all .  Not family friendly !  Trip to IKEA sometime ? 
2	 @ maxieduncan finally !  TouchID is rather neat but the button feels a bit clicky . 
2	 " He screamed  " Ive had the time of my life "  and continued to dance and run around the stage "  Ballmers stylish exit .  
2	Interesting read about iOS app pricing for kids ,  parents and the convenience option for a few minutes peace !

2	 @ poseidongroove Quantity not quality is all that they care about where the business model is bums - on - seats
2	 @ opentrail Same with my 4S although I wonder is it because Ive been playing with new features a lot ?  My iPad 3 battery seems worse too . 
2	Very detailed write up of Safari changes  ( and bugs )  in iOS 7 
2	So iOS7 has changed the English ( UK )  Siri voice from grumpy Roger Moore into grumpy Roger Moore with a bad cold . 
2	 " From hells heart I stab at thee ;  for hates sake I spit my last breath at thee "  .  Every software developer forced to work with Flex .  Ever . 
2	ATMs  -   " Unable to provide a receipt .  Do you wish to continue "   :   " NO !  "   -  Nobody .  Ever . 
2	Vivaldi Four Seasons : Recomposed by  @ maxrichtermusic  -  truly exquisite .  Every listen to Spring 1 cannot fail to brighten your day . 
2	Interesting write up the history of Android and Googles distancing itself from it .   
2	Also dont see why the second - screen content needs to be media if any HTML content can be cast .  Plenty of retail / ecom opportunity here .

2	 " No pressure ,  right ?  "  Ill add 51 .  Zero latency synchronised multi room AirPlay support too  :  )  
2	The REST API in ATG10 . 2 is much improved ,  but disappointing that it only wraps the decrepit FormHandler / Droplet layer .  Opportunity missed . 
2	 @ opentrail … and the consumption model is different .  Wiki is consumed on the web .  GDocs often exported as PDF / Word and consumed via email . 
2	 @ opentrail I see a wiki as a collection of small interlinked docs ,  whereas a Google Doc is a single self - contained doc not interlinked . 
2	“ @ ATG _ Support :  Where can I find Amacis Visibility / Communication Centre documentation ?   ( Doc ID .  1036519 . 1 )  
2	Why accessibility matters for mobile  - where the screen reader  * is *  the mobile device .

2	Responsive must be the most overused and misunderstood term in ecommerce development right now . 
2	 " How do I get my Ajax  _  _  _  working ?  "   Get your non - Ajax  _  _  _  working first !  Remarkable how robust progressive enhancement continues to be . 
2	Northern Ireland tourism milking the Game of Thrones connection .  Nicely done though !  
2	 " Management only exists to compensate for its own poor hiring decisions "  .  Key to this is great people ,  zero bozos .  
2	Bit of snow at Gatwick .  Flight in 10 mins early .  Trains :  fucked ! 
2	 @ AerLingus mobile check in  -  an app that wraps a site that sends an email that links to the site that shows an image .   # Appsturbation
2	 " Sony reinvents the phone "   -  2007 called .  It wants the future back .  
2	 " 1 items "   =  =  lazy programmer  |  |  code written on a Friday afternoon .  Often both .

2	 @ poseidongroove Nice .  Reckon youll struggle to get those jammed in your ears though .  .  .   ;  ) 
2	 @ ThreeUK The 1990s called  -  they want your WAPtastic mobile credit card payment forms back . 
2	By my count its T - minus 2 days for Apple to release iTunes 11 before somebody else gets Forstalled
2	 " Profile changes in your network "  aka  " Whose leaving party are you going to be attending soon " 
2	So the Skyfall theme is 90 %  Lana del Rey ,  10 %  John Barry ,  with Adeles name on it ?

2	 @ poseidongroove  This is very much in line with your omni channel ecommerce vision .

2	Where would technology documentary makers be without the Tron : Legacy soundtrack ? 
2	IKEA stock alert email :   " Dear customer , Your product ( s )  has / have arrived .  "   # selfassemblyofifstatementrequired
2	Shocked to discover that O2 is the only network in the UK that supports iPhone Visual Voicemail .  Switched to 3 and now no VV . 
2	Great summary of responsive vs separate mobile site considerations .  Nice term  -   " aggressive enhancement "  .  
2	Its a veritable updatefest tonight ! 
2	Tim Cook tries too hard to do passionate and sincere .  Clear the limestone used for Barcelona store wasnt keeping him awake .   # imisssteve
2	Tim Cook ,  May 2012  :   " Were doubling down on secrecy "  .  Well that sure worked out great .  
2	 @ cmore Nice work .  Great to see improvements like this .  Nucleus  & amp ;  core ATG neglected for far too long . 
2	 @ worksykes Time to resurrect Live Chat .  Again ?   ( bout time for a new chat co acquisition isnt it ?  )

2	Newspaper sites of the world :  No  -  I do not want to download your shitty iPad app .  Just your website please .  Kthxbye . 
2	I find Resources a vulgar word when applied to building software .  Belies a lack of appreciation of the creative effort expended by People . 
2	The first time one uses ATG 10 . 1 ,  one is greeted with a dialog written by The Queen .  Must be a diamond jubilee thing .  
2	 @ maxieduncan bloody ASCII art fairies at it again ! 
2	Why hello The Future .  Nice to meet you .  
2	Android is open .   
2	Wow !  My JSON JSP taglib just went past 20 , 000 downloads .  Still no escape from enterprise JSP dev for lots of folk !  
2	 @ poseidongroove I cant believe the attention this nonsense has got in the mainstream media .  Its a video .  No shipping code or product ! 
2	The dopey Google Project Glass video is missing Tom Cruise swooping in to arrest the guy for future crimes against ukulele playing
2	Im fast coming to the conclusion that agile software development is 99 %  bullshit and 1 %  smart people simply getting stuff done
2	Amazing public Q & A session with BT on reddit .  Inspirational stuff .   
2	Google +  in a nutshell .  .  " social is people and the people are on Facebook "

2	ATGs near biennial build - or - buy another chat product strategy continues into the Oracle era !  
2	 " Siri ,  call me My Lord "   " OK .  What can I help you with ,  My Lord ?  " 
2	 @ worksykes I think has HUGE potential .  New services ,  actions ,  3rd party access via an API .  Think original iPhone sans apps compared to now . 
2	Jeez ,  even the time is too much for Siri in UK .   # SiriUKUselessness 
2	Siri failing to see the irony  # SiriUKUselessness 
2	Siri is a bit disappointing in UK  -  can only search businesses and maps in USA .  Siris voice in UK is classic Roger Moore though !

2	Great presentation from  @ jonjenk to wrap up  # awssummit  -  how Amazon . com migrated to AWS ,  which was created independently .  Dogfood eaten .

2	At AWS Summit London .  Ironically not a cloud in the sky this morning .   # awssummit
2	Really impressed with Apples WWDC announcements .  A feast of rock solid incremental improvements .  Game Center the only meh moment ! 
2	UK ecommerce just keeps on growing 
2	Loving the Roger Hargreaves doodles on the Google homepage today .  Looks like most of the characters are there if you hit refresh enough ! 
2	Recruiters :   " XXX would love you to join  _ there _  team "  does not convey the professionalism you are trying to solicit .   # BackToEnglishClass
2	 @ jpsykes apparently Mommy  &  Daddys party bag business has tripled in value solely thanks to its new royal association too .
