-1	Now I understand why no one else is using RX on Mono for Android !  Someone needs to implement the platform specific schedulers .  Hmm . 
-1	Guy sat next to me on train was hacking some c #  .  Got chatting about the future of wpf etc .  He also thinks html / JS is inevitable .  Damn . 
-1	 @ Coppermill Awesome .  Just installed it .  Ill give that a go .  Obviously not as good as being able to see the app Im debugging and VS2012 . 
-1	 @ AwkwardCoder Just2let u know ,  I avoid scores to watch highlights in the evening  -  so Im trying not to infer anything from your 2 words !
