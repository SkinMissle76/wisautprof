-0.6	 @ thisisdavid Im now looking at the Chindõgu entry on Wikipedia .  Its amazing .  
-0.6	 @ sorobotic  * beams *  I know my lot in life ,  and act accordingly . 
-0.6	Once again ,  I flipping loved  # Sherlock ,  and Ill thank you to leave my opinion to be mine ,  and not tell me how much you all hated it . 
-0.6	 @ AllyFarrell I hope it was worth the wait ? 
-0.6	 @ peacockgamble to take them out of the tank ,  wrap them in tin foil and refrigerate them so theyd not rot before I could bury them .   ( 2 / 2 )

-0.6	The fact that my best presents this year were a sugar bowl with tongs and cupcake kits mean Im officially grown up . 
-0.6	 @ jameshamilton TELL THE PUG I SAY HI THANK YOU . 
-0.6	Firestarter .  
-0.6	 @ peacockgamble In a blaze of glory .  Literally .  A fire after a sold out show at the O2 ,  taking the whole audience with you . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic  " Reduced due to damage " 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton Its amazing . 
-0.6	 @ AllyFarrell It finally arrived then ? 
-0.6	 @ mirandafay Completely !  I shall inevitably be re - watching said episode tomorrow ,  screaming . 
-0.6	 @ Pretty _ Wrong This is amazing . 
-0.6	 @ SophieHaII It kind of summed up everything I love about the show ,  which is why I find it so funny when people slate it . 
-0.6	 @ crowleeey If that comes with age ,  then Im terrifyingly old before my time . 
-0.6	 @ crowleeey Im waiting until I graduate before I get into The Wire .  Mainlining Breaking Bad last term was nearly the end of me . 
-0.6	Jump Scare .  
-0.6	Already done some festive ironing and managed to get a festive burn .  MERRY CHRISTMAS . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic Oh ,  you .  Hush your mouth .  x
-0.6	 @ hoodedhawks It was their most recent single ,  so it may well be a tribute to said track .  The actual Bastille version is pretty good ! 
-0.6	 @ crowleeey If thats not fantastic advice ,  then I dont know what is . 
-0.6	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ TheAzzo  " Why does the woman HAVE to be a secretary ?  Why cant she be a Doctor ?  "  Because sometimes women are secretaries ,  no ? 
-0.6	 @ crowleeey Ive come to accept that by September I have to officially be a  " grown up "  as thats when Ill have graduated .  Still scary . 
-0.6	Guys ,  Im serious .  Its about Martians invading Germany .  What has happened to the History Channel ? 
-0.6	 @ TheAzzo Proud of you . 
-0.6	 @ hoodedhawks They did 2 mix tapes with covers worked into their own tracks  & amp ;  peppered them with film quotes .  Can send them over if you like ? 
-0.6	 @ TNeenan  @ EdGambleComedy I hate to give a Boots employee insight into this ,  but we sell a fair bit  -  I put about 4 bottles through today . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic Swollen . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic Youre in luck . 
-0.6	 @ vairi Shes so pretty .   * cries * 
-0.6	IRONICALLY ,  I SHOULD STRESS .   # Splash
-0.6	 @ KatieMcCullough I have no doubt that youll find something brilliant  -  you deserve a job that you love and get praised for . 
-0.6	 @ crowleeey I was the same ,  but I think some people needed reassurance that 60 +  episodes were definitely worth their time . 
-0.6	EXCITED .   # sherlocklives
-0.6	GUYS ,  I TURNED DOWN A SAMPLE FROM A HOT BOY IN HOTEL CHOCOLAT .  I AM A CHANGED WOMAN . 
-0.6	Remember that time they dropped Perry on his head ?   # Splash
-0.6	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ TheAzzo But yeah ,  it just makes me feel like my own opinions are wrong ,  which is ridiculous . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic That means Ive become tragically predictable .   * sobs * 
-0.6	 @ amantimusic Of course ,  its all appreciated . 
-0.6	 @ peacockgamble My fish  ( Bubble  & amp ;  Squeak )  died a week apart .  Both died overnight ,  so we found them before I had to go to school .  We had  ( 1 / 2 ) 
-0.6	I might learn to roller - skate this year rather than ride a bike .   [ Insert pithy comment to hide the fact this is just me thinking aloud .  ] 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic NOW MY FACE MATCHES MY HAIR AND I LOOK LIKE A BALLOON IN PLAID . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic I shall eagerly await your return .  x
-0.6	Hairdryers just essentially blown up .  GOOD .  Good . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic I couldnt resist . 
-0.6	 @ KatieMcCullough Poor bairn .  Lots of cuddles may be part of the prescription .  Mine was lovely ,  thanks !  Nice to spend time with my parents .  x
-0.6	2013 in Review .

-0.6	 @ ashy99 Happy New Year ,  lovely .   ( Ive holed up with Father Ted ,  I cant complain too much !  )

-0.6	Trading Places .  
-0.6	 @ Pretty _ Wrong Evidently youre trendsetting early . 
-0.6	 @ davenewmanexp I cried SO MUCH at that film .  Not even sure why ! 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic Yayyyyyyyy .   [ Insert joke about starting / ending the year with a bang ] 
-0.6	 @ jameshamilton  * whispers *  I think youre going to have to put in some work to beat that last tweet this year .  YOU PEAKED TOO EARLY . 
-0.6	 @ matthewcrosby  " Poirot and Marple ?  He CLEARLY didnt mean to ask that .  .  .  " 
-0.6	 @ markiddon I preferred it to Love Actually ,  and my delight for that film cannot be shaken . 
-0.6	 @ ivanogo  @ maxolesker I genuinely cheered .  My parents are confused . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic MATE I NEARLY DID A CRY . 
-0.6	No Prizes for Procrastination .  
-0.6	I can already tell that Im going to have a great 2014 ,  as Im doing really well on University Challenge . 
-0.6	 @ amantimusic Because…I…saw something funny at the same time as reading your tweet . 
-0.6	 @ matthewcrosby Makes a change . 
-0.6	 @ stevemcneil If someone had said that about me ,  Id have given them a whack about the face . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic No sweets since the start of the year .  Ive turned into a sulky cow ,  and its awful . 
-0.6	 @ mirandafay Holy moly . 
-0.6	 @ RayPeacock I hope next year is better for you ,  lovely .  You deserve it .  x
-0.6	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton FFS you two . 
-0.6	Sorry ,  but this is the very LAST book Id let my  ( non - existent )  children play with .  Maybe if they… 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic I could lend you mine ,  but time differences are a pain . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic Maybe for your birthday ,  if youre good . 
-0.6	 @ garwboy And some was filmed in Cheltenham too .  So poo poo to all of those people . 
-0.6	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton I look forward to hearing all about it in a routine soon .
