33	 @ simongrant17 Dont forget angry !  😡😡😡
33	 @ simongrant17 Just tackle them !  !  Theyre not doing anything .  .  # Valid
33	Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 .  .  Finally . Long time coming . 
33	 @ markusbartley Its killing you defensively as youre too slow in transition .  Navas  +  Nasri popping up in space where wing backs should be
33	 @ markusbartley Gaffer your shape is killing you . 
33	 @ anettec333 I didnt miss spell  " halve "  though did I .  I chose the wrong word .  Honest mistake . P . S .  Where is your capital letter ?  ☺
33	 @ Michael _ Mooney1 I havent seen enough of him .  Dont think many have .  2 / 3 matches isnt enough to make a fair judgement .  # HartBackSoon
33	Bit awkward when Lennon goes to shake Pantilimons hand .  .  Hell have to reach HIIIIIIGGH ! Look at the size of him next to Hugo !   # Beast
33	Played my first ever game at centre halve this morning .  Conclusion :  I am not a centre halve .  Eh  @ simonb _ 1987  @ jamiew812  ? 
33	 @ JessBuh Awww
33	 @ jonbennett9 I was !  !  Wouldnt have watched it on to the post like that  @ simongrant17 though .   # AllsImSaying  # 🎣
33	 @ jonbennett9 Felt for you today bud .  Keep of that leg for a bit ! 
33	Em route to Rugby with  @ MarlowFC New book taking care of me .  .   # Enke  # GoodRead 
33	 @ simonb _ 1987 Going to have to delay it until tomorrow .  I feel absolutely rotten .  Night Nurse is kicking in .  .  😴Typical timing .  .  😡
33	I am struggling today . Night Nurse needs to help me out big time . This week was suppose to be my come back too .  
33	 @ James _ HWhitty No he isnt ,  although he has been previously .  Pretty sure he missed Readings last few matches due to injury
33	 @ James _ HWhitty  # Precisely
33	Pleased Forster is finally starting .  Give him the whole 90 . Wouldnt bother with Ruddy we have better options . 
33	 @ AndyHoment Ohhh really ?  This is why you dont get iPad privileges .  # AbuseOfTrust
33	 @ simon _  _ tucker  @ BritishGas Swines
33	 @ simonb _ 1987 I was there too .  . You hurt my feelings .  .  # WayToGo
33	 @ AndyHoment Come on then ,  lets have it . How did you do it then ?   # YouHaveMyAttention
33	 @ markusbartley 👌
33	Pretty surprised  @ simonb _ 1987 hasnt been in my ear about seeing this shortly ! 
33	 @ markusbartley Whats the name of our Hungarian friend ?  I need to research this myself .  .  # Baffled
33	Put  @ simongrant17 through his paces tonight  @ MarlowFC  # LoveTraining 
33	 @ simongrant17 No interruptions next week mate .  I promise . 
33	 @ simongrant17 Interesting .  Well talk Thursday .  Ill have a think . 
33	 @ simongrant17 Only way to improve is to keep our standards high .  Ill get you diving Thursday . In a goal for a change ! 
33	 @ simongrant17 Thursday . Sisters birthday last week .  What happened at the weekend ?  What you need to work on ? 
33	Kαλημέρα . 
33	Forster was so unlucky with Dundees goal at the weekend .  Did well to get to it .  Should have started higher though . 
33	 @ rhysyork5 Seriously .  .  .  Is it over yet ? 
33	 @ rhysyork5 I hear that and I second it .  . 
33	 @ Given137 On thats cool ,  fair play .  Sorry for your loss bud . 
33	 @ Given137 Why are you number 24 bud ? 
33	 @ ITV Olympiakos goalkeeper was incredible tonight and you give the game 40 seconds of highlights ?   # WhatAWaste
33	Casillas looks like he wants to give Carlo a headache .  Lopez been in great form but Casillas was class tonight too ! 
33	IKER WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?  ! That was incredible . 
33	Buffon great approach for one v one .  Think he is unlucky .  Stands up and he saves it though . 
33	Nobody saves THAT penalty .  . 
33	And again from Mr Madrid ! 
33	What a save from Iker
33	 @ eddecroos Personally ,  I didnt think Fellainis first booking was a foul .  That Dutch snake has had it too ☺
33	Wow .  .  Are these really Uniteds highlights ? 
33	Little Pea ?  Little high .  . 
33	Feel sorry for Igor .  .  Man City were just far too good tonight !  Didnt have a chance with most of them . 
33	Man Citys 4th was class .  This form is incredible . 
33	Costel just got SAT down !  Hart would have saved it .  .  .  🐠
33	Unlucky with the third .  Reads the game well .  Great ball from Aguero though .  Too good . 
33	Aguero is so so good .  Pace best Akinfeev . 
33	Akinfeev ,  whatever happened to his potential ?  Havent heard about him in years ! 
33	ΟΛΥ 1 - 0 Benfica PSG 10 ,  Olympiacos 7 -  Benfica 4 ,  Anderlecht 1 .  3 points vs Anderlecht in Game 6 will do for Oly though @ simon _  _ tucker
33	 @ ChrisAndre6 Its okay ,  my boy Zlatan has levelled it up ! 
33	 @ FindingCotton Love that man ! 
33	 @ ChrisAndre6 Not ideal .  . 
33	Forget  @ juventusfc and  @ realmadrid  @ olympiacos _ org are beating  @ SL _ Benfica  # ΠΑΜΕΘΡΥΛΟΣ  # ΟΛΥΜΠΙΑΚΟΣ
33	 @ BethGoalkeeper1 Have you seen the BBCs two ,  three episode series of Sherlock with Benedict ? 
33	 @ GK _ Dawson Love it . I may have to copy this ! 
33	 @ BethGoalkeeper1 Have you read any of Sir Arthurs Holmes books or just a RDJ fan ? 
33	 @ RossiAustin Only takes one injury .  Iker knows the feeling .  Depends on his drive .  Valdes is playing brilliantly now .  May not get back in . 
33	 @ RossiAustin Na .  Cant see that happening .  Casillas is Madrid .  Valdes has only just started to replace him in Spain squad 11 months later .
