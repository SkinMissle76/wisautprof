29	 @ TimonySouler Please do  -  especially before Xmas Day !  Gnight
29	Ugh .  Been a long time since Ive been up this early .  Not sure kitten will appreciate it when he realises though . 
29	Have to get ready for work in a minute .  Another long day .  So tired though
29	For only 6 - 7 months ,  Barley is such a big cat .  I dread to think how big hell get
29	 @ susiesaurus I raise you four days  =  / 
29	So even if I did ring  & amp ;  say how ill I am it just seems like Im lying .  Who can measure the pain inside your own head ?   # hatemigraines
29	 @ tmycann Lol .  But when he says hes old ,  its hard to pretend differently
29	Postman has about ten minutes or Im going out .  Realise theyre busy but Ive got stuff to do ! 
29	Judging by the purring ,  paddling and kisses .  Kitten has forgiven me for yesterdays vet trip
29	Really wish I could help my Bear with his work troubles .  Hate seeing him angry and down over people not worth his pain  =  / 
29	Watching  # lasttangoinhalifax  & amp ;  getting a bit of  # amediting done . 
29	Getting ready for work time .  My eye still looks bloodshot ,  though .   =  / 
29	My eyes are so very tired .  Have work soon ,  though .  Hair is in bunches again ,  but so far today no more head trauma .   # crossesfingers
29	May have a shower and see if the water pressure will help ease the tension and pain in my scalp .   # gottotrysomething
29	And a day .  Thought it was Sunday tomorrow but its not .  Boo
29	Why is it so cold ?  ! 
29	Decided I hate whoever set off the entire block of flats fire alarms at this time of night  -  probably with burnt .  .  .  
29	 @ DeanBemrose Just change your password
29	Hellz yeah .  
29	 @ NALGames Lol .  I do still keep tabs on what all you guys are up to ,  even if I dont always find the time to talk to you  ;  )

29	Run Down But  # Lucky :  Maybe biting off a little more than I can chew whilst… 
29	Cant wait to see what books Im getting for Christmas !  
29	When you kiss your lovely boyfriend and he pushes you away with the words ,   " Back off a second ,  "  and then just .  .  .  
29	 @ Scath  :  (  Is he taking any fluids ? 
29	No longer have to go to work but still not feeling right
29	 @ tmycann Not really but not much I can do .  Just hard to de - stress  & amp ;  stave off migraines when coming home to someonein such a bad mood  =  /
