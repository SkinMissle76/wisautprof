-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ BoycottJerry  @ nfl not in Dallas you mean
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus I am reading online there are changes going to be made with regards to assistant coaches have you heard anything
-1	 @ VancityManpurse  @ RapSheet  @ AdamHBeasley could be worst look at the browns and look my Cowboys we been rebuilding since 1997 with No GM
-1	 @ BenRogers  @ MattBarrieESPN no it the talent on this team that has to get better and it starts by drafting and not missing on draft picks
-1	 @ jonmorosi  @ FOXSports1 have a feeling you will be reporting by noon today the lions will be firing their head coach
-1	 @ JasonLaCanfora you sound surprised that unusual from a well run organization like the Redskins .  .  .  I almost said this with straight face
-1	 @ NFLosophy  @ gregauman you think he is regretting his decision to sign in Tampa
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl I dont .  diets are temporary changing eating habits and life style Changes are better long term
-1	 @ VancityManpurse  @ RapSheet  @ AdamHBeasley If the GM goes I would think the entire staff is gone then your talking about a rebuild
-1	 @ RapSheet  @ AdamHBeasley I would say dolphins are looking for a new OC
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ 5KStone  @ tovash10 you have to draft well
-1	 @ RealStevenJames I am not sure who does either but I watch the draft coverage and can see that JJ like to gamble a lot trade up  /  down
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ ScottPrivott and at his age and lack of production this year the trade value is nothin more than likely takes a pay cut
-1	 @ RealStevenJames true Jerry is going to have to change his thinking and give the draft more priority and listen to his player development
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ RealStevenJames then supplement your roster thru free agency
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ RealStevenJames even with those cuts I dont see them being major players in free agency .  .  .  You have to build through draft
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ RealStevenJames Austin and Carr I heard Ware is willing to take a pay cut to stay
-1	 @ calvinwatkins he may want to think about it because his defense stunk all year
-1	 @ coopmavs actually they may want to watch  # 14 of the  # Stars
-1	8 - 8 is a miracle with the lack of talent on this team
-1	Ball game bad int by Orton
-1	 @ Twerley62 I hate to keep saying this but Cowboys defense needs to make a big play
-1	Big play by 88
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ DrewPearsonShow it was a dumb play call a roll out with Orton
-1	cowboys season in the balance on this drive have to get a touchdown
-1	 @ JJT _ ESPNDallas problem is that the cowboys offense has is lacking in the red zone and having to settle for field goals
-1	Cowboys need to hold Eagles to a field goal a touchdown here and could be game over
-1	Cowboys team MVP will be Dan Bailey
-1	 # 57 on Cowboys defense has been nice find
-1	They go for it on 4 and 1 and that the play they call not sure that could play call with Orton in at QB
-1	 @ Twerley62 are you surprised that we have still not seen any play action
-1	Witten limping off the field time for rest of the offense to setup
-1	 @ Twerley62 especially with the cowboys fan base they are like the Yankees expect championships or bust
-1	 @ Twerley62 this team has not quit on Garrett have been fighting
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ Browns not to mention the ownership situation is a little sticky
-1	 @ newyscruggs and that why the have run through head coaches like I run through dt cokes
-1	Dallas defense has look really good tonight and another 3 and out Cowboys with a chance to take the lead on there next possession
-1	Have to settle for three after the turnover that could come back and haunt the team
-1	Cowboys offense needs a touchdown here
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon still should have been going
-1	Nice play by Dallas defense just what we needed
-1	 @ Twerley62 been surprised on how they have kept McCoy bottled up
-1	 @ Twerley62 agreed
-1	 @ Twerley62 defense has been a nice surprise Monty has stepped up on his play calls
-1	 @ Twerley62 so far the offense has look Good like to see some play action deep down the field
-1	Another Hard count gets the eagles off sides
-1	big stop for  # Cowboys  defense
-1	Start of 2nd half real important if  @ dallascowboys want to stay in the game
-1	 @ TimCowlishaw  @ Edwerderespn maybe they were thinking about going for it on 4th down
-1	 @ JasonLaCanfora they may want to also look at the fact that they dont have a QB or a RB
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon that should have been caught
-1	 @ Twerley62 agreed
-1	 @ Twerley62 man on a mission  # 29 in beast mode and give the o - line some props has some nice holes to run through like to see some playaction
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ Browns  @ BlueStarBlog might need a big drink instead of a hug
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ Browns  @ JayGlazer which organization is more dis functional Browns or Cowboys
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon no still a bust one nice play doesnt make a career
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl tonight might be the last time we see him in a  # Cowboys  jersey
-1	 @ Twerley62 nice leap from # 89
-1	 @ BenRogers is tonight the last time we see Myles Austin in a  # Cowboys jersey
-1	 @ AdamSchefter  @ mortreport which organization is more dysfunctional  # Browns or  # Cowboys
-1	 @ JJT _ ESPNDallas first D -  Ware sighting of the season
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon Tim its a process we are trying to win in all three phases of the game .  .  .  .  .  Lol
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl why not I have already started myself
-1	 @ darrenrovell NO ,  NO ,  NO
-1	 @ calvinwatkins to make things interesting .  .  .  Considering I did not know they were going this way with it means it didnt work
-1	 @ calvinwatkins bailey ,  hatcher maybe got snubbed the rest considering who made it ahead of them not really
-1	 @ sbass1310 I know right best part of the movie coming up
-1	 @ SportsSturm its a wonderful life also deserves a movie review as well
-1	 @ newyscruggs yes but only if he replaces himself as GM changing Head Coach does no good unless you clean house
-1	 @ SportsSturm had D - ware pressure the QB all season entire defense has M . I . A all year
-1	 @ iamelf I think he is gone either way they dont win or lose today next week against the eagles they have no chance of winning
-1	 @ calvinwatkins did he make the trip ? 
-1	 @ bhorn55 I think we all been asking that question all season
-1	1st down redskins thats ball game
-1	 @ CashSports lol thats funny
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon I guess that all Jerry wants
-1	 @ Edwerderespn I dont think the left foot was down
-1	 @ DavidMooreDMN I dont think its going to happen either way
-1	Can you hear that sound that the Cowboys season being flushed down the drain and hopefully the entire front office and coaching staff
-1	 @ aandro and also spring training just around the corner
-1	 @ Twerley62 M . I . A all season long
-1	 @ BenRogers turn in you playbook
-1	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 over / under on how long Garrett and the coaching staff are fired after the game
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ RiverJordan3  @ clarencehilljr under
-1	 @ newbury1310 that would require the cowboys to be creative with their play calls .  .  .  Plus the smart thing to day cowboys are neither
-1	 @ mattmosley I guess 50 million dollars doesnt get much in the NFL just a below average player
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl yes
-1	 @ BenRogers close is still a question mark I would love for them to get Balfour at 2 for 15
-1	 @ MikeBacsik not yet still uneasy about the bullpen
-1	 @ benjihana  @ JonHeymanCBS merry Christmas Texas Rangers fans
-1	 @ calvinwatkins to bad cowboys dont subscribe to this philosophy
-1	 @ SportsDayDFW I think Drew Pearson should  # theoriginal88
-1	 @ Twerley62 thanks you too
-1	 @ Twerley62 same here have Reggie Bush on my team
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ danny24fan  @ BradChadwick a lack of talent on this team goes back to bad drafts .  Look and learn from the NE Patriots
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ jimjoyz talent is not everything guys like zack Thomas were always told they were too slow ,  too small . 
-1	 @ Twerley62 rational football minds also seem to be scarce at Valley Ranch for the last 17 years
-1	 @ Twerley62 nothin would change except the name plate by the head coaches office .  .  .  Just like the Oakland Raiders under  Al Davis
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus  @ dallasbhinson53 can we say another bad decision by the GM
-1	 @ EsqNamedDrew  @ BenRogers nope they didnt notice he was there
-1	 @ gfraley  @ Twerley62 who else would draft Gavin Escobar and pass on Eddie Lacey .  .  .  .  Jerry jones the root of all bad personal decisions
-1	 @ TicketRadio here is another one Cowboys draft Gavin Escobar and pass on Eddie Lacy .  .  ,  who was more productive today ? 
-1	 @ NFLCharean  @ newyscruggs does it really matter its the same result either way
-1	 @ TicketRadio what for baseball season only 62 days till spring training starts
-1	 @ gfraley very true I guess we are now the Oakland Raiders of the NFC run one head coach after another with same result 8 - 8  ,  7 - 9
-1	 @ gfraley not always the head coach fault this starts at the top Jerry jones is the only one who has been around over the last 17 years
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ dallascowboys 7 - 9 would be my bet
-1	 @ iamelf a lot probably the best QB they will face in the last 3 or 4 weeks could be a long day for cowboys defense
-1	 @ espn _ durrett actually not really the coverage Green Bay was in Beasley was correct romo misread the coverage
-1	 @ mattmosley it was Austin this time
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl cant fix stupid
-1	 @ theoldgreywolf nope
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon dont count on McCarthy know what he is doing unlike Garrett and the cowboys
-1	“ @ newyscruggs :  I guess everybody but the guy who went to Princeton thinks they should run the ball .   # Cowboys”
-1	 @ coopmavs no cowboys think they are smarter then anyone else in the league
-1	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 I am glad someone else had notice that the cowboys have only ran the ball 17 times in a game they were up by 21 at one point
-1	 @ newyscruggs their is always way remember these are the Cowboys finding new and impressive ways to lose a game
-1	 @ bhorn55 Kyle Wilber
-1	 @ iamelf Mack brown will stay no one better out there
-1	 @ nickeatman  @ newyscruggs I guess 50 million dollars doesnt get much in todays NFL
-1	 @ BenRogers no longer buying season tickets
-1	 @ aandro probably Choo and Morales the only ones I would say could help
-1	 @ Evan _ P _ Grant what about Choo I hear Yankees are taking a look at his services
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon just burnt out 50 million dollar corner
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus is it just me but a weird game giants lead in time of possession ,  total yards but trail 14 -  6 Cowboys offense still bad
-1	 @ MikeHeika what the deal .  I was reading that Vernon Fiddler has requested a trade ? 
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon how about the excuses for the GM who hired all the coaches
-1	 @ RapSheet no just lucky
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon yea right
-1	 @ SportsDayDFW  @ MikeHeika yes like Alex Goligoski
-1	 @ NFLosophy hey they are beating the teams on there schedule jags only won two games last year and they cant buy a win this year
-1	 @ SkinWade I would say 15
-1	 @ TicketRadio Jerry jones will say that this was a moral victory because AP didnt get 391 yards on the ground against are defense
-1	 @ benjihana  @ EveryDaysAnOdeh watch  # stars hockey a lot more enjoyable
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl yes yes yes same old cowboys
-1	 @ Edwerderespn they are playing the cowboys the Vikings will still win this game
-1	 @ bctc100  @ ThatSportsGirl note as long as Jerry Jone is owner and GM we are now the Al Davis Oakland raiders
-1	 @ ThatSportsGirl only the cowboys could make a 1 - 6 team look like a 6 - 1 team
-1	 @ newyscruggs  @ NFLCharean its a lost season already doesnt really matter
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon Cowboys finding new and improbable was to lose games since 1997
-1	 @ BryanBroaddus so they can go three and out and punt .  .  .  Vikings return the punt for a touchdown to put the game out of reach
-1	 @ SportsSturm at least there is good hockey game going so us at home can watch a team that plays hard  # Stars
-1	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 score update the best team in Dallas  # Stars are leading 2 - 0 over Ottawa
-1	 @ MikeDoocyFox4 now which team is 1 - 6 the Vikings look like the better team cowboys look like the 1 - 6 team
-1	 @ newyscruggs not much to say after a performance like that this year defense looks worst than last years
-1	 @ Slatersnews just another 8 - 8 season
-1	 @ espn _ macmahon I didnt realize he was playing havent seen him out in the field a whole lot
-1	 @ NFLosophy who cant win the big games
