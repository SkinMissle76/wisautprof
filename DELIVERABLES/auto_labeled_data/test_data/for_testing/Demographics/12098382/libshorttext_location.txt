9	 @ hannahHJC I‚Äôm in Bath and all we‚Äôve got is flashy clouds so far .  You got some forks of lightning in Brizzle ? 
9	 @ JDOsman1 Where are you based ?  I‚Äôm in Bath and lots of flashing but no thunder or forks of lightning . 
9	For once I‚Äôm glad of a sleepless night .  Enjoying watching the lightning over Bath ,  haven‚Äôt seen any ground strikes yet though .

9	 @ JennyTurnerPR Wrong Peter Lewis methinks !   :  ) 
9	 @ robinpfoster  @ mattpfoster Maybe it‚Äôs the wrong event to highlight it ,  but I was interested to see influence that a local Twitter acc .  has . 
9	 @ robinpfoster  @ mattpfoster Maybe it is the viral phenomenon ,  maybe I‚Äôm just a ‚Äòsheep‚Äô ,  but I still found both events interesting . 
9	 @ robinpfoster  @ mattpfoster It‚Äôs very similar to that woman who wanted to drive her car down Milsom Street .  There was a vast overreaction . 
9	 @ mattpfoster just goes to show how influential  @ WeLoveBath actually is .  rather impressive really
