17	 @ SynapticFlare Yeah ,  read it on the train this morning and it really struck a chord . 
17	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers Yes ,  that’s what I said ;  SMS authorisation is the example ,  but once permission’s given it could be used for more . 
17	 @ Glinner Despite it being quite simple / easy ,  its the game Ive thought about most this year .  Already played it twice . 
17	 @ dstorey  @ thebabydino 
17	Ooh ,  Gimp’s had an OSX makeover .  Not 100 %  Retina yet ,  but looks  * much *  better than previously .  
17	Or it might have been Oblivion by Grimes .  Or was that 2012 ? 
17	 @ paddycarey My email ,  calendar ,  social networks ,  banking ,  etc ,  all done through the browser .  Without internet ,  hardware worth nothing . 
17	Exchanging social data  -  3 questions : What will you do with it ? What benefit do I get from it ? How can I delete it when Im done ? 
17	People who complain that Chromebooks are a brick without Wifi miss the point ;  it’s like complaining that a car doesn’t move without petrol .

17	 @ thebabydino  @ dstorey My tweet about Christmas should be read through the lens of the one preceding it .

17	 @ KellySibson  @ gothick 
17	 @ jaffathecake 
17	Cat loves Christmas .  
17	Watching Snoop Dogg’s “Who Am I ? ” ,  feeling nostalgic for a time when rap videos were about turning into a Doberman  & amp ;  leading a comedy chase .

17	A Bitcoin FAQ :  
17	That’s MISTER  *  | FNAME |  *  to you .  
17	 @ tdh I think they are inevitable ,  but none on the market now have really nailed the opportunity yet .  Looking forward to them doing so . 
17	 @ donovanh 50k +  per month ,  perhaps .  The higher ,  the better . 
17	Dear  @ verge ,  why must this be described as a Siri and Google Now “killer” ?  Why not simply a  * competitor *  ?  
17	My 2013  @ ThisIsMyJam Odyssey ;  19 tracks that I liked this year .  
17	IE11 is now being reported correctly by  @ googleanalytics .  
17	 @ benrmatthews  @ Glinner Alternatively… 
17	 @ marcustucker I think they do ,  but have never been offline yet . 
17	 @ brucel Im more like a Peckham Aldi comedian . 
17	Good to see smart TV makers focusing on HTML apps rather than proprietary platforms ,  but I’m still unconvinced smart TV has a future . 
17	 @ donovanh I’ll try to avoid the tech blog skew for now ,  get some broader public numbers .  Thanks for the offer ,  though ,  may get back to you . 
17	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers Not because of FB per se ,  but because I use it very lightly and don’t feel comfortable granting this permission . 
17	On a total pop ladies  @ VEVO binge .  Beyonce ,  Lady Gaga ,  Whitney Houston .  I am immune to your judgement . 
17	 @ AxentePaul 
17	That said ,  perhaps they should redesign Beats by Dre to leak less sound .  In my informal study ,  second - worst culprit after Apple earphones . 
17	 @ dstorey If you use Handlebars / Mustache frequently ,  youre fairly obliged to . 
17	 @ arseblog So many ways I could reply to that ,  but I’ll keep a straight face and say yes ,  definitely .  Could you add me  ( gmail )  as a user ? 
17	 @ dstorey  @ VEVO Nah ,  thats a totally different vibe . 
17	Damn it ,  slept late and completely missed the latest Twitter mob . 
17	Alicia Keys has left her role as Global Creative Director at Blackberry !  This is like Steve Jobs leaving Apple !  
17	What dinosaur mummified the girl ?  The veloci - wrapped - her .   # dinosnores
17	Tablet use on  @ BBCiPlayer overtook desktop for the first time on Christmas Day :  
17	Ha ha haaa !  Dobby the Elf ! 
17	 @ philstuart Really enjoyed that ,  but his lack of fame is less mysterious when you know he was a massive smackhead . 
17	“Amazing never before seen easter egg” ,  or “detail in the film you might have missed” .  
17	 @ prehensile I don’t get why it’s an option at all .  How can it be wrong to learn about ‘respect for a partner’ ? 
17	 @ brucel Some info on that in the link ,  and more on the DVD extras . 
17	The latest  @ WiredUK is the best in ages  -  probably due to reduced startup hagiography and more focus on tech ,  data ,  and design . 
17	Sketch idea for a 2013 review show :  satire of Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” ,  sung by badgers with the words changed to “Cull Me Maybe” . 
17	Happy New Year !  My resolution is to try to impose more of my arbitrary moral values on you ,  as if they were some kind of universal absolute ! 
17	NYE at Somerset House .   @  Somerset House 
17	The  @ Independent are writing about ‘Blue Monday’ again .  Wasn’t this demolished a few years ago in The  @ Guardian ?  
17	 @ SuperStanners BTW ,  dreamt that you were loudly slagging me off in the pub because of my taste in magazines . 
17	 @ bernardtyers  @ AlecMuffett Depends what they wanted it for ,  what I got in return ,  their data policy ,  and how much I relied on the app . 
17	 @ Pocket Could you look at BBC Good Food recipes ,  e . g .  
17	 @ TheGreasyFringe Paying money to see music I hate doesn’t seem to be a very wise plan . 
17	The only person in the Natural History Museum .   # dinosnores 
17	 @ philstuart Yeah .  Really liked it a lot ,  but dont think it was a classic . 
17	 @ paddycarey Right ,  and if you ever wanted to change to another system much easier to replace XBMC than your TV . 
17	I want to look at some big data .  Who works on a high - traffic site and wants to give me access to their Google Analytics ? 
17	That’s one barrier to Google Glass adoption removed .  
17	 @ jonronson Not fair to blame it on Twitter ;  it was people ,  facilitated by Twitter .  Same as the Arab Spring . 
17	 @ arseblog Got it .  Nice one ,  thanks . 
17	MT  @ DeckerKev Interested in defining the future of web browsers  [ in secret ]  ?  Lets talk .  The Safari team is hiring .  
17	My Top 3  # lastfm Artists :  James Blake  ( 2 )  ,  Nils Frahm  ( 1 )   & amp ;  Louis Futon  ( 1 )  
17	Seems you can use many Google TLDs as a shortcut to your G +  profile .  
17	I’d rather keep TV as a dumb receptacle and do the smart business on mobile devices that are easier to change and upgrade . 
17	The Act of Killing isnt just the best documentary of the year ,  but one of the best Ive ever seen .  Jaw - droppingly phenomenal . 
17	New tech news / reviews site :  
17	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers That permission may be reasonable now ,  but is granted in perpetuity .  I prefer to close that possibility . 
17	Just eaten worm ,  ant ,  pupae ,  cricket ,  and larvae .  Hope I dont get a stomach bug .   # dinosnores  # rimshot
17	I really like Janelle Monae in short bursts ,  but find it hard to maintain interest for a whole album . 
17	Looks like this new update to Facebook for Android means its time to uninstall the app .  
17	 @ perezdavid I prefer to use my phone or tablet to control my TV ,  and not have the apps on the TV itself .  Why do I need  * another *  platform ? 
17	Why I want Bitcoin to die in a fire :  
17	 @ bernardtyers  @ AlecMuffett The example given is SMS authorisation ;  which is fine ,  but only an example ,  could be used for more . 
17	Made a GIF of the scene in the Samsung Gear ad that sums it up perfectly .  
17	I love  @ djearworm’s end of year mashups ;  so much work in there .  Here’s 2013 :  
17	 @ dstorey As so much JS we write does include HTML in strings ,  we single quote by default ,  and use correct punctuation . 
17	What dinosaur will come back on  judgement day ?  The veloci - rapture .   # dinosnores
17	 @ luke161 No .  Why not just buy an 80s VHS transfer for a couple of quid ? 
17	Interesting infographic showing HTC’s Android update process :  
17	I suspect that if I ever bought a smartwatch ,  I would only ever use the clock app . 
17	Think this has gone round before ,  but bears repeating ;  media - influenced opinion vs reality of modern Britain .  
17	Could everyone please stop saying the Factory Floor album was one of the best of 2013 .  It wasn’t .  It’s awful . 
17	How about a mass New Year’s resolution :  to exercise restraint before we spread stories that haven’t been confirmed ?  
17	An update to my earlier tweet about uninstalling the Facebook app :  Privacy ,  permission ,  and opting out 
17	 @ alastc Probably .  Looks like it was never properly tested on a tablet or laptop . 
17	 .  @ BTCare is it true that you will block potentially life - saving sex education websites ?  
17	Solid proof at CES that electronics companies don’t care about users  -  e . g .  the world’s most complicated TV remote .  
17	Or how about the dual - boot Android / Windows 8 tablet / laptop :  
17	Aw ,  you said  " sleeps "  instead of  " nights "  !  We all find you incredibly sweet and charming now ! 
17	 @ dstorey  @ thebabydino Sounds like you need to watch the last 20 minutes of Scrooged again . 
17	Merry Christmas .  
17	Id thought that 2013 wasnt a vintage year for documentaries ,  but The Act of Killing changed my mind completely .  
17	 @ brucel Thought you’d like it .  Staggering work .  Good interview with the director here :  
17	 @ djmc  @ DeanPerry The example given is SMS authorisation ,  which is fine .  But it’s an example ;  once permission’s given ,  they can do anything . 
17	In the past everyone celebrated New Year’s Eve but now they JUST LOOK AT THEIR PHONES .  
17	Was going to start asking questions about Harry Potter but worried that people will answer them as if they are actually important . 
17	False dichotomy or either - or dilemma :  who will be king in 2014 ?  
17	The only news from CES which is genuinely laudable is that all of Intel’s new processors are conflict mineral free .  
17	Without Alicia at the helm ,  I expect Blackberry will begin a slide into obsolescence . 
17	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers I don’t know .  But taking this to the European courts seems like a more time - intensive approach than uninstalling . 
17	Reliably informed by  @ richquick and  @ mkjones that  " We Are Never Ever… "  was released in 2012 .  Still the best song of 2013 . 
17	Very long ,  quite nerdy ,  but interesting piece on OS / 2 ,  and modern parallels with Microsoft and Blackberry :  
17	 @ luke161 Because as far as I can tell there are no actual jokes in it ,  just exaggerated pastiche . 
17	The vine - swinging with monkeys scene in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull is one of the lowest points of modern cinema history . 
17	The bugs I ate at  # dinosnores .   @  Natural History Museum 
17	This graffiti appears more admiring than insulting .  
17	Knowledge sharing is so common in the web industry that we forget how rare and newsworthy it is in some others .  
17	Oh great ,  the RAW profiles of more cameras I don’t own are ready for download . 
17	Hope to see fewer zombies and more pirates in games in 2014 . 
17	 @ RobHicks666 Kids should grow up too . 
17	How Britain exported next - gen surveillance :  
17	Taylor Swifts  " We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together "  was the best song of 2013 .  Im still immune to judgement . 
17	It’s unsurprising that a thing built purely for connection to the internet isn’t useful when the internet is unavailable . 
17	 @ arseblog That’d be brilliant ,  thanks .  I might blog some stuff about it ,  but won’t make any numbers public without permission . 
17	Charles Darwin getting into the Christmas spirit .   # dinosnores 
17	“These folks are brought to tears by the entirely normal holiday activities that they were just doing”  -  
17	 @ solemone Thanks !  Glad you liked it .  I lost my voice after that talk ,  you can hear it getting weirder as it goes on ! 
17	My first New Years resolution is to beat Level 32 of “Juicy Jacuzzi” in Candy Crush Saga . 
17	I bought a wireless charger for my phone .  Its about 3 %  more useful than a wired one ,  but feels 150 %  more futuristic . 
17	Looking forward to reading  @ andydavies’ and  @ anna _ debenham’s books this weekend .  
17	What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur with Tom Cruise and David Beckham ?  Tyranno - short - arse Becks .   # dinosnores
17	 @ paddycarey Considering 80 %  of what I do is through the browser ,  I have the same potential drawback on my Macbook ,  Ubuntu box ,  etc . 
17	 @ matthewhughes  @ verge It was mostly a rhetorical question .  The answer is depressingly simple . 
17	 @ webinista My fear is that it’s not Firefox OS that needs improving ,  but the web on mobile . 
17	This is my kind of table setting .   # dinosnores 
17	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers Those permissions are not optional .  I don’t agree to grant them .  My choice therefore is to uninstall the app . 
17	 @ TheIndyPeople  @ Independent That article is completely wrong .  Read his  * actual *  apology .  
17	Speaking of which ,  why do you still like Christmas ?  Nobody likes Christmas anymore . 
17	A little late ,  but just saw the documentary Blackfish ,  on the killer orca at SeaWorld .  Another outstanding  @ bbcstoryville film .  Recommended . 
17	Pretty bold of Samsung to position the Gear for the creepy stalker market .  
17	 @ brucel Thats old .  My shit is all original .  My jokes ,  too . 
17	 @ luke161 It’s knowing crap instead of accidental crap .  Fun for a two minute promo ,  but can you imagine actually watching 90 minutes of it ? 
17	If you’re at all interested in football ,  there’s a must - read article in  @ WiredUK on how data shapes modern tactics :  
17	 @ djmc  @ DeanPerry I didn’t . 
17	Love Charles Darwin’s notes on marrying :  
17	 @ brucel Put the kettle on and make some more . 
17	Firefox OS for TV ?  Wow .  I’m not even convinced it’s ready for mobile yet ,  let alone the murky waters of TV .  
17	 @ SuperStanners But without the debonair charm of Gareth Hunt . 
17	Being obliged to watch some Harry Potter .  Really ?  THIS is what all the fuss is about ? 
17	 @ richquick Old .  Im making new stuff  ( hence the quality )  . 
17	Two companies still owe me money from last year .  Reminders sent ,  public shaming to follow . 
17	 @ patrick _ h _ lauke Go easy on me . 
17	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers Not really .  If I give permission to use SMS in this way and FB later decide to use it in another way ,  they can . 
17	Florence Welch’s vocal on Sweet Nothing was probably the best of 2013 . 
17	 @ vasilis Hate to break it to you ,  those emails are fake . 
17	This morning I started singing “All the dingleberries” to Beyoncé’s ‘Single Ladies’ ,  and now I can’t stop . 
17	 @ brucel The only one I stopped watching was This Is The End .  Self - indulgent ,  too much improvisation . 
17	Amazing takedown of Love Actually :  
17	Ive said it before ,  but my personal data gets shared on my terms .  Its an exchange ,  a  negotiation ,  not a tax for installing an app . 
17	Two sets of navigation ,  two adverts ,  a promoted area ,  and an illustration .  But no useful content ,  not even a title . 
17	It looks like  @ recode have designed for huge high - res screens ;  on my Macbook I see no content on the page at all .  
17	 @ fabiovenni  @ arseblog I’ll be putting some analysis online ,  sure . 
17	 @ prehensile Not my screenshot ,  so don’t know the full URL . 
17	Blackberry should hurry to fill her role with someone more suitable .  I expect Christina Aguilera is available . 
17	 @ MaxTB It’s not kneejerk ;  I don’t want to give open access to my SMS to FB .  I choose to uninstall the app and use the website instead . 
17	 @ Glinner People Who Eat Darkness came to paperback in 2013 ,  not sure if that counts…
17	Arsenal win ,  so I can now stop screaming  " PLAY IT INTO THE FUCKING CORNER "  at the TV . 
17	Ana eating a cricket .   # dinosnores
