43	 @ jackmartinwelch yeeeey lol
43	 @ jackmartinwelch graphically and hardware wise the ps4 is better and its more for gaming ,  but so far the Xbox exclusive games look better
43	 @ john _ 1988 lol they both have good and bad things but ps4 has much better graphics card witch will make games look amazing ,  I cant decide ! 
43	Gonna have to get  # xboxone and  # ps4 lool
43	Xbox services seem better and the Kinect and smartglass seem cool ,  theres gotta be something good about it as its more expensive  # xboxone
43	I sort of prefer the Xbox one ,  I aint fussed about the restrictions with lending games or being online  # xboxonevsps4
43	 @ BelalMostafa there Is no official release date yet
