25	It continued :  In a sense ,  He wasn’t the first “son of God” .  And the crucial question is :  will He be any more successful than the first one ? 
25	This statement made me stop  & amp ;  think :  Jesus wasn’t the first sinless man to walk on earth as the great hope of humanity . 
25	 @ GraemeKennedy1  I wondered about that but couldnt c u !  I hear it never gets easier  & amp ;  watching Toy Story 3 can get u unexpectedly anytime !
