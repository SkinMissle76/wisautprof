15	At yesterdays gig I tried  " loud obnoxious super wide vibrato soloist "  to be interesting .  It never actually sounds as extreme outside my head
15	Ive think Ive been pretty versatile  changing my sound on violin these last few weeks . 
15	The stars look awesome tonight !  !  ! 
15	Going to have lunch at Chuys with some friends !  !  ! 
15	I feel like I make so much progress when I am flexible and open to change .  Not just violin .   :  )  Ive had a great last few weeks . 
15	Going on an adventure  : D
15	Im so glad I have my violin back !  Most of the melted varnish buffed out  +  open seam glued up .  I feel like I sound awesome  : D practice time

15	I just ate a whole thing of celery . 
15	So I just discovered that the skin under my jaw where my violin - hickey exists is oddly very stretchy .  .  .  Yup .  This is disgusting
15	So I completely failed at exiting a room and headbutted the corner of a really heavy door leaving a large red swollen bump on my forehead
15	Why cant intonation be something that needs to be perfected once ?  Then I could spend the rest of my time to work on other things  : p
15	Eating carrots  & amp ;  cream cheese .  I am really glad that it is Friday . 
15	Finished with todays classes ,  2 hours practiced ,  and finished my laundry .  Im going to the library for homework since the weather is nice . 
15	Theres nothing like mistakenly refreshing a page with a whole essay typed out to motivate me to type it again .  .  . 
15	I have a box of dryer sheets near me while Im finishing my English paper and it smells awesome . 
15	Some of my favorite songs and classical works on my iTunes have accumulated several thousands of plays over the years .

15	Yay !  now I cant play c natural AND b .  Thanks ,  violin .  You get to stay in your case until you behave like every other violin in existence
15	I hate my violin and I have barely practiced all week .  .  . 
15	I glued up a seam in one of my violins in the dorms kitchen .  .  .  Its so awkward when theres nobody to talk to .

15	Today was strange ,  I read slaughterhouse - 5 start to finish in about 2 . 5 hours thanks to spreeder .  .  .  Have I ever read a whole book in a day ? 
15	I gotta say my violin absolutely hates Obligato strings .  Back to Dominants .  .  .   : p
15	I somehow managed to momentarily fall asleep on my bike and ran into one of those things you lock bikes on .  Im laughing my face off . 
15	I just got through 5 hours of classwork / studying in the library .  That was a depressing bike ride back too ;  Im soaked . 
15	Breaking bowhairs when I least expect it while practicing makes me incredibly happy  : D
15	a little girl walked up to me after the concert and asked for my autograph ,  she said I was her favorite musician  :  ) 
15	Ive been practicing sound post adjustments and I sort of understand how it works now .  my violin sounds pretty beastly now
15	Why is nutella so freakin good ?  I probably ate too much of it just now
15	Listening to Shostakovichs first piano trio and its really good .  .  . 
15	I enjoyed the extended weekend ,  although my schedule seems like a mess this week .  .  .  less internet ,  more violin sounds like a good start
