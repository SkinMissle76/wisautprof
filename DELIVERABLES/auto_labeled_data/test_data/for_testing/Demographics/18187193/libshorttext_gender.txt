-1	Serious Collision on the A43 ,  road closed both ways between north bound BP garage at  # Brackley and southbound B4525 at  # Syresham
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil  @ ConnorHarte44 Did they put Ronaldo LW ?  Cole would cover his lack of defensive shift so well with pace  & amp ;  stamina
-1	 @ Minarzouki Any predictions for tonight ,  Mina ? 
-1	 @ FFTPerformance  @ Ashthegash
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil the style guru as hes also known .  Im freelancing and other office work but I definitely want to contribute !

-1	 @ Minarzouki tough isnt it .  Such a great tempo so far .  Think Destro might have a say ,  should he be introduced . 
-1	 @ Podolski10 Looking forward to your return Poldi ! 
-1	Wigan came to us with more invention and flair than Mourinhos Chelsea just did .  But we still stuttered ,  and looked like we lacked ideas
-1	Just switched on Roma vs Fiorentina .  What a strike from Vargas ! 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil haha ,  almost like sleeping pattern at Uni !  You at CNN now ? 
-1	I dont watch much of Serie A ,  but that game was a fantastic advert for the league .   # Roma  # Fiorentina
-1	Just had an email from someone saying they wanted to transfer  $ 10 . 5 million to my bank account .  .  all they need is my trust and co operation ! 
-1	Man U into the Quarters then .  .  . 
-1	 @ bala _ chn is that an official FB account ?  ! 
-1	Just realised Michael Owen is commentating on  # Swansea vs Newcastle .  .  No wonder I feel tired  # boring
-1	 @ Sport _ AdRev Is this you when you lose on FM ?  
-1	Higuain currently 28 / 1 to score a hat trick tonight  # NAPvAFC
-1	Tevez and Vidals understanding is so good that they even have similar hair and facial hair styles  # JuveRoma

-1	Well ,  Sneijder just provided that moment  # Galatasaray  # Juve
-1	 @ hump _ K  @ Artekkers should shake it up vs West Ham .  Poldi on the left Özil in the middle
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil perfect !  Ill get on it as soon as ! 
-1	Am a massive fan of Karim Benzema
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil  @ ConnorHarte44 think the amazing thing is ,  though all wingers ,  all had one stand out feature that makes hard to choose
-1	Can tell the January Transfer Window is just around the corner .  .  .  Twitters ITKs starting to try and tweet rumours with authority
-1	 @ LeighMonty12 Well ,  I hope so !  Bet hes offered Valencia job ! 
-1	 @ Shteeeeeve dont know what I feel about it .  Professional job needed tonight .  Expect 3 changes
-1	 @ LeighMonty12  @ ChrisMorrow44 When have I ever said that ?  ! 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil dont know how you manage to stay up !  Read your guide but still !  Guessing no early start tomorrow ? 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil  @ LTPeterson92 hes a no 10 surely ? 
-1	 @ StewartTobias  @ LeighMonty12  Stew ,  is Leigh your source ?  ! 
-1	 @ Ashthegash  @ FFTPerformance I didnt say that did I ! 
-1	 @ bala _ chn where did that come from ?   ( Dont necessarily disagree to be honest ) 
-1	Great header Bendtner ! 
-1	Then there really will be Juve uproar ! 
-1	Just watched Flaminis goal ,  get in there son !  Love his passion .   # SleeveItYeah
-1	Got a cheeky feeling Gala will nick this ! 
-1	What a pass from Ramsey ! 
-1	 @ LTPeterson92 strange isnt it ! 
-1	I know the knockout stages await for the victor ,  but dont really see why Juve are complaining so much - play on pitches like this most weeks ! 
-1	 @ LeighMonty12  @ StewartTobias if only ! 
-1	 @ LeighMonty12  @ StewartTobias and why would they let that slip ? 
-1	And Pirlo is back for Juve !  Looking forward to watching Pjanic for Roma . 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil I really rate Coentrao ,  would be a good addition for you .  But the key has to be a CM ! 
-1	“Sport has the power to change the world…it has the power to inspire .  It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does .  .  . 
-1	And the gulf in class as well as quality ever more apparent this evening as we react to Walcotts injury .   # GetWellSoonTheo  # AFC  # THFC  # Spuds
-1	 @ 1Walid1  @ SimonGoodkind Patos not  ;  ) 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil I meant positional wise ,  not quality wise  ;  )  just needs confidence ? 
-1	 @ northbanklower the second yellow was so soft .  Crowd practically gave it . 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil Not being funny ,  but cant imagine how youd fare against the likes of Bayern ,  especially without Carrick .  January buys ? 
-1	Back to Arsenal ,  so chuffed for this man .  .  .  Even with continued criticism works so hard for the team .   # Giroud 
-1	 @ charlie1811 But still had time to tweet ! 
-1	“ @ OllieHolt22 :   @ LeighMonty12  @ Cosgrove90  @ ChrisMorrow44 anyone recognise the chap on the right ?  !  
-1	 @ WengerBoy1  @ CulannDavies Not including Poldi ?

-1	 @ goonernick cheers buddy ! 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil Id struggle to stay awake at work even if I did that ! 
-1	This is brilliant from  @ LittleDutchVA 
-1	 @ Rupert _ Fryer Bayern on English TV ? 
-1	 @ Sport _ AdRev  @ uefacorruption alright clever cloggs !  Enjoying your holiday ? 
-1	And how good was Gnabry !  Looked strong and confident with the ball -  is so quick too .  Really exciting prospect . 
-1	Jenko could teach Sagna how to cross ! 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil Think it will a busy Jan ,  you wanting CMs ,  us potentially after a ST and Suarez to Madrid (  ?  )  .  .  . 
-1	Terry and Cahill joint MOTM ?  Eesh
-1	 @ Ashthegash  @ FFTPerformance No idea how that had enough on it to roll in .  But no ,  its a reference to shoot on sight ! 
-1	 @ ConnorHarte44  @ BrownBearSahil where your allegiance lies has a big say . 
-1	 @ Jon _ LeGossip Linked with him every window ! 
-1	 @ LeighMonty12 Yeah ,  its ridiculous .  Reminds me of me on FM ,  can never land one I want ! 
-1	With Theos injury ,  makes me think that had this been this time last year ,  David Villa would surely have been a Gooner  # Arsenal
-1	 @ Sport _ AdRev 
-1	 @ beabrown94 Nice one !  Hope Uni is going well  :  ) 
-1	 @ CakeLH thats a weekly occurrence ! 
-1	 @ G92Jones Just realised that youve got Oxford in the FA Cup ,  tough one bud ! 
-1	 @ BGJasonP Congratulations buddy ! 
-1	Brilliant play from Drogba .  Hes still incredible
-1	Not vintage from Real tonight ,  but great dummy from Benzema for Ronaldo to tap home .  Quiet night for Ronnie ,  but surely Ballon dOr winner ? 
-1	 @ LTPeterson92  @ BrownBearSahil missed out there .  I think Herrera would have been for you ,  but need a physical presence and creator in one
-1	 @ Sport _ AdRev Good man !  Works good ,  just a distinct lack of Football and FM chat ! 
-1	 "  .  .  . as Arsenals season plunged into chaos .  "   -  The Sun .  What a load of tosh that sentence is . 
-1	 @ arse2mouse  @ Flannyballs What is Costa said to be on p / w at Atletico ? 
-1	Usually quite rate Howard Webb but should have been a pen for Liverpool then
-1	 @ LeighMonty12  @ LTPeterson92 Id genuinely take a punt on Berbatov if we are after a ST
-1	Jonjo Shelvey is a barrel of laughs isnt he
-1	 @ MessiMinutes if you want to be the best ,  you have to beat the best .  Were capable . 
-1	It speaks to youth in a language they understand .  Sport can create hope where once there was only despair .  .  . 
-1	 @ LTPeterson92 thought he had taken a touch too many but managed to squeeze the ball through .  Loved it .  Hate Dawson
-1	 @ LeighMonty12 I reckon my signed photo of him will be worth a small fortune after that  ;  ) 
-1	 @ garns007 decent draw then bud ! 
-1	 @ Hesfivefootfour  @ LittleDutchVA not saying the Ox will score those goals ,  but is a real handful and more confident running with ball
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil I wouldnt fancy Gala .  Away leg will be so tough . 
-1	Superb work from Bale ,  is he fully fit though ?  Left thigh taped up and obvs missed PSG friendly . 
-1	Just been watching Jose Antonio Reyes videos .  Easy to forget what a gifted player he is / was .  Such a great left foot . 
-1	What a game yesterday .  So chuffed for Tomas and what a finish from Santi ! 
-1	 @ Jgibbins  " Oh no you didnt !  " 
-1	Nice lunchtime spent listening to Frank Sinatra in a little café in Buckingham
-1	And Wigan were staring relegation in the mouth
-1	 @  _ Wrighty7 and as Vieira said on last weeks documentary ,  he was in line to be next captain . 
-1	 @ davidjaca Salvo did say he wouldnt be sacked during season ,  so if not being pushed ,  why jump ? 
-1	RIP Nelson Mandela
-1	 @ garns007 thought that would be the case ,  probably same for me .  Was a good game last season in the League Cup ! 
-1	 @ ConnorHarte44  @ BrownBearSahil in our 49 game unbeaten run Pires scored 19 goals .  .  .  He was class . 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil need a consistent base too ,  constantly changing CBs and CMs  ( I know cant be helped )  but regularity will help
-1	 @ annalouiseadams For what its worth I think you should go to the Uni that you enjoyed most .  Could you not loan your ST out ? 
-1	Millions of Euros worth of talent subbed on and off for Real and their home - grown Jesé sets Benzema up .   # realmadrid
-1	 @ davidjaca A la Rami .  Shame theyve farmed him out on loan from Jan ,  esp if Dukic isnt even in charge then ! 
-1	 @ MirrorFootball Nothing like Wenger ,  the coat isnt long enough ! 
-1	 @ bambambriggo haha well I dont know if its meant to be raining heavily ! 
-1	 .  .  . It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers . ” # inspirational  # NelsonMandela
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil that was on a plate though son ! 
-1	Any Gooners looking for North Bank Lower tickets for Chelsea go on website now ,  2 sat together available for £62
-1	Looking forward to Juventus vs Roma
-1	 @ piersmorgan I cant see it Piers -  never ,  ever going to hand over £80million for him .  no matter how good he is . 
-1	 @ bambambriggo dunno ,  Im not the blinking weatherman ! 
-1	 @ beabrown94 Still working in Jaffe and Neal ? 
-1	 @ JamieCutteridge  @ thehuwdavies  @ themichaelowen he could say anything but hed still be boring
-1	 @ bala _ chn all my other tweets are about Theo and signings and then you pop up with that .  I love him too ,  absolute class . 
-1	Happy Birthday to my Uncle and diehard Gooner ,   @ BigGoonerGadge1  ! 
-1	 @ garns007 should be a good game .  You going to try and go ? 
-1	 @ arsenalvision Surely Wenger wouldnt allow that ? 
-1	Lazio vs Inter and Real Madrid vs Celta Vigo tonight .  Sorted ! 
-1	
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil why would you do that ?  Haha . 
-1	 @ LTPeterson92  @ BrownBearSahil thats what I mean ,  Coentrao good at both aspects .  Could definitely solve your long term LB problem
-1	Come on then lads ,  lets send out a big message ahead of the weekend .   # AFC
-1	Is Danny Rose a Gooner ? 
-1	Odds on Higuain to score a hat - trick tonight ?   # AFC  # Napoli
-1	Brilliant draw for Swansea ! 
-1	RIP Eusébio
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil  @ ConnorHarte44 I hate Cole since he left for Chelski ,  but dont remember much of Irwin and Cole was awesome
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil haha great shout ,  he was good at that .  Good work mate ,  so pleased First Instinct is doing well too
-1	Bit late ,  but Happy New Year everyone ! 
-1	 @ SianyMacalarny Brilliant stuff ,  Sian .  Completely agree RE Vermaelen too .  For years we have wished for 3 / 4 quality CBs and now we have 3 ! 
-1	Awesome defending from Castan ,  this match is brilliant !  Rossi should have taken it on his right side ,  wanted too much time
-1	 @ LeighMonty12 Well ,  now Ive put £5 on Zola to WBA ,  he probably will take over the Spuds .  .  . 
-1	 @ Sport _ AdRev 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil two obvious names massive losses .  An in form Nani could be massive boost
-1	 @ G92Jones would be good mate but I play on a Saturday !  Would be different if it was to report ,  though ! 
-1	 @ bambambriggo yes mate away at Chippy
-1	 @ JakeButlerr See above bud ! 
-1	How does this work ?  
-1	 @ charlie1811 Oh ,  I was really impressed for a minute !   ;  ) 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil yeah .  More like Özil ?  ! 
-1	 @ BrownBearSahil true .  But I dont think its all doom and gloom ,  youre 5 points off -  thats nothing .  Such a long way to go . 
-1	What were Luiz Alberto and Lucas doing there ?  !  Didnt pick up the runners and gift Hull a third
-1	 @ bambambriggo Ill text it to you bud
-1	Bayern then .  Bring it on !   # AFC
-1	Park Ju Young to be the hero today ! 
-1	I really dont know how Madridistas ever doubted Benzema ,  hes class . 
-1	 @ Ashthegash  @ FFTPerformance Basically ,  just make a decision quickly !
