-0.48	 @ themanofdann I remember last time we went skating  : P
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim f *  * k Meepo ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AlexTrott _  only uses 2 . 5W vs 200W of the 6950 I have made about  $ 1 . 7 in a week !  The price for them has gone up to £60 though lol
-0.48	 @ OX _ Matt your PC cools the room ?  My fans just pump out roasting hot air ! 
-0.48	 @ GaryRae ooooo how is it ?  A Firefox OS excites me ! 
-0.48	 @ BDogCarter not fixed yet ?  ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AndyNico _  sends pictures  +  text and videos in a unique way .  Not that I think its worth anything at all but based on other tech .  . 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _   @ Techpaste he might be able to break even in around a year but difficulty is ramping up faster and faster ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _   @ Techpaste my Boss grabbed one of those off ebay for £300 before the prices went nuts !  Generates about  $ 3 a day .  .  . 
-0.48	AMDs new FX - 9590 is a little bit crazy !  Interesting to see what they can manage if power / heat dont bother you lol
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AndyNico _   .  . purchases I dont think that matters  : P
-0.48	 @ DeanJPepper  @ lukewhitt _  not sure what else my phone needs !  Other than the usual faster / better battery type improvements ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  really ?  I thought they were treating it like any other SP or are they trying even harder to go all Apple on us  : P
-0.48	 @ virginmedia you seem to miss my point !  It isnt unlimited and you shouldnt claim it is !  Doesnt matter if it affects one or a million ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AlexTrott _  eBay last week !  I only got one but I wish a had gone for a 10 pack at £200 ! 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _  Just got my Netflix trial on  : P Though its Dota time now ! 
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim  @ lukewhitt _   @ dave _ lambert77 thats pretty much the only Tennis I have seen this year ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ OX _ Matt SSDs are a must !  The H60 could be replaced with a big air cooler for a good saving .  My H80i wasnt worth the money ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste you could try mining Litecoins instead as thats still only done on GPUs  ( for now anyway )  but of course its much riskier ! 
-0.48	 @ DeanJPepper  @ lukewhitt _   @ craig _ pilgrim  @ BigSpud nope ! 
-0.48	Too many Apple and Microsoft tweets !  !  Someone let me know when something actually interesting happens ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AndyNico _  Only if you want to keep getting a better experience !  If you leave it for 5 years it will still be faster than console
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AndyNico _  its a high risk high reward choice !  There was a time when people though Twitter / Facebook were worthless ! 
-0.48	 @ AndyNico _  because like a lot of Apple gear its comically expensive for what you get  : P
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim not a bad looking card or price !  You in need of more grunt now ?  If not wait till BF4 and AMDs new cards before any upgrades ! 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _  Time to leave Twitter for a few days ! 
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim bold but wrong !  Should learn to multi task !  I train and play Dota at the same time !   # Dota2IsASport  # comeback  # winning
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _  I mean how was your trip ? 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _   @ craig _ pilgrim  @ BigSpud  @ DeanJPepper cant escape !  Perhaps if you got the certification it would go away ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _   @ Techpaste the price of the hardware is rising faster than the Bitcoin price !  Soooo many people want in on the Bitcoin action
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim  @ Techpaste  @ AlexTrott _  I am in Florida !  Starting suffer from Dota withdrawal ! 
-0.48	 @ themanofdann thats a pretty wild idea !  Have to pick a date and grab Martin and Rob ! 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _   @ AlexTrott _   @ craig _ pilgrim our net died too !   : P Good times ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ AlexTrott _  If you want to punt the money go dedicated ASIC hardware .  My USB Block Errupter  ( £20 )  mines as fast as a 6950
-0.48	 @ BDogCarter can you not get a cheap used mobo / ram for your current CPU on eBay ?  Bargain central ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  you can have a local account for the machine or store your password for automatic login . 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _  welcome back !  Time to get in on this Dota action ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  I know the feeling !  Its not pleasant ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  the new hardware is pretty slow so I am not surprised that they need to keep it at 720p ! 
-0.48	 @ AndyNico _  I am sure somewhere in that utility belt he has some Kryptonite ! 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _  this was not helpful ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _   @ virginmedia yeah it is an absolute piss take !  Do they still get away with calling it unlimited ? 
-0.48	 @ GaryRae  @ dmgestate yeah its a joke what they get away with charging !  We found one that charged £75 a person which was much better ! 
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _   @ craig _ pilgrim  @ dave _ lambert77 this is the best Tennis related photo ever ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  guess it just doesnt scale down well !  Sucks for the console gamers  : P
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  Competition in the GCard market always makes me happy  : D
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim except those ones of course ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste its not an addiction !  I could quit any time .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  I just dont want to !  We should indeed play  : D
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ craig _ pilgrim I dont know how people exist with just one !  I would like to replace my 24 "  with another 27 "  as well  : P
-0.48	 @ lukewhitt _   @ craig _ pilgrim  @ dave _ lambert77 its the ghost .  .  .  .  . 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _   @ virginmedia yeah so 6mins of 120mb then unlimited at 30 ? 
-0.48	 @ AndyNico _   @ the _ gadgeteur  @ The _ liv80 because its £200 - £300 cheaper than most flagship phones .  .  .  .  . 
-0.48	 @ codinghorror been rocking 16GB for 2 years .  .  .  Maybe I can finally put it to good use ! 
-0.48	I just donated to  # Wikipedia while reading about Grace Hopper .  Help keep it free !    # keepitfree 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  lol its a brave new world ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  Not really that odd .  You can freely upgrade to Windows 8 . 1 but not to a Xbox One  : P
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim  # pilgrimfail
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim I am still very happy with mine !   
-0.48	 @ phytoplanktonic 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste  @ craig _ pilgrim 3 would be nice !  If I had a bigger desk at home I would be rocking 3 there already ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste Crazy idea !  I think competitive Dota is still out of my league !  TY for the invite though .  Let me know how you get on ! 
-0.48	 @ Techpaste its a little late in the day to start mining Bitcoins on GPUs .  Even AMD cards are eclipsed by the dedicated hardware now ! 
-0.48	 @ AlexTrott _  My machines are password protected for remote access so I havent noticed a difference !  That said I never use the store ! 
-0.48	 @ virginmedia I just object to you labelling a product as unlimited then setting out some limits under the title  " traffic management "   # fail
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim and this !  
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim thats the stuff !  Put it on a laptop and you can play even more while on holiday !   ;  ) 
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim I am not going to say a word ! 
-0.48	 @ BDogCarter Disc ?  Post ?  Thats old school  : P
-0.48	 @ craig _ pilgrim even if you dont want an AMD card they will at least spice up prices a little bit I expect ! 
-0.48	 @ AndyNico _  yes you are  : P
-0.48	 @ Techpaste yeah we live in a HD world 1080p rips all the way !
