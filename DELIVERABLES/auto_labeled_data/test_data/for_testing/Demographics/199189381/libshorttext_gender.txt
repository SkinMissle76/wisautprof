-1	 # walsallcreative lack of modern suites ,  space and a digital initiative to support the industries and encourage young talent . 
-1	Not too sure about omitting the en0 port on new MacBook Pros .  Wireless isnt a replacement for 1Gbps ethernet .  Got an 1800 - 24G for a reason !

-1	Using so many different services on my domains .  Amazons AWS for IaaS ,   @ CloudFlare for DNS and App Firewall ,   @ Barracuda for Email . 
-1	One of the more interesting things about these Versatility CCUs is that they can take bog standard PSTN phones without a problem . 
-1	 @ TylrAndy Nooo ,  howd you manage that ?  Could always ask Autoglass .  They do windscreens for free .   ;  ) 
-1	Versatility has a slightly different dialtone .  It is the standard PSTN dialtone but slightly lower pitch .  Dont think itll be a problem . 
-1	Looks like something Id have to watch out for if ever deploying apps with stubs not called  " setup . exe "  :

-1	Whats this Class Action waiver in Valves Steam Subscriber agreement ?  Is this standard practice now ? 
-1	If youve used Hansoft ,  what do you think of it ?  Elements of it are reminding me of RMS .  Is it support ticketing also ? 
-1	 @ TylrAndy youre right though ,  suing Apple will only expose RIM to further unwanted litigation .  Gotta love software patents !   * sigh *
