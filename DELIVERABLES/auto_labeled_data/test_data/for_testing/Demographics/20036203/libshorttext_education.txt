2	Great performance by Bobs Worth !  Unioniste was disappointing ! 
2	 @ bobblybibbly amazing !  !  Was screaming

2	Bloody magnificent  @ Tidal _ Bay u needed another furlong !  !  !  Got Mountainous too so Im very chuffed !  !   # WelshNational

2	Cmon  @ Tidal _ Bay do it for me lad !  !  !   # WelshNational
2	 @ bobblybibbly excited !  !  ! 
2	 @ bobblybibbly yeah I love Hey Big Spender .  Watched him win a few times .  U cud pick 6 that could win !  !  Ive a couple EW too
2	 @ bobblybibbly I generally back him but hes a lot of weight but a legend of a horse
2	 @ stevielovesgaga Im loving it
2	 @ bobblybibbly I got him at 14 - 1 weeeee
2	 @ bobblybibbly in a lesser race hed carry 7 lb less than today -  I wouldnt fancy him tbh
2	 @ bobblybibbly think so -  its to do with the min weight carried in the race and is carrying more weight ie 7 lb than his true weight . 
2	 @ bobblybibbly I think its basically hes carrying 7lb more than he would have done due to his official ratings compared to other horses
2	Im not backing any favourites today .  Just stuck a pin in the welsh national but always back  @ Tidal _ Bay and gone with Unioniste in Lexus
2	 @ MrMoves poor lad .  Hopefully they can sort it -  Denman had a similar thing I think
2	 @ MrMoves irregular heartbeat apparently
2	 @ MrMoves  @ Racing _ UK I backed Sire De Grugy as no value in SS !  Glad I did now !  !  !
