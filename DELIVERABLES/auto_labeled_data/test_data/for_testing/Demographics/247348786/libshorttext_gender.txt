1	 @ AnomalousLondon  @ RachelCDailey  ‚Ä¶ . are better platforms that allow for you to set up with your website  # bloghour
1	 @ Annie _ Squirrel  @ suzym _ marie  @ UKBlogAwards I might try mailchimp but not too sure people would read a newsletter  # bloghour

1	 @ joanna _ isms I‚Äôm on blogger as well ,  I got my domain name about a  year ago via blogger  -  I went to settings  -  basic  & amp ;  down to publishing .  .  . 
1	 @ outmumbered  @ UKBlogAwards Thats the same for me Emma  :  ) 
1	Why when I have an assignment due in tomorrow can I not find the motivation to write a small 300 words  & amp ;  be done ?
