3	Stupid fire alarm ,  take 2
3	Very promising and strong first half for England certainly set out our stool ,  England 12 NZ 0
3	finally finishing our last assignment of the term !   # lookingforwardtohome
3	Prams are lethal in a crowd !  Walking along then BAM !  Head over heals and looking like a right prick .  Fireworks were amazing though !  !

3	My willingness to get up for the 9am economics lecture is really quite low  # unmotivated  # knowitalready

3	 @ TomMedd I dont think we can be called arrogant winners after beating NZ can we ?

3	What is happening to Hazell ?  ?  he never starts fights yet he is seeing red !  !  he must have been provoked but no the ref never sees that
3	Good end to a cagey first half for England ,  leading 14 - 11 against Australia
3	NZ have imploded !  25 - 14
3	 @ TomMedd alright then ,  ill bet theyll blame the ref tho !

3	I am wearing a gloucester top I do not want to know about a harlequins or saracens season ticket
3	Such a good a day yesterday ,  all 3 rugby teams winning in varsity !  And a fantastic night followed
3	Stuck in the SU doing coursework ,  the choice of music over the speaker phones isnt the best  :  ( 
3	Really not sure the new scrum laws make the scrum any quicker ,  or painless to watch ,  still its  # earlydays
3	Im looking .  Forward to tonight ,  itll complete a great day ,  with gloucester winning earlier ! 
3	Been picked to rugby play for Plymouth Uni 1st team against UWE tomorrow ,  BRING IT ON
3	Seems like  @ Caroline _ 956 and her friends are taking a trip down memory lane with some 90s music .  .  .  ear plugs are needed

3	Its finally white in Plymouth !  Shame its been caused by 30 seconds of extremely heavy hail ,  not snow  :  / 
3	I meant better people ,   love them morethan anything in the world  # unilife  # espeshstace
3	 @ GRHathaway ahaha dont kid yourself ,  it was one meal and Stace did most of it ! 
3	 @ harrietbarter its horrible !  !  Some how it has something to do with Englands history ,  but Id rather stick with the red and white shirt
3	England are walking them in now !  32 - 14 it could really happen !  ! 
3	 @ Caroline _ 956 nope ,  just a lot of rain  :  ( 
3	After the British cycling coach is injured in a crash on the same day as Wiggins ,  police are looking for an American wearing a yellow jersey
3	Its so good to be back home !  Had a funny night with  @ Caroline _ 956 and the family ,  dog included !  Got harlem shake stuck in my head though
3	Just cleaned up after a training session in a mud bath !  Had a great time and wish it was as good at Plymouth  # sadlynot  # goodstartto2013
3	Waldrom gets picked over Morgan for the England v Fiji game ,  yet in the Gloucester  -  Leicester match Waldrom was out classed by Morgan ! 
3	Four games of the RWC 2015 are to be played at Kingsholm ,  one of only two stadiums used at club level ,  the other being Exeters Sandy Park

3	Yesss Gloucester ,  what a game ,  beating Quins 17 - 15 ,  definatly worth braving the cold for !   # thriller  # gloucesterrugby
3	The head of the Welsh Rugby Union is living in a dream land at the moment ,  which is a bit odd .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
3	Just me Dan Lydicates parents and now off to the Gold Coast ,  but really looking forward to seeing the 1st Test tomorrow !   # excitingtimes
3	Scrums are going to be a mess today with George clancy as ref ,  still come on England !  !  !

3	Probably the most productive days since being back at uni ,  with a hangover ,  I am hanging now !  !   # gettingmyheaddown
3	My flat mates are amazing I couldnt have asked for people to live with xxx
3	What a half for Gloucester !  Sarries are not on form ,  glos got a red card in the first min but are fighting hard to make it 12 - 10 to glos
3	Really not looking forward to the 21 hour flight but at least were leaving the Aussies with some  # britishweather 
3	500 words in 3 hours ,  only 1000 left ,  but Im struggling for ideas ! 
3	Stupid fire alarm

3	Just got my Accounting test back ,  got a first !   : D a - level maths is a thing of the past now  # blipontheradar
3	YESSS !  !  Well done Samoa at beating Wales 19 - 26 ! 
3	Really liked watching The Unforgetable Spike Milligan on itv  # comedyatitsbest
3	Unbelievable that the SU wont show the Gloucester game ,  but enough screens for the very few numbers of people watching WH v MC
3	Its good to be back in bed after the earlier alarm  # sleepyhead
3	Good to see durley rfc on the big stage at twickenham !  ! 
3	Should have brought Freddie Burns on to give England more go forward ,  Flood hampers any chance of scoring tries  # bbcsixnations
3	On the way to twickenham and its snowing in reading ! 
3	This has turned into a pathetic night tbh
3	Taken 2 better be good !  Were having to wait 45mins because the earlier showing sold out
3	The new engagement rules at scrum time blatantly benefit the southern hemisphere teams
3	 @ Caroline _ 956 the dog obviously ate it ,  or next doors cat ,  either way ,  the dog need more attention than those things  # dogsarethebest
3	On my way back from seeing the lions beat Australia 21 - 23 !  Such a gokd atmosphere ,  pitty Aussies complain too much ,  should learn to kick .  .  . 
3	this seems a legit excuse : 
3	My sister has passed her driving test before I have even had a lesson  :  ( 
3	Could have made more of tonight  # winsomeyoulosesome  # learnfrommistakes
3	 @ MrChrisRackley i have no idea what youre on about

3	Having a good afternoon with my family ,  even if it is for an open day  :  ) 
3	Garcia what a shot !  !   # rydercup
3	Some people these days
3	To the guy sat behind me , Just because Gloucester lost doesnt mean theyve  " become utter rubbish recently "  did you watch the quins game ?
