9	Thats it for economics this term ,  lecturer is on holiday next week  # godsend  # liein
9	 @ TomMedd he was alright ,  terrible at the mauls and some of the breakdowns ,  but thats Clancy for you
9	You cannot categorize everybody in the worlds personality into 16 different categories and say they stay that way for life !  People change . 
9	So happy to be at kingsholm again to watch Gloucester ! 
9	Stowford press in London ,  wow thats a first
9	The Vodka Jelly Babies have kept a 100 %  record this Xmas ,   explaining the name produced some laughs  @ Caroline _ 956  # pubquiz

9	Good atmosphere here at kingsholm for Gloucester v Scarlets ,  14 - 0 30mins gone

9	Skyfall has become the most successful film in the UK box office ,  beating Avatar ,  wow thats impressive !   # no1  # bestfilm

9	Just seen a Ferrari and Lamborghini on a car transporter but theyre sharing it with a battered Ford KA  +   other cheap cars ,  odd combination
9	Stupid fire alarm ,  take 2
9	Very promising and strong first half for England certainly set out our stool ,  England 12 NZ 0
9	finally finishing our last assignment of the term !   # lookingforwardtohome
9	Prams are lethal in a crowd !  Walking along then BAM !  Head over heals and looking like a right prick .  Fireworks were amazing though !  ! 
9	Some people cannot take a joke ,  just man up ,  especially when Im making a joke to break the ice and I dont actually offend you  # pathetic

9	My willingness to get up for the 9am economics lecture is really quite low  # unmotivated  # knowitalready
9	Economics module at uni  =  another year of a level economics  # boring
9	Closest thing  Plymouth gets to snow is a ridiculous down pour ,  typical  # britishweather

9	economics essay ,  handed in ,  now time to catch up on some sleep ! 
9	statistics  =  gcse maths
9	Vettel has enough quality to see out the race and take the title tomorrow ,  Alonso is going to need a lot of luck or a freak accident to win

9	Get Ashton off ,  hes having a mare ,  shouldnt have started in the first place  # ENGvAUS
9	There is only one reasonable explanation to why Im up at this time in the morning ,   # rugby
9	 @ TomMedd I dont think we can be called arrogant winners after beating NZ can we ? 
9	some how ,  a business law book is more interesting than that of an accounting book ! 
9	 @ harrietbarter At least we arent Wales or Scotland though .  .  .  .  .  . 
9	Too early for a fire alarm
9	 @ MathewTrevor you finally open your eyes then  ;  )

9	Come on England !  Lets show the Scots how to really play rugby  # 6nations
9	Solid first half for england ,  just need to score more points to win the game .  .  .  .  England 6 South Africa 9
9	What is happening to Hazell ?  ?  he never starts fights yet he is seeing red !  !  he must have been provoked but no the ref never sees that
9	Good end to a cagey first half for England ,  leading 14 - 11 against Australia
9	NZ have imploded !  25 - 14
9	 @ TomMedd alright then ,  ill bet theyll blame the ref tho ! 
9	First washing trip at uni went well ,  ended up putting dirty clothing in a tumble dryer .  .  .  .  .  .   # rookiemistake

9	Ive got too much energy considering how little sleep I had last night and the coursework Ive been doing all day  # whatishappening
9	Forgotten whats its like to watch Gloucester at kingsholm !  Such a good atmosphere ,  come on glos !   # beentoolong  # greatbirthdaypresent
9	Never knew the Friday evening train from Plymouth to Bristol has such a rep that police have to walk up and down the train
9	Im really not up for this lecture ,  rather be watching last night Russell Howards good news !  ! 
9	What a great day ,  Wales losing to the Aussies in the last minute but more importantly England smashing New Zealand
9	Microphone by example sums me up
9	Looking forward to playing for Plymouth Uni 1sts again ! 
9	 @ harrietbarter the white kit didnt make us win ,  had more possesion tho
9	Watching the lions tour preview on sky sports has made me so excited about going to Australia soon !   # britishandirishlionstour  # excited
9	 @ harrietbarter maybe but the second half they didnt threaten the aussies too much  :  /  still looking forward to the NZ game at the SU ! 
9	Great news to wake up to ,  Obama is president for another term !  Romney idea of having no windows in planes obviously didnt help .  .  .   # Obama

9	So happy to be going home a day early !  Really excited to see all the family together again ! 
9	A tight game at Kingsholm but Gloucester grind out a win in wet conditions ,  Gloucester 18 Exeter 16
9	I am wearing a gloucester top I do not want to know about a harlequins or saracens season ticket
9	Such a good a day yesterday ,  all 3 rugby teams winning in varsity !  And a fantastic night followed
9	Stuck in the SU doing coursework ,  the choice of music over the speaker phones isnt the best  :  ( 
9	Really not sure the new scrum laws make the scrum any quicker ,  or painless to watch ,  still its  # earlydays
9	Im looking .  Forward to tonight ,  itll complete a great day ,  with gloucester winning earlier ! 
9	Been picked to rugby play for Plymouth Uni 1st team against UWE tomorrow ,  BRING IT ON
9	Seems like  @ Caroline _ 956 and her friends are taking a trip down memory lane with some 90s music .  .  .  ear plugs are needed
9	So I spent pretty much all my economics lecture drawing this ,  quite  # productive I though 
9	Not a bad costume !   # fancydress 
9	Free cider in new look !   # heaven
9	Also dont make up stuff which makes the rest of your flat dislike me ,  I would never ever push a girl so stop spouting shit  # getalife
9	 @ JasminnieH  @ StaceOrd  @ jamesjbutler1  @ AlexWhite34 shes never met us ,  has she ? 
9	Its finally white in Plymouth !  Shame its been caused by 30 seconds of extremely heavy hail ,  not snow  :  / 
9	I meant better people ,   love them morethan anything in the world  # unilife  # espeshstace
9	 @ GRHathaway ahaha dont kid yourself ,  it was one meal and Stace did most of it ! 
9	 @ harrietbarter its horrible !  !  Some how it has something to do with Englands history ,  but Id rather stick with the red and white shirt
9	England are walking them in now !  32 - 14 it could really happen !  ! 
9	 @ Caroline _ 956 nope ,  just a lot of rain  :  ( 
9	After the British cycling coach is injured in a crash on the same day as Wiggins ,  police are looking for an American wearing a yellow jersey
9	Its so good to be back home !  Had a funny night with  @ Caroline _ 956 and the family ,  dog included !  Got harlem shake stuck in my head though
9	Just cleaned up after a training session in a mud bath !  Had a great time and wish it was as good at Plymouth  # sadlynot  # goodstartto2013
9	Waldrom gets picked over Morgan for the England v Fiji game ,  yet in the Gloucester  -  Leicester match Waldrom was out classed by Morgan ! 
9	Four games of the RWC 2015 are to be played at Kingsholm ,  one of only two stadiums used at club level ,  the other being Exeters Sandy Park
9	Looking forward to Gloucester v Bath ,  come on Gloucester ! 
9	Looking forward to the Lions selection today  # BritishLions2013

9	Yesss Gloucester ,  what a game ,  beating Quins 17 - 15 ,  definatly worth braving the cold for !   # thriller  # gloucesterrugby
9	The head of the Welsh Rugby Union is living in a dream land at the moment ,  which is a bit odd .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
9	Just me Dan Lydicates parents and now off to the Gold Coast ,  but really looking forward to seeing the 1st Test tomorrow !   # excitingtimes
9	Scrums are going to be a mess today with George clancy as ref ,  still come on England !  !  ! 
9	 @ TomMedd yes !  Just need to find some new Zealanders now .  .  .  .  .  . 
9	Probably the most productive days since being back at uni ,  with a hangover ,  I am hanging now !  !   # gettingmyheaddown
9	My flat mates are amazing I couldnt have asked for people to live with xxx
9	What a half for Gloucester !  Sarries are not on form ,  glos got a red card in the first min but are fighting hard to make it 12 - 10 to glos
9	Really not looking forward to the 21 hour flight but at least were leaving the Aussies with some  # britishweather 
9	500 words in 3 hours ,  only 1000 left ,  but Im struggling for ideas ! 
9	Stupid fire alarm
9	Stupid alarm went off twice  :  /  it didnt realise the clocks went back till 7 . 30  :  ( 
9	Just got my Accounting test back ,  got a first !   : D a - level maths is a thing of the past now  # blipontheradar
9	YESSS !  !  Well done Samoa at beating Wales 19 - 26 ! 
9	Really liked watching The Unforgetable Spike Milligan on itv  # comedyatitsbest
9	Unbelievable that the SU wont show the Gloucester game ,  but enough screens for the very few numbers of people watching WH v MC
9	Its good to be back in bed after the earlier alarm  # sleepyhead
9	Good to see durley rfc on the big stage at twickenham !  ! 
9	Should have brought Freddie Burns on to give England more go forward ,  Flood hampers any chance of scoring tries  # bbcsixnations
9	On the way to twickenham and its snowing in reading ! 
9	This has turned into a pathetic night tbh
9	Taken 2 better be good !  Were having to wait 45mins because the earlier showing sold out
9	The new engagement rules at scrum time blatantly benefit the southern hemisphere teams
9	 @ Caroline _ 956 the dog obviously ate it ,  or next doors cat ,  either way ,  the dog need more attention than those things  # dogsarethebest
9	On my way back from seeing the lions beat Australia 21 - 23 !  Such a gokd atmosphere ,  pitty Aussies complain too much ,  should learn to kick .  .  . 
9	this seems a legit excuse : 
9	My sister has passed her driving test before I have even had a lesson  :  ( 
9	Could have made more of tonight  # winsomeyoulosesome  # learnfrommistakes
9	 @ MrChrisRackley i have no idea what youre on about
9	There are more people in the world who have access to a mobile phone than a toilet  # notright  # westenisation
9	Cant wait for the vengaboys later !  ! 
9	Having a good afternoon with my family ,  even if it is for an open day  :  ) 
9	Garcia what a shot !  !   # rydercup
9	Some people these days
9	To the guy sat behind me , Just because Gloucester lost doesnt mean theyve  " become utter rubbish recently "  did you watch the quins game ?
