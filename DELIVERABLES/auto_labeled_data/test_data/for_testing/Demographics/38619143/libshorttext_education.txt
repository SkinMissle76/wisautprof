2	 @ joshgroban 6 siblings ,  5 of them younger .  DEFINTITELY have been there 
2	Do not speak -  unless it improves on silence .  I Like silence . 
2	LiveSlow .  The New motto of surferism .  until a better one comes along .

2	someones gotta lay the foundation so that others can ride the elevator
2	The skies they look so clear and the stars they feel so near ,  and my fridge is pretty stocked with food .  .  .  LIFE IS GOOD
2	 @ mwtsnx so even in englund the power goes out ?  dang .  .

2	 @ johncmayer models with low self esteem .  .  .  isnt that a bit of an oxymoron ? 
2	Surferism HAS no stance on the issues .  Make up your own mind honestly and embrace it ,  live with it ,  share it . 
2	 @ jason _ mraz  wheres the balance between making great music and making music that sells ? 
2	Surferism is a way of life .  It asks not where are you going ,  but where are you at .
