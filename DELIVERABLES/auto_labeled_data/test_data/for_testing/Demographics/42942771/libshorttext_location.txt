37	I dont think You should call yourself an artist or singer ,  if your backing track is 70 %  of your act and  " Say Yeah "  is the other 30 %   # SB47
37	I would have prefered it if they got Rob - Dow - Jnr out and did a Iron Man Skit for the Iron Man 3 trailer .  would have been more interesting . 
37	Watching Beyonce not even sing most of the half time show is one of the reasons i like REAL LIVE Bands ,  no backing track with them .
