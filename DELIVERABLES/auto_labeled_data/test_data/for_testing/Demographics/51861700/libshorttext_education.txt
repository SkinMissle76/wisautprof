2	Here is the interview with Roberto conducted by  @ bluekippercom  @ nsno  @ grandoldteam  @ SOS1878  @ wsagfanzine  & amp ;  myself 
2	When Roberto Met The Followtonians 
2	Have you heard ‘Roberto Martinez Meets the Followtonians’ by Followtonians on  # SoundCloud ?  
2	Boooooo
2	Ha ha brilliant

2	 @ AaronBall1878 like sex panther
2	 @ JohnnyMilburn loads ! 
2	When you hear the interview Roberto Martinez has just given us you will have goosebumps ,  the man oozes class ! 
2	Just spent an hour and a half in Roberto  Martinezs company ,  what a man ! 
2	 @ jjbarker  @ THT1878 clubs tend to be quite quiet about academy players
2	 @ djdavebennett  @ daviddownie17 bah humbug !  I think they are great and bring money to the city
2	 @ kyle _ newman  @ soccerdiva also has a very British mans complexion ! 
2	 @ ScouseTims  @ Macca26efc cant argue
2	 @ GrahamDevine17 Mal
2	Hed be lamped without the cameraman
2	How much do I have to hate yourself for your mask face to be ugly ? 
2	Oh god the Everton tea party isnt going to be like this is it ?  !  ?  ! 
2	 @ Channel4 might as well put Brookside back on to complete the humiliation
2	 @ Jelpiero thats too sensible
2	 @ GrahamDevine17 living doll mask ? 
2	 @ Jelpiero what stacking selves ?  It would proof they were right . 
2	 @ Jelpiero voluntary work should be something that helps them or others not slave labour
2	Its like a really shit superhero convention
2	 @ Jelpiero drives me mad too ,  but seeing ppl have to use food banks drives me far madder
2	 @ GrahamDevine17 Labour can only get in with working class vote so have to trust theyll fight for them now hopefully that new labour is gone
2	 @ Jelpiero course it is ,  yes some ppl work system but know where near what its made out to be ,  just propaganda
2	Jelavic being linked with .  .  .  .  . Celtic
2	 @ AK4INSURANCE Mr Balls will keep him in check ! 
2	 @ Jelpiero and still con billions out of the system ,  the welfare state is being victimised for a tiny  %  of ppl
2	 @ GrahamDevine17 damage is done tho isnt it ,   the measures are normally irreversible like the privatisations in the 80s  & amp ;  90s
2	 @ Jelpiero do u honestly know how small a percentage it really is ?  Its buttons
2	 @ Jelpiero dear me
2	 @ AK4INSURANCE hes not his brother but I live in hope
2	 @ NickfromNews scary ! 
2	 @ GrahamDevine17 they are making sure their mates take our money via NHS  & amp ;  Royal Mail etc ,  it all flows back to them
2	White chicks ! 
2	 @ GrahamDevine17 They gain their own country ,  where they  & amp ;  there friends continue to privatise everything and run it
