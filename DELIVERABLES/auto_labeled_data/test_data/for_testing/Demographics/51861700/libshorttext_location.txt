18	 @ KennyWFDLive  @ PhilSchoen been an awful year for U . S players ,  either going back to MLS or just failing miserably in EPL
18	 @ HJEFC92  @ WD1878 every top football team will be following suit if they get own way
18	Messi  # Worldsbest
18	 @ SoCalEverton  @ Everton good player

18	 @ bazza0151 ha ,  ye I want him there on my deathbed
18	15000 DL in 24 hours ,  Just wow !   # brownshoes 
18	 @ ALANMYERS1  @ THT1878 its not a choice its a calling
18	Messi bitch ! 
18	 @ bazza0151 youd only get one sole of Robertos for that
18	Two things that havent changed tonight ,  the Barca 2nd keeper is still rubbish  & amp ;  Jack Whitehall continues not to be funny
18	 @ THT1878  @ ALANMYERS1 ye always did ,  plus Dunc clocked one of their players
18	 @ UpperGwladysBlu yes had a great day in Lisbon
18	Ok Ill rephrase that ,  so your 6 - 0 down ,  fat Sam is the manager and its £42 ,  would you go ?

18	The Kumars and Birds of a feather back ?  !  ?  Right call my agent ! 
18	 @ B _ Thornley I only begrudge the fact they play without rules financially
18	I hate this idea that the likes of Alladyce  & amp ;  Pulis will make your team hard to beat  & amp ;  play a game that will get you results ,  total nonsense
18	Remember when City had no strikers ?  !  ? 
18	 @ stebutlerefc  @ neiljroberts1  @ ALANMYERS1  @ Everton Im a professional ! 
18	 @ THT1878 £9m well spent !   # ohwait

18	Listen to my interview with Roberto Martinez now… 
18	You wont be disappointed with the interview ,  the man is absolutely superb
18	Here is the interview with Roberto conducted by  @ bluekippercom  @ nsno  @ grandoldteam  @ SOS1878  @ wsagfanzine  & amp ;  myself 
18	When Roberto Met The Followtonians 
18	Have you heard ‘Roberto Martinez Meets the Followtonians’ by Followtonians on  # SoundCloud ?  
18	Boooooo
18	Ha ha brilliant
18	Have you heard ‘Roberto Martinez Followtonians intro’ by Followtonians on  # SoundCloud ?  
18	Will get the interview out ASAP via  @ Followtonians
18	 @ AaronBall1878 like sex panther
18	 @ JohnnyMilburn loads ! 
18	When you hear the interview Roberto Martinez has just given us you will have goosebumps ,  the man oozes class ! 
18	Just spent an hour and a half in Roberto  Martinezs company ,  what a man ! 
18	 @ jjbarker  @ THT1878 clubs tend to be quite quiet about academy players
18	 @ djdavebennett  @ daviddownie17 bah humbug !  I think they are great and bring money to the city
18	 @ kyle _ newman  @ soccerdiva also has a very British mans complexion ! 
18	 @ ScouseTims  @ Macca26efc cant argue
18	 @ GrahamDevine17 Mal
18	Hed be lamped without the cameraman
18	How much do I have to hate yourself for your mask face to be ugly ? 
18	Oh god the Everton tea party isnt going to be like this is it ?  !  ?  ! 
18	 @ Channel4 might as well put Brookside back on to complete the humiliation
18	 @ Jelpiero thats too sensible
18	 @ GrahamDevine17 living doll mask ? 
18	 @ Jelpiero what stacking selves ?  It would proof they were right . 
18	 @ Jelpiero voluntary work should be something that helps them or others not slave labour
18	Its like a really shit superhero convention
18	 @ Jelpiero drives me mad too ,  but seeing ppl have to use food banks drives me far madder
18	 @ GrahamDevine17 Labour can only get in with working class vote so have to trust theyll fight for them now hopefully that new labour is gone
18	 @ Jelpiero course it is ,  yes some ppl work system but know where near what its made out to be ,  just propaganda
18	Jelavic being linked with .  .  .  .  . Celtic
18	 @ AK4INSURANCE Mr Balls will keep him in check ! 
18	 @ Jelpiero and still con billions out of the system ,  the welfare state is being victimised for a tiny  %  of ppl
18	 @ GrahamDevine17 damage is done tho isnt it ,   the measures are normally irreversible like the privatisations in the 80s  & amp ;  90s
18	 @ Jelpiero do u honestly know how small a percentage it really is ?  Its buttons
18	 @ Jelpiero dear me
18	 @ AK4INSURANCE hes not his brother but I live in hope
18	 @ NickfromNews scary ! 
18	 @ GrahamDevine17 they are making sure their mates take our money via NHS  & amp ;  Royal Mail etc ,  it all flows back to them
18	White chicks ! 
18	 @ GrahamDevine17 They gain their own country ,  where they  & amp ;  there friends continue to privatise everything and run it
