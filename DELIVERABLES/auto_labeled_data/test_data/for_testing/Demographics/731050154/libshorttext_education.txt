2	 @ RVacchianoNYDN If the Giants lose ,  I put the loss on Gilbride
2	 @ MarkHerzlich 58 is great !  
2	 @ Yankees bench ARod
2	The NFL has a good product .  Any team can win in any given year .  That being said ,  the product is being compromised due the replacement refs
2	 @ Yankees  @ cgrand14 too bad hes not even batting 240 .  Fire Kevin Long
2	 @ Yankees Kevin Long doesnt deserve to be the batting coach for a T - ball team
2	 @ RVacchianoNYDN Rolle was no help on the play either ,  over ran himself right out of the picture
2	 @ Yankees just in time to strike out with men in base
2	 @ Yankees Arod back in the lineup .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . so he can strike out with men on base . 
2	 @ CarlBanksGIII One of the greatest linebackers ever to suit up for the Giants !  
2	 @ MarkHerzlich Nice game ,  I hope weve found our starting MLB for the decade ! 
2	 @ RVacchianoNYDN What is your opinion of Herzlich so far in camp ?
