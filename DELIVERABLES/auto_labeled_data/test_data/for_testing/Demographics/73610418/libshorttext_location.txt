33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne voila !   
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne an improvement on my last one ! 
33	 @ MillaisDoll do you remember sorting these for me :   .  .  .  Hasnt got any smaller !   
33	Luxembourg Grund 
33	On my way the airport .  Adventure nearly at an end  :  ( 
33	Found an amazing backstreet cafe :  Maries House for lunch . 
33	 - 26 C .  .  .  bottle of water Ive had in my bag has almost frozen solid ! 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne I fancied a change after 4 ice lollies
33	Im on the bus to Svolvaer .  Narvik is the northernmost place Im visiting .  From now onwards Ill be heading back south . 
33	Warmer today  (  - 15 C )  .  Off to Narvik  -  supposed to be a very scenic journey .  But time for coffee first . 
33	According to my I survived the Ice Hotel diploma it reaches  -  30 C last night ! 
33	Ok Ive found a way to upload photos .  Be prepared for an onslaught ! 
33	Surprisingly large number of things to do in Bodo for such a small place . 
33	In an hour Im moving on to Roro ,  a UNESCO World Heritage former mining town by train . 
33	Busy day ahead .  6 hour snow mobile  & amp ;  ice fishing tours his morning ,  dog sledding in evening and then a night in the Ice Hotel ! 
33	Ok so that wasnt too bad
33	 @ nata _ angele huskies .  .  .   
33	I think Ive exhausted all the interesting things in Bodo .  Which means drinking and eating until the train . 
33	Cold morning in Luxembourg . 
33	Wow  -  dont expect to come across an orchestra playing in the town sq on a  Monday evening 
33	Today Im heading up the Rhine by boat to a small town called Bacharach . 
33	Still on bus ,  93 km from Svolvaer .  Very clear skies and few artificial lights .  Good chance of seeing lights again tonight . 
33	SEEN THEM ! 
33	 @ Frontera2 not worth a visit when Im in Bruges next month ? 
33	Dont think Ill be getting any prize winning shots tonight
33	About to visit the Historium .  .  .  an interactive tour thing that activates  " all five senses " 
33	Waiting for the snowmobile trip to begin .  .  . 
33	And dusk over Svolvaer .  .  .  
33	Heidelberg definitely up there amongst the most attractive places Ive visited . 
33	
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne thanks  :  ) 
33	
33	Ok I feel like seeing a film tonight  -  since Ive run out of books to read need something else to fill my time . 
33	Morning from Bruges .  Going to try a d squeeze a visit to Damme in before Eurostar home . 
33	Northern Lights  -  beat yet tonight !  Wish my bloody tripod was taller though !

33	 @ Crampolino  @ iamgreatwhite well I had to do something in return for working Xmas Eve ,  New Years Eve and about a million other RDs ! 
33	 @ MillaisDoll Ive afraid to cash them in case it backrupts the cafes !  Super thanks ,  yourself ?

33	Going in a boat trip around the fjords this morning
33	Arrived in Paris and making my way over to Gare de LEst . 
33	In my little pouch ,  of what I thought was Norwegian coins ,  Ive found Swedish ,  Czech ,  Slovakian and Moldovan currency .  . 
33	Just boarded Bodo to Trondheim night train .  Step above anything we have in UK . 
33	300 pages so should keep me going for a few days until I can get at my stash of about 3 million books to read at home . 
33	This is the route Ive taken today from Abisko  ( red pin )  to Svovaer  ( purple pin )  
33	Great view of N Lights tonight .  Photos will follow tomorrow .  Now Im off to Ice Bar .

33	Leaving Kiruna now for Abisko .  Train only 30 minutes late this time !

33	Slow and ponderous journey down to Narvik but frozen lakes ,  rivers and snow covered forest a fantastic scene

33	Waiting for boat to take me to St Goar  -  one of the most attractive parts of the river valley . 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne I dont like Pimms .  Plus it must have been a rubbish party if it was relying on me to keep it interesting ! 
33	Perfectly clear sky tonight  =  good chance to see the Northern Lights .  Scouting a good vantage point . 
33	Great display over Solvaer .  Hard to photograph though with lots of street lights .  This was about the best I could do .  
33	Im saying goodbye to Sweden today and hello to Norway .  Shortly leaving on a train for Narvik where Ill have a few hours . 
33	Sipping some local red wine at a terrace bar overlooking Worms Cathedral .

33	Just docking in Bodo now .  About 10 hours until the train to Trondheim .

33	 @ Daves _ World1 yes .  .  .  its an aviation museum .  .  .  .

33	Finished all the books I brought with me .  .  .  what am I to do now ! 
33	So back to a cafe for lunch and reading .  I knew it was wise to bring two 600 page books with me . 
33	Very cloudy this evening so no chance of seeing Northern Lights . 
33	 @ Frontera2 not when you have 
33	Kiruna is one of those places where everywhere ,  incl .  train station ,  shuts on a Sunday .  Very annoying when you have nowhere to go and it  .  .  . 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne Grrr .  .  . 
33	So I have no phone signal in Woking but it functions fine 530 metres under a mountain in Sweden ? 
33	Off to the cinema again tonight . 
33	Just about to cross border into Norway .  .  . 
33	250 metres underground and I still have phone signal ? 
33	Not possible to get there and back in time so Im on way back to Brussels
33	Time for a husky tour .  Clear sky  -  perfect conditions for light viewing . 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne  # icecreamdealer 
33	Cloud has moved in now so its back to the hotel to pack .  Very early start tomorrow . 
33	Coffee break in Ghent
33	Just found a 50 kroner note in pocket .  .  .  so the last time I wore these trousers then was when I was in Arctic in Feb ! 
33	After breakfast Im off to Koln by boat .  Changing to train in Koblenz . 
33	Well the show was totally pointless but a good beer terrace at the end . 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne Im glad it is one of my more flattering names
33	 @ nata _ angele â€¦ Northern Lights last night from Ice Hotel 
33	Arrived in Oslo now . 
33	Train very modern and outfitted to very high standard .  Could have been built in the last few years but might be wrong . 
33	Exploring Bonn ,  birthplace of Beethoven . 
33	This is what they looked like to the naked eye .  .  
33	 @ Nata _ Angele yes !  Any other demands ?  hehe . 
33	I dont spend all day drinking just in case my tweets give that impression
33	This memory card obviously spent some time in my work phone  -  photos of broken urinals and flood socks .  .  . 
33	 @ Nata _ Angele why wait ?  I filmed a husky sled ride last night from the front seat .  1 min video turned into 5 ,  Shutter button froze open ! 
33	A frozen waterfall in Abisko last night .  .  .  
33	 @ iamgreatwhite it doesnt Im afraid .  My knowledge of M Python is very patchy . 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne  @ DavidWhitley74 like a ninja . 
33	Beer cheese pizza ?  Disappointed horse isnt on menu
33	 @ Nata _ Angele perhaps if you went to the Norwegian Ice Hotel which is further north ? 
33	The sky has cleared up a little so I might get the change to see the Northern Lights again tonight afterall . 
33	Warming up before going on another photography session
33	Platter of Swedish treats for dinner :  bread ,  moose ,  reindeer ,  cheese .  .  . 
33	Travelling along the Malmbanen in Sweden 
33	 @ EmmaJGascoigne BBQ ! 
33	Husky trip amazing ! 
33	First attempt at photographing Northern Lights .  .  .  more practice needed .   
33	Thats 7 people  -  locals and tourists  -  that have asked me for train info at Brussels Midi .  Do I just have that look ? 
33	Reading by candlelight .  .  .  feel like a monk . 
33	In moderation of course .  Norwegian prices .  .  .  sheesh ! 
33	Very glad I stayed but probably wouldnt do it again .  Slept well but walk across  - 26 C snow in pjs to from room a killer ! 
33	Taking a break at Norsk Luftfartsmuseum . 
33	 @ Frontera2 151 knots ? 
33	Its 2 degrees C outside .  I think thats the first time Ive experienced temperatures above 0 in the past two weeks ! 
33	Spoke to soon .  Dont appear to be able to upload photos .  Had same problem yesterday .  .  .  !  ? 
33	Well Germany really does shut down on a Sunday .  Im at a famous local Brauerei and Im the only patron

33	Another roasting day in Frankfurt ! 
33	Spending the day in Bodo and then taking the night train to Trondheim this evening . 
33	Just arrived in Mainz  -  off for an explore .

33	New Post !  Days 1  -  3 :  Stockholm  -  
33	Well thats a bummer  -  train running 3 hours late  ( seems a fairly typical occurrence )  so trip to Narvik aborted . 
33	Waitress at hotel is keeping me well topped up with wine .  .  .  apparently I have a special accent .  .  .  not sure it thats a compliment or not
33	Feeling very English tonight  -  fish  & amp ;  chips for dinner .  .  .  but we are by the sea so it will probably be good .

33	New Post !  Day :  6  & amp ;  7 Abisko to Narvik ,  The Malmbanan  -  
33	Sat in Bruges Markt having a local beer .  Getting cold and looks like it might rain .
