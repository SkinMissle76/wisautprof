2	 @ jbcplessex I know its late but id love to join you
2	 @ Londonneur However however noble our goals are for our local areas ,  the companies who own the lorries will always win it seems  :  ( 
2	 @ Londonneur I am all for that I dont know if you have heard of the A228 ?  its a road that leads from Thamesport that i ride full of lorries ! 
2	 @ Londonneur this was the advert if you didnt see it  :  )  
2	 @ Londonneur 2 / 2 maybe we should have similar ones for cyclists  ? 
2	 @ Londonneur do you remember that advert a few years ago where the little girl gets hit by a car at 40mph and it shows how it breaks her 1 / 2
2	 @ LozKaye  @ tpb Indeed  -  it is just getting out of control now ,  ah well glad my 6 - 7 mirrors havent been found by them yet  # timetogotofreends
2	 @ Londonneur Id probably be unconcious not just grimacing ,  not trying to argue ,  just dont feel the image shows the risk fully
2	 @ Londonneur my pain thresholds may be different to yours but im sure having my legs run over by a lorry and more than likely hitting my head
2	 @ Londonneur whilst the helmet wouldnt protect her the picture shows that yes she got hit but she looks fine .  Either way the image isnt good
2	 @ tpb  @ LozKaye UK Police Orders Registrars to Suspend Domains of Torrent Sites :  The newly founded .  .  .  .  
2	 @ Londonneur I love that whilst trying to promote safety they have gone nah she dont need a helmet  : p
2	 @ TheckPhD thanks ,  just after raid time so yeah good for me  :  ) 
2	 @ TheckPhD Thanks  -   ( tries to work out time difference )  I think its during my raid time but hey its pally tanking TOT hit it and wait to win
2	 @ TheckPhD hmmm okey dokey ill take a look  -  my WA experience extends as far as looking to see what you did and trying to mimic it  : P
2	 @ TheckPhD and I assume I am right in thinking that this is the debuff ?  
2	 @ TheckPhD Yeah I use all your other prot ones  :  )  have also done my own for meta gem procs  -  but cant seem to get one counting down the 2 min
2	 @ TheckPhD dont suppose by any chance you have done a weak aura to track the tank legendary cape cool down ? 
2	 @ cutaia _ net  @ AskMrRobot I know what you mean but in saying that I have yet to ser a boss that drops an item I want from the prot table lol
2	 @ AskMrRobot is this reference my druid ?  If so its still wrong unbuffed you have me at 29 %  but Im actually at 17 % 
2	 @ cutaia _ net  @ AskMrRobot remember whilst blizz like the use of haste for protadins they didnt intend for it to be our main stat  :  ) 
2	 @ AskMrRobot you appear to be having some issues today ,  haste is off compared to the armory  
2	 @ BlizzardCSEU _ EN I want a demonology druid / rogue / monk now please ,  looted by druid not a warlock  :  )

2	 @ NayrTheGooner  @ Heallarious  @ PC _ Gamer odd i had 100 +  lol
2	 @ Heallarious  @ PC _ Gamer  @ BlizzardCS more than likely not but I dont imagine blizz will be happy with people selling on a free key for £150 ! 
2	 @ PC _ Gamer Technical problems traslation :  shit we done fucked up now best cover our asses gl explaining that to  @ BlizzardCS
2	 @ Heallarious I do think its excellent evidently  @ PC _ Gamer are not trustworthy enough to get the keys in the first place  @ BlizzardCS
2	 @ Heallarious  @ PC _ Gamer they dont even have the courage to admit that they got hacked !  ah well say good bye to a 10 year subscriber lol
2	 @ Heallarious  @ PC _ Gamer  just search for hearthstone beta on ebay and click worldwide  : P but dont go buying one its in violation of TOS
2	 @ PC _ Gamer well what a good show  -  not even a comment from you and over 100 beta keys have shown up on ebay in the last 20 mins fail ! 
2	 @ PC _ Gamer wait there was a giveaway ?  all i saw was a wall of this page is broken and cant load lol  -  get better servers guys !
