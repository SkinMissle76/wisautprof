28	Amazing service from  @ ToolstationUK  -  order placed yesterday afternoon  ( Sunday )  ,  and its here already ! 
28	 @ Doctor _ Hutch On a positive note ,  buying an electric toothbrush for someone to help clean their bike could be unexpected and welcome ! 
28	 @ CXHelen  @ ChallengeTires Youre way below the recommended pressure for those tyres .   Arent you running the risk of pinch flats ? 
28	Nice !  Son Tristan got a photo in todays EDP for his super ride  (  & amp ;  wearing  # nufc shorts )  in Sundays cyclocross 
28	Route Builder by  @ Strava seems to work rather well ;  could be especially useful in unfamiliar territory .   More info :  
28	Mac OSX and iOS just got a bit closer .  Mobile apps can send push notifications to Mavericks ,  and on to your website !  
28	 @ tripleox  @ searchmartin Thanks for this  -  tracking bots in GA works a treat ,  and is great to watch in Real - Time mode !   # Analytics
28	About to take number 1 teenage son for a haircut .  Yes ,  this is a big deal . 
28	 @ JoeFletch I cant decide whether he was being facetious or just naive !   Probably neither ,  but Im none the wiser anyway . 
28	I really dont know what to make of this small website survey from  @ mattcutts :   
28	My Windows 7 laptop had a BSOD when coming out of sleep mode  -  rather disconcerting ! 
28	Another PHP photo upload tool completed  -  this time its for uploading to Wikimedia .   MediaWiki documentation was very helpful ! 
28	Just spent hours getting Minecraft working again on family PC ,  after removing Nvidia graphics card .  Energy - sapping ,  but got there in the end
28	 @ si _ lumb  @ ruskin147  @ carlton I entirely concur with this ;  Minecraft is  ( or can be )  a powerful learning tool .  Very addictive for my kids too ! 
28	 @ Jim _ Clayton Whoops ,  thanks Jim !  I definitely meant Norwich City .   Theyre a very tasteful green  :  ) 
28	RU Y2K OK ?   This is possibly the lamest thing that we were given in the run - up to the year 2000 
28	 @ MurrayGorman blimey ,  I hope thats mud .  .  . 
28	 @ powerofthegroup  @ SeniorBuyingPwr Great video .   This scheme could really help to make heating oil more affordable ! 
28	High frequency trading being investigated on Radio 4 .  Such a parasitic  & amp ;  absurd financial instrument ,  symptomatic of short - termism
28	WOW !  Google App Engine has a  " Mobile Backend Starter for iOS "  ,  and you can code it in PHP !  
28	 @ Jim _ Clayton Nice one Jim .   Bit easier than riding a 12 - hr ! 
28	Wow ,  I was pictured on page 2 of the EDP today !   Bit of a step up from the back pages .   # cycling 
28	 @ CXHelen Oh ,  but very well done of course !   You certainly know your stuff  :  ) 
28	 @ ruskin147  @ bbc5live All at once or one at a time ? 
28	Tip of the day ,  if you do a lot of uploading over an ADSL line :  if its around 400kbps ,  ask your ISP to remove the uplink limit . 
28	Bitvise SSH client for Windows ,  with keypair support .   Why didnt I know about this before ?  ?   # sysadmin
28	Such a nice day out there ,  and Im stuck indoors doing paperwork !  
28	Twitters moving to 64 - bit user IDs .  Check your app code against  @ Overflow64 and  @ 64Flavors accounts 
28	Im about to start work migrating a poorly written site over to Symfony .   It can only get better ,  right ? 
28	Such a wet and miserable day for a trip to Norwich !   I think Ill take the train ,  but will cycle home  -  into a strong headwind  :  / 
28	 @ Jim _ Clayton  @ amisvelo Its going to be a very muddy one ,  I suspect ! 
28	Finally got around to coding a tool for uploading my website photos to Flickr .   phpFlickr is just the client for this ! 
28	 @ digitalreality I cant see anything missing from updated Google Drive app .   UI feels cleaner ,  with added thumbnail previews . 
28	Google +  launches vanity urls .   Mine is 
28	 @ tripleox Sort it ,  Mark !   You should have two or three bikes ,  at a bare minimum .   Even when its windy  & amp ;  rainy  :  ) 
28	 @ LeVelo _ UK Good advice ,  and its very tempting ! 
28	 @ Jim _ Clayton Youre right  -  Daniel Bloy  ( Kings Lynn CC )  is pictured .   Well done with your PB btw ! 
28	 @ InstantWild All I get is this message that a cameras subscription is already active  -  but it isnt !  
28	Alternatives to landline broadband discussed on BBC  # YouandYours  -  but no mention of satellite broadband !  Definitely a viable option . 
28	eBay sign - in appears to be failing .   I wouldnt bother with a password reset  -  just wait until theyve sorted it !   # outage
28	That was a satisfying ,  but taxing ,  CSS refactoring :  1100 lines added ;  12300 lines deleted . 
28	Phew ,  huge fry - up for 5 hungry kids is now over .  Bacon ,  sausage ,  eggs ,  beans ,  mushrooms ,  tomatoes ,  waffles ,  fried bread  -  and nothing burnt ! 
28	Got some feedback for  @ google search policies ?   Let them know here :  
28	Sons iPad2  ( on iOS7 )  froze on him the other night .   Wouldnt even respond to holding silver button down .   Had to let battery drain down ! 
28	A photo I took at Sundays cyclocross may appear in tomorrows EADT .   Cycling enthusiasts ,  get a copy ! 
28	Gutted that Im missing first round of Eastern Cross at Basildon today .   Hope everyone there has a great time on slippery grass !   # cyclocross
28	 @ digitalreality Three bikes is the bare minimum .   Keep em coming ! 
28	 @ powerofthegroup Agreed .  Its not really about when you buy your oil  ( within reason )  ,  its really about who you buy it from . 
28	 @ KaptainKosmic Thanks !   It was at the Gas Hill Gasp ,  not one of my better events .  .  . 
28	Eastern region cyclocross membership is finally open !   First event is on 7 September ,  so dont delay .  
28	 @ KaptainKosmic Just keep away as long as you can !   Being caught is inevitable ,  for once . 
28	 @ Kwdmiller  @ TimothyOShea Thats good .  Im sure that youve covered worst - case scenarios ,  but it still must be a tough nut to crack
28	Pinterest now has a RESTful API ,  so you can find most popular pins and a domains own pins 
28	Twitter Ads is now available in the UK and Ireland !  
28	Very nice to be sitting outside with coffee  & amp ;  cookies ,  after a productive coding session . 
28	 @ ruskin147 Thats the surprise !   Id have expected the company to retain almost all of the windfall for re - investment . 
28	 @ Onebigpedal  @ AllegaertK Well done to you and all the other competitors in this huge trans - continental bike race ! 
28	 @ lovenorfolk  @ tripleox Dandy Horse is great !  I enjoyed a coffee there with local cycling journalist ,  whilst bike safely stowed out back . 
28	En route to London for business meeting .  Sunny warm day ;  would like to have cycled part of way .  Not to be ! 
28	 @ ruskin147 I made small  # Vodafone investment a few years ago ;  liked company and good dividend .  Latest pay - out news is surprising to me . 
28	 @ CXHelen Point taken  -  keep the info coming !   Very helpful insights into top cx racing . 
28	 @ RossTricker For a moment there I thought youd wrecked a turbo trainer .  .  .  wouldnt put it past you ! 
28	 @ KathrynWright81 Crikey ,  I hope you have a good ride ,  and dont sprint for too many segments ! 
28	Wonderful to be riding cyclocross again !   # 2 son Tristan enjoyed it too .   Photos  & amp ;  video here 
28	Great support and quick fix from Alan at  @ scriptrock when node diffs failed to load .   Its such a useful sysadmin web service ! 
28	 @ johnbfagan Well done John ,  youre in great shape !   The trampoline somersault challenge sounds harder though  -  be careful  :  ) 
28	About time ,  too !  UK government scraps the paper car tax disc 
28	 @ CXHelen  @ ChallengeTires Quite agree .  I love riding on Challenge Griffo open tyres ,  they really inspire confidence ! 
28	 @ Jules _ Foto I think you meant  @ GraemeObree
28	 @ jaytay Thanks for the tip ,  Jim .   Id be surprised if my son hadnt tried that ,  though  -  he was getting pretty desperate !   # ios7
28	 @ KaptainKosmic Not me ,  Andy  -  Ive been trapped at home all day !   Will hopefully nip out tomorrow for the GYCC hill - climb though . 
28	Ooh ,  Ive just won a tree from Yeo Valley  & amp ;  The Woodland Trust !  Licking that yoghurt pot lid really paid off . 
28	 @ Simone _ E _ Morris Thanks for that !   Heres the Royal Mail web page about it ,  for anyone wanting more info :  
28	Inbox segregation is a good enough reason for me to stop using the gmail iOS app .   Its back to Apples default mail app for me . 
28	I like the idea of  @ InstantWild to help identify creatures from motion - sensitive cameras ,  but cant get the iphone app to work .  Frustrating ! 
28	Getting packed up for cyclocross tomorrow  ( Eastern Cross ,  round 2 )  Damn ,  theres a lot of stuff needed ! 
28	Aah ,  that sense of relief when a clients website runs without modification in your development environment  :  ) 
28	Shout - out to Norfolk folk :  Wroxham is apparently gridlocked due to roadworks .   Go there at your peril !   ( unless youre on a bike of course ) 
28	 @ kassyassin No beer fest for me ,  Kass .   Im too busy with family stuff !   Hope you have a good time  :  ) 
28	Displaying contents of files with non - standard extensions  ( eg  . php )  in Windows preview pane 
28	Slightly blown away :  eldest son hacking Minecraft by writing JSON !   ( Whilst listening to Led Zeppelin ,  which is a little  surreal .  ) 
28	 @ godriccycling Id give the Stoke Holy Cross hill - climb a go myself ,  but cant miss the Hilly Fields cyclocross in Colchester
28	 @ Jim _ Clayton Excellent  # 12hr distance there Jim ,  well done ! 
28	Strava has released a new API !   It uses oAuth and has a generous usage limit .   I hope they dont withdraw it like they did the last one . 
28	 @ ianpegg Dont think that I have time for Epic .   It does look good though ! 
28	 @ TimothyOShea jFloat self - insurance looks flawed to me .   Surely the main point of insurance is to protect against massive liabilities ? 
28	 @ jaytay Fantastic reading !  Our kids have read our Calvin  & amp ;  Hobbes collection so much over the years that theyre falling apart
28	 @ tripleox Thats a great article  -  Ill try and find a few minutes later to have a play !   # bot  # Analytics
28	Wondering how the Eastern Cross seniors race is progressing .  .  .   & lt ; sigh & gt ; 
28	Fancy owning a brick or two of Legoland ?   Merlin Entertainment plans to go public 
28	About to hear from  @ powerofthegroup talking about community buying on BBC Oxford 
28	RainBird is an AI platform ,  using reasoning for problem solving ,  thats due to launch soon .  Sign up here :
