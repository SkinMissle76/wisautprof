6	 @ TheFinanceCoach No way !  Who did that ?  !  And how did you find out ? 
6	So ,  what do I have to do to get a Keynote slot at  # IFPConf next year ? 
6	 @ martinbamford Very cool  -  will watch it later .  Did I fawn over you last week ?  !

6	 @ nucleus _ lisa  @ david _ ferguson I amJealous David ! 
6	 @ EmmaNapier Thansk Emma ,  youre not wrong ! 
6	 @ mel _ kenny Important to be real ,  you’re right .  I rarely have such days ,  and I hate it when others whine . 
6	 @ witchwebnet Was a bit chilly here today .  Got down to 4 degrees  ;  -  )  Thanks very much for Christmas card by the way ,  very kind  :  -  ) 
6	Just come off another Live Q & amp ; A Conference call with Advisertech members .  Great to share and learn from each other :  
6	 @ APeterWray Depends on your email system .  They differ widely .  Between free and £50 per month
6	 " IFTTT adds a location channel to its iOS App "   
6	Excellent .  My every - other - day offer of a month free LinkedIn Premium has arrived in my inbox .   # no
6	 @ BridgetFSM Good effort . 
6	 @ MatthewWalne Yes .  I am rethinking some stuff tonight ,  believe me ! 
6	 @ TonySanchez1 Bah humbug !  Were all just media tarts looking for someone to say they love us ! 
6	 @ APeterWray I know you’re a member !  Wondered what you thought about letting the world in to see the site ,  rather than just the landing page
6	 @ DuncanRatley Don’t be daft ,  man !  Hope things are going well for you ! 
6	 @ MarkJohnson _ IFA Thanks Mark .  It is working well for me .  Well be covering podcasting next month on 
6	 @ Jenny _ Smyth  @ cssgareth The fact that you FEEL your business is the reason you will win .   # fact

6	 @ sheffield _ ifa Would be a unique approach ,  I admit .  .  . 
6	 @ AbrahamOnMoney  @ TheParaplanner  @ cssgareth It should be OK ,  get the best processor ,  16GB RAM and SSD if you’re serious .  I would go 15” tho . 
6	 @ ChrisDaems  @ poppyredLife People dont trust  ( most )  brands or corporate suits .  FWIW I think Chriss blogs model authenticity in the best way
6	After a roundly crappy day ,  90 minutes of watching  @ garyvee and  @ chasejarvis is just what I needed .  Fired up again and ready to hit tomorrow
6	My word of the day is Counterpart . Make a note of it Darling .  I like it ,  and want to use it more in conversation . 
6	 @ cssgareth Cant see its worth the money unless youre editing 4K video .  I can get a monster spec iMac for £2 , 500

6	Reckon we could do with this in the UK :  
6	 @ simonjryan Ah ,  cheers Simon ! 
6	 @ MatthewWalne not too bad .  We complete Monday but will move in bits and pieces over the week ,  and in properly on Saturday after Xmas
6	 @ cjscullion Gotta love compliance .  If they block it ,  I’d love to know why !
