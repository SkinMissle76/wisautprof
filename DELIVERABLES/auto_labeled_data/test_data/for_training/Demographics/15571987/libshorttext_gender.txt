-1	Spring in step after long say .  Ended with a couple of hugely inspiring conversations with 11 Ambassadors  @ TeachFirst .  Changemakers all . 
-1	 @ chrishall03 agree  -  not enough of the how and too much retrospective back - patting  -  which makes the politics cloud the results . 
-1	 @ Mitchell _ Nat that choon never gets old .  rerewind .  craig david ! 
-1	terrible times :  accidental tiger balm ache to eye cross contamination .  worse than onions but better than actual crying .
