19	 @ dtearl you should know  " Born To Run "  is playing in the Smithy right now ,  to fire you up for the ride . 
19	 @ dtearl this .  Also ,  evil Nemanja is evil . 
19	There is a pretender to the Nemanja name !  This is not okay . 
19	 @ dtearl  @ GWcolonialhoops as an alumnus of both these schools ,  I must say that Rack Em is pretty great .  Also ,   # raisehigh . 
19	 @ GoTeamMegan Benghazi ? 
19	 @ carigervin I once thought Willie Mae was real ,  but the shtick is getting outlandish .  That said ,  satire in the Chattanoogan ?  Its perfect . 
19	 @ dorieturner I have this vision of it being called Lochs when its Scottish salmon now .  Im pleased with this . 
19	 @ ButMadNNW HOORAY !  YOU WILL SUCCEED AT THIS ! 
19	 @ GWcolonialhoops and some luck .  Ugh . 
19	 @ GWcolonialhoops God bless you for finding that .  Also ,  was he on Americas Kidz Got Singing ? 
19	I will concede that Marylands appropriation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles song is good .  But they do not look so fearsome .

19	And my IPhone rewards me for my optimism with  " Miracle at South Bend ,  "  the John Ward playcall of the 1991 Tennessee - Notre Dame game . 
19	Today will be crazy :  crazy good .  Im declaring this to be so . 
19	 @ DisneyHipsters I have no idea how this thought had not crossed my mind ,  but now Im sad .

19	 @ dtearl Everyone needs a little fun now and then !

19	 @ PastorAmyDC not weird . 
19	 @ HermsTheWord If its at the McDonalds Im thinking of ?  No . 
19	 @ NoodlesinCHI isnt this amazing ?  I want that mascot . 
19	Hey  @ wmata ,  how is it possible for you to suck so much ?   # redline
19	Sadness is a loud day  @ hulagirltruck leading to extra rice and no mac salad ,  when I wanted the opposite !   # bequietgenerators
19	 @ GWcolonialhoops  # contraband
19	 @ GWcolonialhoops wait ,  do they sell gummi cherries in here ?  Thats huge if so . 
19	The good guys ate their wheaties at halftime ,  apparently !  Up 21 .   # raisehigh
19	 @ Colonialhoops Also ,  I approve of the first half all the way . 
19	 @ GWcolonialhoops but they need a broom !  Also ,  the three legged race has great potential . 
19	GW basketball season :  mascot trips leading team into floor ,  head falls off ;  new PA guy calls star Armstrong ,  name is Armwood .   # raisehigh
19	Trip in from Silver Spring has been nuts ,  too .  RT  @ CeceliaJP :  WTH red line ?   12 people deep lines at gallery place !  !   @ wmata

19	 @ BEImlay Ooo !  Which one ?  Which one ?  ? 
19	 @ myramt never stop tweeting . 
19	 @ dtearl indeed !  The Nemanjament is looking like his old self from downtown ,  which is a beautiful thing . 
19	 @ dtearl Im just saying :  Smith Center is missing a little something today ,  man .  Hope Cali is good ! 
19	 @ allysonrobinson Ha !  They invented cloaking technology years ago . 
19	 @ ClayTravisBGID the key here is you trying not to laugh when he said  " Maryland had to get it in the back door last week .  " 
19	Of course John beat me to this .  RT  @ jbtaylor :   @ PastorAmyDC We need to check on their survey methodology . 
19	 @ PastorAmyDC This survey confuses me .  34 percent of non - Christan millennials read Scripture on their cell phones ?  That seems .  .  .  very off . 
19	 @ MKPony The mustache alone . 
19	Always love an  @ rachelnoelj sighting on the metro ,  even in passing ! 
19	 @ BEImlay to her ,  it may be !  Also ,  dinner soon ? 
19	 @ dtearl As youll recall ,  such an event got me connected to  @ GWGeorge .  Rooting against the Lady Vols in Knoxville ?  That was freaking nuts . 
19	 @ dtearl Note :  singing the fight song by yourself at a sporting event will feel weird at first .  Just work through that . 
19	 @ carigervin I want to know more about this bacon peanut butter bomb .  Why would you eat marshmallows given that option ? 
19	 @ dtearl no ,  but its my evil twin ,  apparently ! 
19	 @ myramt he is squirreling that away for me !  I asked him to ! 
19	 @ myramt No .  Freaking .  Way .  Did we let him return them ? 
19	 @ Bravesmeme The real question :  when can we start watching baseball every night again ?   # hotstove
19	 @ duffellduffell I love you ,  JAD .  Unapologetically . 
19	 @ elakdawalla Hehe ,  I assure you ,  we are all champing at the bit to get back to work .  Its been three weeks since I could even check e - mail ! 
19	 @ elakdawalla As a fed PR guy ,  remember ,  as of yesterday ,  we werent even sure wed be working anytime soon !  Give us a day .   :  ) 
19	 @ allysonrobinson  @ duffellduffell No !  but in the mirror universe ,  instead of a goatee ,  I have really long sideburns . 
19	 @ duffellduffell  @ allysonrobinson In my reality ,  there was never a beardless Riker .  EVER . 
19	So ,   @ allysonrobinson ,  this may be of interest to you at the yard sale :  a set of Star Trek commemorative plates !  
19	Alas !  Sold !  RT  @ jaymay :  Todays featured item :  cat slippers !  Also ,  Im probably buying them for my wife .   # ssys 
19	Big Canadian football fan ?  We have the bag for you here at  # SSYS !  
19	Todays featured item :  cat slippers !  Also ,  Im probably buying them for my wife .   # ssys 
19	 @ myramt  # ssys is more fun ! 
19	Allow me to present the best wedding gift !  Ashley and JEB turned it down ,  but it could be yours for 50 cents !   # ssys 
19	Modular daisies ,  anyone ?  
19	I am officially inbound to  # ssys day one !  Ill be live - tweeting a yard sale today ,  so ,  be ready for that .  But it has really weird stuff ! 
19	 @ ajcbraves it was so loud just now you couldnt hear announcers on TBS .  He was screaming about being loud for TBS .  Mission accomplished ? 
19	 @ caitycaity My grandmother ,  who taught me poker ,  has yet to adequately convey the nuances of bingo to me . 
19	 @ Braves Washington ,  DC here !  No Natitude in sight !   # BeatLA
19	This helps .  RT  @ Vol _ Photos :  Upset about the Vols overtime loss ?  Well let this cheer you up .   # futureSmokey 
19	 @ ButMadNNW yeah ,  Im immediately asking whether this outfit also has such little regard for their clients privacy . 
19	 @ ButMadNNW did that actually happen ?  That is terrible . 
19	 @ DisneyHipsters any chance for Narcoossees ?  Post - dinner boat to MK is a beautiful thing . 
19	 @ xeni ITS TIME TO GOVERN ,  JESSE
19	I miss my hometown .  RT  @ chacousa :  Good Morning from beautiful Chattanooga TN !  Chaco is hanging with the team from  @ RockCreek all day . 
19	 @ wesrucker247 I mean ,  they  * did *  see what he can do . 
19	This .  RT  @ wesrucker247 :  Peterman sacked ,  fumbles .  Florida ball inside the Vols 10 .  Still liking this QB change ? 
19	 # TSA security theater is in full effect at Archives stop .  Much  " behavior detection "  voodoo .  So ,  you know ,  walk to Chinatown .  Or Fed Tri . 
19	How cool is  @ BulldogBeing ?  Didnt just give a ball to a kid at the dugout :  he gave him a bat .  Thats why we love him . 
19	 @ xeni Think of all the meth you could have been cooking ! 
19	 @ dorieturner THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT
19	 @ MKPony When we rode it last week ,  it felt  " off ,  "  but as an every - few - years visitor ,  I couldnt put a finger on it . 
19	 @ allysonrobinson I definitely just lold . 
19	My friend is live - tweeting Murder She Wrote .  RT  @ pint _ of _ awesome :  GET OUT OF MRS FLETCHERS WAY SHE WILL KNOCK A B * TCH DOWN !   # murdershewrote
19	 @ ClayTravisBGID too much money spent paying former coaches ? 
19	 @ dorieturner Indeed ! 
19	Taking the best route to Epcot .   # monorailorange 
19	 @ GoTeamMegan At least we can find common ground in the Safaris improvement .  We rode it yesterday and it was like an entirely different trip . 
19	 @ GoTeamMegan and none of the Southerners giving you the evil eye are us .  So ,  generalizations . 
19	 @ GoTeamMegan to be fair ,  the number of looks I see NYers giving anyone with a Southern accent doesnt really help . 
19	 @ abumuqawama Hanging out with the astronaut with whom hes attending the Village People reunion show .  Clearly . 
19	 @ caitycaity glad to see youve learned the West Virginia state motto so quickly ! 
19	 @ ButMadNNW Ugh . Im sorry the quests been so hard .  But it will happen ,  then the next thing and then this will be the past .  Youll get there ! 
19	 @ pint _ of _ awesome nope ,  but  @ MKPony has the most detailed ,  insightful blog about the history  ( and evolution )  of Walt Disney World ever ! 
19	 @ MKPony Thanks !  Shameful / joyful fact :  I will be enjoying my first  ( real )  Citrus Swirl tomorrow . 
19	 @ Lead _ Better I didnt realize Emory was playing tonight ! 
19	Tomorrow I go to Disney World for 1st time since following  @ MKPony  (  & amp ;  1st in 5 years )  I owe thanks for a new perspective on place I love ! 
19	Imagine being 33 !  RT  @ themoderngal :  As a 31 - year - old ,  I feel like I just need to go ahead ,  throw in the towel .  My lifetime has been wasted . 
19	 @ pint _ of _ awesome I love the hanky ,  but the tie ?  Too skinny !  When it comes to actual neckties ,  Im all about the power tie . 
19	Yes !  But the push - up contest is next .  RT  @ pint _ of _ awesome :   " Baby ,  I beat  @ myramt at arm wrestling .  "  Is this true ,   @ jaymay ? 
19	 @ RegalMovies Bummed you wouldnt open extra theatre for  @ Rifftrax at Ballston !  Saw at least 30 ppl trying to buy tix in 5 mins we waited . 
19	RT  @ postmetrogirl :   # Metro Silver Line test train derails 
19	 @ carigervin Newseum ,  amazing !  Go !  Spy Museum ,  meh .  Smithsonian Am .  Art .  / Natl portrait gallery across street is better ,  free . 
19	 @ themoderngal Amen to that .  Glad to know Im not alone in that predicament . 
19	 @ GoTeamMegan remember ,  they only do that if people are actually willing to buy it .   * that *  is the messed up part . 
19	 @ caitycaity Wow . 
19	So happy  @ hulagirltruck is at Gallery Place today !  So delicious .  And no bus ride required to get it ! 
19	 @ NoodlesinCHI I think it sounds pretty normal .  But I think we have the same issue here . 
19	 @ ogliz I did that twice last week .  First night it worked ,  second night :  fail . 
19	 @ PastorAmyDC  @ duffellduffell I dunno ,  Im two weeks in to wearing shorts to church ,  and Im loving every minute of it . 
19	This embarrasses me .  RT  @ acomak :  Braves fans ,  appreciate your passion .  Please stop using derogatory terms 4 women ,  or body parts ,  in replies
19	Only my beard clipper knows for sure .  RT  @ Lead _ Better :   @ Braves I found the doppelgänger to  @ BulldogBeing :   @ jaymay !  
19	This !  RT  @ Braves :  Clown move bro
19	 @ ButMadNNW the second third time is the charm ! 
19	 @ ButMadNNW Hee !  Im good for more than just stories of making a rear end of myself on cruise ships .   :  ) 
19	 @ ButMadNNW Yeah ,  they are now Web only .  Killed apps totally dead . 
19	 @ ButMadNNW Done !  Remember not to feel that surge of quiet confidence any faster than it takes to realize how well - prepared you are .   :  ) 
19	 @ ButMadNNW no !  I have been dealing with death of Tweetdeck and missing bunch of tweets .  Congrats ! 
19	 @ ButMadNNW reading you loud and clear !

19	 @ themoderngal  @ carigervin Same at Nats Park .  Always a line for Shake Shack . 
19	 @ duffellduffell its just people shouting at a replicator ! 
19	Overheard in the elevator :   " the girls got like 250 followers .  You have to respect that skill set .  " 
19	 @ ButMadNNW its cool .  We still love you .   :  ) 
19	 @ dtearl it was a very odd moment when I was no longer an administrator on the  @ UTKnoxville page .  Life as a modern PR guy . 
19	 @ catclo and Nickel Creek is always worth a good binge . 
19	 @ catclo last time I saw him ,  though ,  he was definitely in early stages of creeping out .   :  ) 
19	 @ catclo I was lucky and saw him before he got famous when he would do songwriter night things in Athens ! 
19	 @ catclo wait Im being dumb !  I made that a Nickel Creek song in my head ! 
19	 @ catclo Did you ever see them live ? 
19	 @ dcsportsbog  " I have a most delicious way for you to die ,  Mr .  Bond .  "   -  -  Orangefinger

19	 @ PastorAmyDC Zookeeper . 
19	 @ xeni Weirdly that is exactly what I needed to see right now . 
19	 @ xeni that looks so much like bird shot . 
19	 @ tvoti full disclosure ,  Im sending that from the seats at a Phish concert ,  so .  .  .  I guess I practice what I preach ? 
19	 @ tvoti ultimately ,  its also just okay to like a show critics dont !  I think its easy  ( no offense )  to let that mean more than it does . 
19	Guess this means no Rocky Top !   # stillchasing RT  @ Phish _ FTR Scent Of A Mule
19	I pray for peace above all . 
19	 @ duffellduffell was that ever a real option ? 
19	 @ MKPony and the challenge is that its not being replaced with better things ,  if at all .  Im all for good change . 
19	 @ MrsDeMaria Ebullient ! 
19	 @ MaryBethIkard and when our state is more focused firing teachers than feeding starving kids in our own backyard !  Its painful .
