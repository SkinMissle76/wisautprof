-1	 @ SmoothLynn If smooth had a playlist like solidgoldgem . am I could put up with a jukebox ! 
-1	 @ SmoothLynn If you can try and get back on Radio 2
-1	 @ SmoothLynn Mind you they do have a lot to sort out from the mess Steve Collins made of it under GMGfigures say it all . Music too repetitive
-1	 @ SmoothLynn  very good broadcaster being silenced .  . shame on global
-1	 @ Davebsmooth  @ SmoothRadio Dont you get bored playing same ones every night ?   We have such a big music catalogue too
-1	 @ SmoothLynn Ive listened to you from Capital onwards , you deserve better !  !  !  !

-1	 @ qblockpete sick of these newspapers putting me on edge
-1	 @ knewgrass 
-1	 @ MiSoulTweets thats the better option than paying a small fortune to get on dab at 64k mp2  mono !  !  ! 
-1	 @ MiSoulTweets  imagine mi - soul in this sound with the better music ?   
-1	 @ MiSoulTweets Hope these engineering works are being put in place to finally at last provide a Hi - fi stream ?  .  .  128 aac [ advance audio codec ] 
-1	 @ jlsinc These new buses are certainly best since the routemasters , only the Boris haters dont like them !  !  !  ! 
-1	 @ FreeBBC WVL121 LX03ECY Fulham Broadway 23 : 31 77565 Shoe Lane   & lt ;  & lt ;  & lt ;  They have another WVL on , perhaps beginning of a conversion back ? 
-1	 @ knewgrass 
-1	 @ FreeBBC or someone has come back from holiday or sick leave and not been trained to drive it yet  ? 
-1	 @ FreeBBC they have decided the NB4L is more of an asset on a busier route  ;  ) 
-1	 @ BorisWatch I love Boris .  . leave him alone .  . he gave us the best bus for 30 years
-1	 @ Delveyboy trying to use your sky sports news stream on wiziwig ?  ?  ?   no joy

-1	 @ liamdutton 
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ BorisWatch  @ Helzbels If it was Kens bus they would be creaming themselves dont feed the trolls
-1	 @ jazzfmnow not 5 times a day I dont ,  well seems like that
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ billybusbirkett  @ heritageroutes Great Find .  .  . magic of london changed when these buses got refurbished and then removed
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ daithaic That £354k is fantastic value , London looks brighter for having them
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ SGFMann  @ Helzbels  @ BorisWatch  @ RyanGosling Leon daniels advises public love them , only political websites like this slates NB4L !  !  ! 
-1	 @ daithaic  thats what it is your hatred of bus is political , anything Boris touches or has a hand in you detest , if this had been kens !  !  !  ! 
-1	 @ daithaic  It blows every other bus away on our london roads , worth every penny  & amp ;  its for London nobody else !  !  !  !  ! 
-1	 @ BorisWatch  @ glitterbug72 Its smaller but design is thousand times better but Ken never made it and Boris was responsible for it  !  !  !  !  ! 
-1	 @ BorisWatch  @ TfLOfficial  @ FreeBBC   Oh and you dont troll about your hatred of Boris ?  ?  ?  ? 
-1	 @ BorisWatch  @ TfLOfficial  @ FreeBBC Oh dear Boriswatch .  . if Ken had delivered them he would have needed tissues !  !  !  !  !  ! 
-1	 @ daithaic  I can tell you are a mate of Ken s rolleyes
-1	 @ RosieKendrick 
-1	 @ chrisphilips 
-1	 @ TfLOfficial Boris mentioned this new bus for London , an original routemaster route that is route 7 wont be getting them , Leon daniels source
-1	 @ TfLOfficial that 500 you mention needs to be trebled , lets get rid of these ghastly box buses for good
-1	 @ TfLOfficial rollout so far has been apalling . should have been smoother than it has been so far .  . love the bus though . 24 / 7 crew though please
-1	 @ thisisheart   shame about quality of stream on a broadband desktop pc !  !  !   when will a hi - fi stream be available like radio jackie has ? 
-1	 @ FreeBBC 
-1	 @ FreeBBC 
-1	 @ FreeBBC 
-1	 @ billybusbirkett  @ FreeBBC the rts  otherwise we have been left with garbage for years
-1	 @ FreeBBC 
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ heritageroutes newer seat covers the poor lighting and the original yellow missingfeels like a metro bus with ghastly tube lights
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ heritageroutes I do know that .  . waste of time .  . they are the vandalised ones
-1	 @ FreeBBC we should have one routemaster old on all NB4L routes [ original decor ]  Its then only one bus not wheel chair friendly  ;  ) 
-1	 @ TfLOfficial What route is next after 390 on 7th Dec for nb4l ?  No announcements recently ? 
-1	 @ SmoothRadio Ive chosen my top 3 from your repetition 500 , challenge afterwards is to scrap that 500 for a few weeks and play other tunes !  !  ! 
-1	 @ AcademyQPRUSA You were special to us all
-1	 @ FreeBBC do you think thats good going ?   Bit slow if you ask me , im waiting for news they are so popular a lot more than 608 are being made !  ! 
-1	 @ 5tewartChristie  @ FreeBBC well its better than the box buses that have been a sore on the eye of Londoners since removal of routemasters
-1	 @ FreeBBC any new bus new for nb4l ?  I eagerly await the next 1000 tba
-1	 @ Chris _ Gilvear hope you play jazz tonight and not bubble gum pop Mark walker is constantly feeding you
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ MayorWatch  I hope they triple that and buy more of these wonderful vehicles
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ a729  NB4L is fantastic revival of old rear buses , fare evasion will be minimal once established they cant get away from inspectors
-1	 @ FreeBBC Yeah always had a pack of paynes chocolate raisins  [ poppets ] 
-1	 @ chrisphilips follow me I want to talk via direct message
-1	 @ TfLOfficial yet you can only issue 608 new ones in favour of producing box buses too that deprived us of the routemaster in 1st place
-1	 @ UKPowerNetworks two direct messages sent 12 mins ago
-1	 @ UKPowerNetworks thats weird .  . how long does a direct twitter message take with my phone number .  . dont want everyone to know it or i wouldhere
-1	 @ UKPowerNetworks  i have now sent you a direct message
-1	 @ UKPowerNetworks  Yes there is but its a bit public here , was given a number 0800 0280274 but constantly engaged

-1	 @ patsharp  @ SmoothRadio same tunes day in day out .  .  . yawn
-1	 @ LDNTBB1  @ DW41Tom Also if that is the case a bit silly having nb4l on display if never any intention to have bus serve westfield , white city
-1	 @ DW41Tom well the 148 is getting them and it goes to white city
-1	 @ DW41Tom  @ LDNTBB1 Im all for extending routes back to near how they were with original routemasters with crew  & amp ;  two extra entrances aswell
-1	 @ DW41Tom 94 should be scrapped 49 extended to acton green and 12 extended to westfield shepherds bush with nb4l
-1	 @ LDNTBB1  @ DW41Tom thanks for news .  .  . 8 deserves nb4l through brick lane .  . nice route and routemasters too , now to get it extended back to wille
-1	 @ LDNTBB1 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 22 , 25 , 53 , 30 , 74 , 88 , 139 ,  these routes would be next for nb4l if down to me  ;  )

-1	 @ FreeBBC rollout of these buses is very slow .  . route conversion every two months
-1	 @ Chris _ Gilvear Sounding good  & amp ;  nice  & amp ;  live .  . How about Jeremy Wall feat Vanesse Thomas Fly Away
-1	 @ FreeBBC  @ mr _ edward _ b  clueless Ive been on that 148 bus many a time when a conductor would not have had me stuck and late with extra cost
-1	 @ knewgrass Sorry to read shocking Paris news , lowest of the low is theft

-1	 @ BorisWatch NB4L .  . more of them tomorrow .  . another miserable day for you ha ! ha !

-1	 @ NicolaBonn There are a lot of concerned smooth radio listeners at the way Global have chosen to be a clone of Gold 4 songs and a sentence ! 
-1	 @ NicolaBonn Have global taken you off heart for good ?  Seems you have to be known on TV for that gig !  !  !  ! 
-1	 @ NicolaBonn  Im feeling too tired to wait up .  . Missed your debut but tuned to smooth overnight  & amp ;  Paul hollins dont say much .  .
