40	 @ Crackerwax XFactor ,  XFactor ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

40	Has there been a Risk Assessment done on real grown ups helping to clean up the streets  -  or is that not  " important "  now ? 
40	Get real Theresa May ,  your  " softly ,  softly "  approach WILL NOT work .  We pay for police and expect them to be able to do their job UNHINDERED !

40	 @ pecagalore Yes !  Sod everything people cannot live like that  -  get the hell outta there ! 
40	 @ Crackerwax Fajitas  -  but dont go down Hackney for your ingredients !
