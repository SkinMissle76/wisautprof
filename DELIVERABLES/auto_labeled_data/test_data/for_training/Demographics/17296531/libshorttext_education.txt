2	 @ popey Not jumping to a conclusion ,  I did say it could be an error .  Freenode is up ,  I used Google DNS instead of Virgin provided to check  :  ) 
2	 @ virginmedia So is your traffic management via deep packet inspection or just on the amount of data being tx / rx by an IP ? 
2	 @ jon _ atkinson are you OK ?  Blink once for yes or twice to tell me to fuck off  ;  ) 
2	 @ ben _ nuttall  @ phpcodemonkey  @ jontheniceguy  @ robiebasak  @ samheadleand  @ elsie _ m _  Thanks Ben ,  nice write up .  You did a lot of good work in 2013
2	 @ ntoll  @ virginmedia I changed my DNS to Google and I can reach Freenode ok .  Virgin has had routing issues in past few weeks . 
2	Hi  @ virginmedia Im trying to upload 10gb of video to YouTube but my connection keeps timing out .  Are there upload restrictions ?  Thx
2	 @ fortyfourMu ha thanks for the heads up

2	 @ Sam _ 152  @ p0welly try using Google DNS  ( 8 . 8 . 8 . 8  & amp ;  8 . 8 . 4 . 4 )  .  I dont think it has been blocked ,  merely  @ virginmedia DNS is having issues . 
2	 @ isDavidNelson  @ TommyBobbins PiFace C & amp ; D is a great board and well suited to this task . I made a streamer radio in July , v messy without PiFace
2	 @ ben _ nuttall  @ cymplecy yeah he is ,  lovely guy . 
2	 @ MethodDan  " I hope Satan brings you something made of rice ?  "
