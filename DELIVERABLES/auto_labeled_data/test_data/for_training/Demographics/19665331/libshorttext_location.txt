17	Or .  .  .  an electric WKD blue livery .  With  " Hi Sue !  "  italicised on the spoiler . 
17	With the BMW i8 making use of Gorilla Glass and the Porsche 918 running HTML5 infotainment ,  will cars of the future just be smartphones ?

17	The love for Hachi - Roku over here is insane .  Who thinks  @ OllieMarriage should wrap his  @ topgeargarage BRZ like this ?  
17	I had a chat with the guys at Forza to see how they replicate cars in games .  The detail they go into is amazing .  
17	From the reaction of the Petri dish on wheels  ( a bus )  Im on ,  even though Bugatti are losing money on each Veyron ,  the PR was worth it . 
17	I was lucky enough to photograph some absolute legends  ( both people and cars )  earlier this week 
17	 @ jimbo2728 A 1974 BMW 2002 Turbo would have top bunk and a black 991 GT3 would be on the bottom .  Doubt a Rangie would fit in the garage

17	Just turned on the  # F1 .  Did I see a Ferrari 348 safety car at the back of the pack or am I going COMPLETELY MENTAL ?

17	Im on uncle duty today .  Teaching the kids lifes essential skills .  Yknow ,  things like drifting .  .  .  
17	The spare wheel was a bit odd though .  Has the power to rattle digestive leftovers free from your intestines .  
17	My only beef is that the pass footwell light is stupidly bright and always on .  But easily fixed by kicking it really hard / pulling the fuse
17	I saw the 208 T16 being built ,  went to Pikes Peak with it and thanks to  @ krismeeke ,  we finally got behind the wheel 
17	Spent a day with the Ferrari 458 Speciale last week .  It is off the chain .  
17	 @ atheeb412 Hi .  What shot were you looking at ? 
17	Couldnt get over the size of it ,  especially the rear wheels .  Look at it compared to an Atom .  .  .  
17	Its also a shame that its redundant of any feedback .  But does sounds ace with the sports zorst and the ride isnt that bad for a big Audi
