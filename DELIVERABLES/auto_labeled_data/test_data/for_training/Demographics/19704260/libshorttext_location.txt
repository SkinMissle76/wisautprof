46	 @ howiegoldfarb Were just in the process of defining a global strategy  -  there is 0 %  focus on advertising ;  100 %  focus on relations .

46	If using dashboards to schedule up tweets for the New Year ,  double - check the settings to avoid premature shout - outs !   # CMGR
46	 @ Plantronics _ UK Do you guys have any cases for your headsets ?  Got a Blackwire C220 - M ,  but looking for a storage / travel pouch / case . 
46	 @ KHassallhoff  @ rchel _ b Secret Escapes have some proper good offers on at the moment :  
46	 @ ewenl91 The buildings got no TV signal ,  bud .  Is this something you boys deal with ? Ive got no Sky ,  no freeview on any TVs . 
46	New Year ,  new office .  
46	 @ PostOffice Ive crawled your sent tweets since January 3rd ,  and you havent .  This is your first interaction .  Im now following you .

46	 @ SkyHelpTeam It says free for existing customers .  How do I get myself one ?  
46	 @ houseoffraser Cheers ,  Ricky ! 
46	 @ NL _ Andrew Its only a short - term contract ,  so having weighed up all options ,  this seems best for my situation .  Did consider it though . 
46	 @ SkyHelpTeam Thanks .  Ive just done so .  It linked me to track my order ,  but it doesnt list anything there .  .  . 
46	 @ xxLauraEastonxx It seems everyone in Swindon has gone coffee - mad this winter !  Maybe its the cups .  .  . 
46	Where does a really good burger not too far from  # Swindon ?  Im looking in your direction ,   @ davidpll _   & amp ;   @ eishamonikh  -  happy with recs . 
46	 @ shaunsuju This :

46	 @ FGW Thats a pain .  It said  " delivery is guaranteed by 13 . 00hrs the next working day "  .  Today IS the next working day though ,  no ?  Â£6 spunked . 
46	 @ FGW Thanks Eli .

46	 @ mtthrdy Yet to use them myself ,  but give them a go ,  and let me know if you get stuck . 
46	 @ JordanOnSocial I used it more on a personal basis ,  rather than brand - related . 
46	 @ andrew _ FLICW Are you just replicated Morsheads tweets ?  ! 
46	 @ PostOffice Any chance of a reply ?  
46	 @ dwdowning619 Companies like Lithium do a great Community Management Certification .  .  .  probably worth a look - in for this year . 
46	 @ benharper87 My pleasure ,  Ben
46	 @ andrew _ FLICW Oh right . They just all look a little similar .  Originality and authenticity is key to a successful Twitter campaign .

46	 @ dwdowning619 No worries .  There are probably some US - based organisations offering social certifications too ,  but I dont know personally
46	 @ 101Tarrant Did it last year .  Its not actually that tough .  It made me quit smoking too ! 
46	 @ PeopleofSwindon Do more to make the town centre a more appealing place .  Â£ shops ,  bookies ,  and merry - go - rounds are why we go elsewhere . 
46	 @ SkyHelpTeam They didnt help yesterday .  As I said ,  I think its an issue with the building ,  not just my Sky .  . 
46	 @ TinoLedge The Chase .  .  thank me later .

46	 @ WSPNews Hootsuite is a really useful social media dashboard ,  and can allow you to manage and organise your experience far more effectively . 
46	 @ waz _ 19 Yet ,  were still struggling with 3G across most of the town . 
46	 @ ESquareHotel Thanks for the follow .  Hope all is well !

46	 @ O2 My tweet was referring to EE .  I left them and came to you ,  because their 3G signal was poor around here . 
46	 @ SkyHelpTeam Was TV .  But I think its the area .  As another TV isnt working in the house too .  Ill keep you posted . 
46	Adebayors 3 / 1 :  anytime scorer .

46	 @ z _ frostie95 Whys that ?  I go all the time ! 
46	My afternoons sponsored by Earth ,  Wind  & amp ;  Fire .  Requests welcome . 
46	 @  _ meaghanmarie _  Probably because theyre made by the same company .  .  . 
46	 @ TomGlass15 Its quite an achievement . 
46	 @ kmurds1 And Im sure 2014 will follow a similar blueprint ! 
46	 @ SkyHelpTeam Have had no signal all day .  Followed the online guide ;  nothing sorted .  What do we do ?

46	 @ kingcam94 One for your wank bank ?  
46	 @ MichaelDzik The focus on relationships should be key to all .  Thats the heart to any community ,  and should be to any campaign . 
46	 @ KaggzLouise You could ask this for most organic consumer goods on this earth .  So why single out the trees ?

46	Quick Christmas message from the Mandela Signer :  
46	 @ SM _ Marketing _  By setting goals and targets over time / campaigns ,  and monitoring the achievements .  Plenty of other tactics ,  but this  =  simple
46	If you need an app to remind you of your highlights from 2013 ,  then it cant really have been such a  " year to remember "  ,  no ? 
46	 @ eishamonikh Ideally ,  outside of Swindon .  And either or !  A lot are saying 5 Guys in Reading .  .  .  you tried Atomic Burger in Oxford ? 
46	 @ ZakEdelman My pleasure ! 
46	 @ NattBright Best value for money is probably Next Generation . 
46	 @ willpscott Amazes me that big brands ,  with big budgets ,  cut corners .  They should have enough in - house experience to be nailing channels . 
46	 @ toon _ teddy 3 . 
46	 @ JasonSchemmel  @ myCMGR Get some professional experience under your belt .  Join an agency ,  or get an internship .  You cant beat it !   # CMGR

46	 @ Storytegic A pleasure ! 
46	 @ JipJipperson  @ MichaelYates82  @ O2  @ CPWTweets Its only on EE at the moment ,  bud .  This towns still struggling with 3G ,  so 4G seems pointless

46	 @ JordanOnSocial And heres a recipe for that :

46	 @ O2 Do you do the Google Nexus 7 as part of a contract package with my existing plan ? 
46	 @ rubytrubes We have Creme Eggs here in Swindon now too .  Probably the best thing to happen to Swindon in a while ,  mind .  So I shouldnt moan . 
46	 @ dempsey4labour Id love to think that would be the case ,  but Im just not convinced . 
46	 @ swindon _ weather Looks like  @ wiltsweather has some competition .  .  . 
46	 @ JipJipperson Cheers ,  you too !  Who knows ?  !  Theres plenty out there ,  but pretty content with whats on the BP project table at the moment .  . 
46	 @ SkyHelpTeam Its a Sky + HD .  Im not sure what other info I can give .  Would there be a speific model listed anywhere ? 
46	 @ mtthrdy Maybe one of these guys can help .  .  .  Latergram . me still going ?   @ imackinn  @ symana  @ cindychenc  @ roger _ patterson  @ belfordz

46	 @ z _ frostie95 Not a fan of their seats ,  or the fact you have to choose where you sit before heading in .  All just preferences ,  I guess .
