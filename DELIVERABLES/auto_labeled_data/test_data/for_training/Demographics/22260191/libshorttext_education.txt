2	 @ Razorlight Before I Fall to Pieces
2	London Town Rocks ! 
2	Back in civilisation .  Never attempting that drive on a Friday afternoon again :  Manic !  Although ,  better than being at a bus stop with Chavs . 
2	Packing .  Sensible shoes .  Not Heat .  Although .  .  .  Essex .  .  .  you never know .  .  . 
2	Packing
2	I bought a Garmin .  Still not looking forward to the move North . 
2	Moving to Essex for 2months is not as bad as Afghanistan for 6months .  All about perspective .  Thoughts are with the 3Rifles as they deploy . 
2	Decided .  Essex it is .  Ik . 
2	God ,  is it only Tuesday ?  Need the weekend .  Although weekend means decisions .  Cant bloody win .  Could it at least stop raining ? 
2	bleh
2	Rain .  Ik .  Glad to be home now at least . 
2	Back to the grind .  And soon to be unemployed .  Good week ? 
2	I want Arctic Monkey tickets for my birthday .  Buymeee ! 
2	Looking forward to a Saturday night in ,  watching Strictly . 
2	TGIF .  Oh ,  its not ?  Is for me ,  suckers . 
2	Skint til Friday .  Crisis .

2	Loving listening to TUKS fm live online .  Rock the SA choons ! 
2	I survived Monday !  Yay !  If only I would get paid ,  like would be sweet .

2	Admin mostly done .  Is it weekend yet ? 
2	Day off !  Yay ! 
2	Had lunch in a quiet ,  sunny ,  beautiful little green oasis in the middle of London .  Love this job . 
2	Jealous of all those in SA having a looong weekend .  Long weekend will have to suffice .  Its Friday ! 
2	The girl in the supermarket checkout in front of me was buying sanitary pads and cream cakes .  Think every girl can relate . 
2	First day of work completed .  Pretty successfully I think . 
2	Not looking forward to the early start tomorrow .  I guess thats what real grown - ups and responsible adults do . 
2	Last day of being a drain on resources .  Its been great .  Bring on the positive contribution to society and that salary cheque ! 
2	Finally moving into my own room .  Good riddance sofa bed ! 
2	The wine was so worth it .  One glass was enough . 
2	Hope the wine is worth the travelling and the high possibility of getting lost . 
2	Its saturday .  hmm .  Stay home alone or go out with pretentious people ?  At least there will be vodka . 
2	Friday night lonely .  A special kind of lonely . 
2	Decisions !  Oh no !  I didnt realise being all growed up meant deciding things ! 
2	Job ! 
2	If this is a rom com ,  kill the director
2	RIP Patrick Swayze ,  Keith Floyd and the Humpback Whale in the Thames
2	RIP Patrick Swayze
2	I dont wanna be all growed up .  Cant I just play ? 
2	One step closer to being a grown up . 
2	Today was going to be a  " being a grown up "  day .  .  .  Dont think getting out of bed at 11 sets the tone
2	Wondering what the week will bring . 
2	Sunday night
2	Excellent F1 .  The weather looked beautiful in Italy .  I should be there . 
2	Grand Prix !  !  The weather is crap ,  was going to stay inside all day anyway ! 
2	Fragile ,  but not broken .  Leaving Camden for the Grand and 3night busses home .  Living the dream ,  baby .  Living the dream . 
2	As predicted ,  I fell over alot .  Ow .

2	 " If this is a rom com ,  Kill the director " 
2	Procrastination
2	Sunshine in England !  Glorious ! 
2	Why is everyone online ?  Ambushed ,  and distracted .  I dont have time ,  or enough co - ordination to chat to everyone ! 
2	Today might be the day to bring order to the chaos .  Probably not ,  though . 
2	Idle
2	Hangover .  Bleh . 
2	It seems as though a sparkling personality might just be enough
