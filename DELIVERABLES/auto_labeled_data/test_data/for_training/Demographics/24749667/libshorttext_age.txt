-0.34	 # NBABallot Stephen Curry
-0.34	Still dont like these ‚Äú @ NetsDaily :  Get ready for the Christmas jersey .  
-0.34	As if being down 66 - 42 wasnt bad enough ,  Paul Pierce got himself ejected with a flagrant foul 2 on George Hill : 
-0.34	 @ AdamFaz81 Or just to wind up Knicks fans .  Or because Mikhail Prokhorov has more money than sense .  Pick any daft reason you like . 
-0.34	 @ AdamFaz81 theres a fair chance .  I think one of the key players ,  Williams or Lopez ,  will be traded by Feb .  They need to make a statement
