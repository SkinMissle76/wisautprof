3	Considering my angry face en route to work this morning ,  today’s not working out too shabby 😊
3	Here’s a random thing .  Got a  # groupon voucher ,  2 nights in  # liverpool ,  plus one dinner and one breakfast  # forsale .  Cost £110 .  Any offers ? 
3	Confession :  I am marginally obsessed with Danny Dyer .   I can’t help skipping into the accent… .  😍  # eastenders
3	Lookin forward to a lovely day hangin’ with Pappa Coops for some DIY action .  I think the DIY canvases his desire to pop round for a gossip . 
3	Aaaah ,  Monday Club with the family tonight .  Deeliiish dinner and gossips .  Minus Christmas decs though ,  badtimes !  😞
3	8am start tomorrow as we cruise up to  # halifax for  # worktimes .  Does that classify as proper ‘in the north ? ’ Prepping accent in anticipation . 
3	Coming home after a  few wines ,  faced with the duty of finishing writing a feature is either a stroke of genius or absolute disaster… . 
3	So ,  was there like mega rain and wind last night or did I just imagine it ?  Utterly crap nights sleep  :  ( 
3	These have taken me a little by surprise today .  Whoever thought of filling pretzels with pillows of… 
3	First Christmas dinner of the year conquered .  All in the name of restaurant reviewing ,  you… 
3	Here for work early today and there’s actually no one here yet .  Wish there was a costa nearby…  # mkworktimes  # toomanyroundabouts
3	So twitter helpers ,  is anyone au fait with the use of umbrella companies ?  I am confused… .   # tax  # income
3	Magazine is done !   * actions lap of victory round the office *  👍
3	Phew !  My  # berkhamsted faves  # rumbles have made me last day utterly delightful with their redeemed fish… 
3	 @ SamDiss randomly came across this ,  but currently am editor of trade mag and freelance restaurant reviewer .  Would love to find out more  :  ) 
3	 @ HannahPeddar I used to work for a trade magazine called Tableware International .  Was too swish and not pun filled ,  wouldn’t have worked ! 
3	 # 2  # day2  # 365  # project365 back to work today after two delightful weeks off .  Straight back in the… 
3	Has anyone ever used one of these ?  I felt like a right smart arse 😎  # amazonlocker  # xmas  # shopping… 
3	 @ missacbrooks thank you !  By lunchtime on Friday ,  I will be hitting the Christmas spirit ,  hard !   # minesalargeone 🍸
3	What a gorgeous sunny day today !  ☺️
3	The entire population of  # dunstable ,  including some very scrummy men ,  made it to  @ CostaCoffee this morning .  Where have you all been hiding ?  ! 
3	Just seen an email entitled ‘Walking in a onesie wonderland’ .  Genuinely gutted I didn’t come up with that one…
3	Theres a girl sitting here as Im about to have dinner sitting here in flip flops .  In actual November .  As sparkly as they are ,  I’m outraged . 
3	Feeling surprisingly un - festive this year ,  that was until  @ BBCRadio2 rocked out ‘Last Christmas’ this morning ,  my fave festive choon ! 
3	Super indulgent afternoon bath .  Lush bath bomb ,  candles ,  and some magic fm choonage .  I am not… 
3	 @ catgill nope ,  just working here under a freelance contract so have to handle my own tax shindigs .   :  ( 
3	 @ Mandmegmc I actually love this ! 
3	I have decided I very much need to go to Lapland .  Are children and  /  or smug happy other half a absolute requirement ? 
3	I LOVE a little bit of MK twinkle at Christmas !   # shopping  # exciting  @  thecentre : mk 
3	Weekend has gone too damn fast .  I have naff all too contribute to those ‘how was your weekend’ convos that will happen at 9am  :  ( 
3	I have today located the nearest  @ CostaCoffee for  # mkworktimes .  Peace is restored . 
3	Catching up on  @ chattyman .  Have come to the conclusion I just don’t ‘get’ the Robin Thicke hype .  At all . 
3	 @ adrianwalker78 spoken like a true gentleman !  Haha  :  ) 
3	First night with new Christmas tree plus cat at chez coops .  I wonder how long it will last…  # mischeviouskitten 😼
3	Lovely leaving card .  Totally the plan for Monday 😎  # newjob  # leaving  # card 
3	Just had to enlist a neighbours help to evict a humongous spider from my flat .  Proof alone I am totally not a grown up yet . 
3	Man .  I am never going to look at a uniform the same way again .  I thought plates was hectic ,  but this ,  is technical .  .   # newjob
3	Saw a sign for ‘Ice rink and magical Santas’s grotto’ en route to work this morning .  Very nearly diverted ,  that sounds AWESOME . 
3	My cat had been living here for nine months and still every morning ,  likes to purr and jump around on me until I wake up .  Cute habit 😽
3	Getting increasingly nervous for my first day tomorrow .  Exciting ,  but very scary !   # newjob  # freshstart
3	So I cycled to  @ ww _ uk this morning in a desperate attempt to offset the cake and yummies I ate this week .  Fail ,  1lb on . 
3	Restaurant reviewing tonight with Pappa Coops .  A nice little way to say thank you for his DIY efforts these past few weeks  :  ) 
3	 @ CostaCoffee haha !  I was bowled over regardless ,  I’m sure your arrival would have been icing on the cake !  ☺️
3	Tonight I am hanging out with one of my girls .  Sad fact is ,  she’s educating me in taxes and doing my own accounts .  I am not vorderman .   # eek
3	Despite having a massive change in routine this week ,   - 2lb off on  @ ww _ uk .  Plus I cycled here again .  Smugface .  😎
3	 @ TinyTina2709 thank you Wrighty ,  we shall celebrate by chinking a latte glass next week !  Xx

3	Happiness comes today in the form of these little fellas .  Yummy scrummy in my tummy .   # percypigs… 
3	A cheeky little treat from my beauty lady today .  My fave place for pampertimes ,  ever ! … 
3	Any other day of my life I am being nagged to go to the gym .  Today ,  ironically ,  I am doing the nagging .  Let’s do this !   # gymtweet  @ PureGym
3	This week has whizzed fast .  Beyond whizzed ,  actually .  Genuinely am bemused it’s the weekend already ! 
3	People who park outside your flat and have a loud as you like phone call thorough their car speaker system .  Seriously ?  ! 
3	I’ve seen at least three people eating before they pay round the supermarket this morning .  Since when was this acceptable ? 
3	 @ missacbrooks but it’s genuine frozen water ?  !  I’m so confused !  Ice cube trays at my gaffe at the one !

3	 @ christofflennon hey dude ,  have you had any reviews come through yet for the food  & amp ;  drink guide ?   :  ) 
3	Given my last tweet ,  am also very thankful to my  @ NUJofficial membership .  Helpful people to a flapping jouno type ☺️
3	Mumma and Pappa Coops are there .  The near impossible chance we’ll spot them is the only reason I’m humouring this  # EnglandvChile
3	My absolutely woeful Saturday night in .  Caning the oranges and h20 like theres no tomorrow .  I hate , … 
3	Snot filled Saturday .  I  am feeling most annoyed .   # selfpitypoorlytweet
