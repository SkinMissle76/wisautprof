-1	 @ parthaskar  @ DavidGilbert43  @ CRoseveare Yes ,  that is certainly true Partha ,  but rarely acknowledged
-1	 @ RonBont I don’t know the answer  -  will find out . 
-1	 @ aaronashmore8 Well good luck with it  -  it is crucial that we impact on the current attendance patterns
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ nhsconfed  @ heartofengland Will name when agreed and have their permission David  -  this week
-1	I recommend this really excellent blog by  @ sean9n  -  thanks for sharing !   @ CRoseveare  @ parthaskar  @ Trisha _ the _ doc  @ philaberry  @ silv24
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ HSCchangeday  @ AnnMarieRiley10 I will support 5 clin teams on pt exp projects ,  if 300 staff support  # hellomynameis
-1	Looking fwd to our first  @ wmahsn Birmingham ,  Solihull  & amp ;  Black Country locality event tomorrow .  Come and help shape the future !   # wmahsnevents
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann is v late Jenny I enjoyed our debate ,  thank you ! 
-1	 @ Clifford49 Have asked Director to intervene Richard  -  is selfish behaviour I quite agree
-1	 @ RonBont Re Hawthorn reserved spaces  -  nobody knows !  Gen Mgr back tomorrow will follow up and find out somehow
-1	 @ RonBont Not sure thats fair .  There are lots of spaces now and only very short walk for those off main site ? 
-1	 @ MatSilk  @ rogerkline Yes but we have to create right narrative for media
-1	A week in the life of an  # NHS CEO 
-1	 @ nhsconfed  @ JonNHSNorwich Thank you ! 
-1	 @ MatSilk  @ rogerkline  @ heartofengland I see Comms as particularly important for CEO  -  messaging inside  & amp ;  outside organisation is crucial
-1	 @ CRoseveare  @ EDdocUK We have extra open now  -  ours and CCG - provided .  Key is to get flow through that ,  so we can continue to access
-1	 @ RonBont Managers have no control over car parking I can assure you .  I cant get into Ed Centre car park ! 
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ gemmarosa I can vouch for that  -  Steven has shown what precociousness can achieve in NI  -  he is a force  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ EDdocUK  @ heartofengland  @ CRoseveare LOL Matthew  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ KayFSheldon  @ drp _ stephens  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Jarmann GMC Duties of a Doctor apply equally to drs in mgt and are enforced
-1	 @ HPIAndyCowper  @ brucejgray  @ jappleby123  @ EDdocUK Will do ! 
-1	 @ EastCoastAdam Hi ,  yes I get to all home games .  Going well at moment long may it last ! 
-1	 @ HSJEditor  @ johngwicks Yes I was called .  Will post something on  @ BenClovers article when i get a moment
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ drkimholt  @ Privateallergy  @ heartofengland Sure .  Will take time to gain trust and change the culture that is ingrained
-1	 @ AnnMarieRiley10  @ wwwframeworks4c Great news Ann - Marie ,  let me know if I can support
-1	“ @ mellojonny :   @ DrWinTadd  @ Jarmann  @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble I think work culture matters more 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann I dont know truth only whats been reported .  Dont criticise anyone  -  mgr or front line without knowing
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ gemmarosa There is ,  and more interest than before is my impression
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ DrGrumble  @ Privateallergy  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann I do not doubt that David ! 
-1	 @ BenP1972  @ OfficialFOXES  @ swfc It was a pleasure Ben .  Merry Christmas  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ HPIAndyCowper  @ HSJEditor  @ johngwicks  @ BenClover Apologies Andy  -  perfect storm of winter ,  Kennedy rpt and Ch Insp visit keeping me busy ! 
-1	 @ Damian _ Roland  @ Leic _ hospital Yes we must continue with learning set Damian .  Have some med students interested too  ( see next tweet ) 
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ drkimholt  @ Privateallergy  @ heartofengland True .  Kennedy review a good start I think  -  we chose to commission it  & amp ;  make public
-1	 @ JakeMat91 It’s a pleasure ,  and Mark ,  please !  It is an impressive summary I must say .   @ Damian _ Roland  & amp ;  I will be in touch re learning set
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann But many resign , frequently .  Has it helped ? 
-1	 @ RonBont Ed Centre open to staff 1st come  ! st served when no event on .  May be spaces if event late in day .  They try to be fair
-1	 @ gremlin2c Good idea ,  is very worthwhile  -  best of luck with it ! 
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ gemmarosa Bit of a self - fulfilling prophecy because change will partly depend on the next generation pushing for it
-1	 @ NurseEiri  @ gremlin2c  @ nhsejlew Yes .  I see it as a professional practice issue and not one that is just for ‘management’ or ‘the Trust
-1	 @ Jarmann  @ Privateallergy  @ KayFSheldon  @ drp _ stephens  @ NHSwhistleblowr I agree .  Top down culture responsible for much of what happens locally
-1	 @ sally _ bobs  @ gremlin2c Good idea .  Needs joint approach  -  clinicians to adopt and promote ,  but IT to show what is possible
-1	 @ JonNHSNorwich  @ RichardatKF In theory it should work ,  so hopes are high ! 
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr IK view was that patient interest means do not give up .  Challenging I agree
-1	My CEO Diary is out 
-1	 @ JonNHSNorwich Many thanks Jon .  Enjoyed your blog this week and have a great and well earned Xmas break ! 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ Jarmann  @ DrGrumble Not convinced .  Maybe better to call for common ethical code across service ? 
-1	 @ drbobmorley  @ HSJnews Yep that must be it Bob ! 
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ gemmarosa The tipping point between generations will come  -  you just need to be ready ! 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Actions taken are good evidence of different approach of current Board
-1	 @ harrylongman  @ wmahsn Those particular quotes on change make sense Harry ? 
-1	 @ DrDKilroy  @ profchrisham  @ HSJEditor Not sure  -  achieving for patients is surely the ultimate aim of regulation ! 
-1	 @ gremlin2c True .  We get it at ward  /  team level  -  trick is to get it wider across a large organisation
-1	 @ RonBont Providing space for those who move eld mean empty spaces ,  which annoy people ?  Also ,  10 . 30 car park works well for many ? 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann Regulation been shown to be ineffective in raising standards thus far ,  so not enthusiastic about more ? 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann Absolutely ,  and he has resigned .  Why did he feel need to put this pressure on staff ? 
-1	 @ profchrisham Thanks Chris ,  good to hear as the pressure on staff  @ heartofengland is high at moment ! 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann but it needs to happen cos it is the solution .  Need to work out how
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ heartofengland  @ HSJnews  @ HSCchangeday Good to hear .  Im involved via  @ AnnMarieRiley10 at Good Hope Hosp  -  have pledge ! 
-1	 @ Thornton _ health  @ HSJnews Indeed  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ Privateallergy  @ KayFSheldon  @ drp _ stephens  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Jarmann Not tough if one is trying to do right things anyway ? 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann Not against mgr regulation ,  just feel addressing top down culture would be more effective
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Most mgrs good people trying to do right .  Ask what is driving them
-1	 @ gemmarosa  @ DrStevenKinnear Great !  Do get support  -  mentoring etc is really helpful .  Us oldies find mentoring next gen a privilege
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Maybe but I see GMC accountability as a strength ,  not a constraint
-1	 @ djnicholl Thanks David ,  sorry didnt get to meet
-1	 @ parthaskar Thanks Partha .  My new year resolution  -  to arrange that meet with you ! 
-1	 @ RonBont Have asked the Clin Dir to brief me asap .  Hope the multi - storey is helping ? 
-1	 @ EastCoastAdam Used to be in corner but couldn’t see one end of pitch !  No idea who others are  -  just know they are  # foxesfaithful  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ pps1fan Thank you very much ,  I saw you there .  We are committed to making the changes and will report back in 6 months . 
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Jeremy _ Twunt Possibly  -  can’t remember they all blur after a while  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ JonNHSNorwich  @ RichardatKF Just read your excellent blog Jonathon  -  Richard is right the two go well together ! 
-1	 @ djnicholl Ah yes !  Not convinced appraisal is always seen as opportunity  -  more often it is seen as a chore I suspect ? 
-1	 @ gemmarosa  @ DrStevenKinnear Encourage and support the next generation of leaders ? 
-1	 @ gremlin2c It is ,  absolutely .  Heartening to see too ,  the teamwork is what makes me optimistic we can maintain it
-1	 @ dermotor Hi Dermot  -  it is straightforward stuff but has proved effective this week .  Happy to share if you wish ,  of course
-1	 @ HealthRound  @ nhsconfed  @ parthaskar  @ Chestcracker  @ DrStevenKinnear Great health blog round up this week Em  -  thanks ! 
-1	 @ RonBont Would you be prepared to meet with John Sellars and myself to discuss ways of improving ? 
-1	 @ RonBont They are trying to manage flow  -  a free for all would lead to chaos .  Will keep under close monitoring and refine as appropriate
-1	 @ DrDKilroy  @ harrylongman Was a good discussion I got a sense that clin leader role is a hot topic with docs at moment ? 
-1	 @ DrDKilroy  @ harrylongman Links between ops difficulties and clin outcomes are increasing issue ?  Not traditional area docs involved in
-1	 @ CRoseveare  @ EDdocUK Fair point but we are determined !  Community capacity is key  -  they need flow too ,  or our discharges will drop
-1	 @ drkimholt Thanks Kim  -  yes a really important one .  Will not be easy to change ,  but we must
-1	 @ EDdocUK  @ CRoseveare Quite .  This weekend is looking good  -  I believe the staff want to maintain it so i am optimistic
-1	 @ EastCoastAdam I did ,  tho worried it would be called off .  West stand this season
-1	 @ rogerkline Agree .  Openness creates ‘noise’ though ,  and noise is not always received well ! 
-1	Great blog from next generation medical leader  @ JakeMat91 of  @ UoBMedLeaders 
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann Yes  -  we agree what is wrong ,  just not on solution . 
-1	 @ Damian _ Roland Hi Damian ,  yes maintaining is now the challenge
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Current HEFT Board sought ext review and published it
-1	 @ belgroi Hi Iona .  Happy New Year  -  hope you had a good one ! 
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr Too soon for proper stats David  -  change not significant as yet .  Sustaining is next challenge ! 
-1	 @ medtechidea  @ HDShowUK Hi Jag sorry didnt get to talk today .  Good discussion at afternoon session ? 
-1	 @ Jarmann  @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble It is culture / ethics at top / centre that is key .  Change this and local management behaviours will change
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann But most hospital managers are registered doctors or nurses
-1	 @ TriciaHart26 Thank you Tricia ,  you too .  Best wishes
-1	 @ wwwframeworks4c I hadn’t heard of them Andy ,  but yes ,  they do .  With the right people I can see they would be powerful
-1	 @ rogerkline Thank you .  Openness the right approach ,  but often an uncomfortable one for leaders
-1	 @ Clifford49  @ heartofengland I was sorry too Richard  -  news tomorrow will show reason why .  My apologies
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann We have sent Kennedy Review to GMC  -  they will take a view
-1	 @ RonBont  @ Ed If we fill multi - storey first this wont be a problem .  And first in often first out so best in YG multi - storey ? 
-1	My CEO Diary is out  -  our Perfect Week initiative and the Kennedy Breast Care Review 
-1	 @ wwwframeworks4c Thanks Andy ,  very kind
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Kennedy actions all accepted ,  Review reported to GMC
-1	 @ RonBont By the way ,  I think the two mgt parking spaces were reserved to allow window cleaners access  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ fentonaw A great start ,  and lots learned .  Now we need to establish as routine practice .  Community capacity is key so they need flow too
-1	 @ RonBont Will check the process with Est Dir in a minute
-1	 @ gemmarosa  @ DrStevenKinnear  @ NHSLeadership Excellent .  Let me know if I can help in any way
-1	 @ MatSilk  @ rogerkline Not unpopular with me  -  I have an awesome Comms team  @ heartofengland who I love working with  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann  @ LordPhilofBrum No  -  he has not yet completed his 3yr term
-1	 @ jhcoakley  @ Jarmann  @ Privateallergy  @ KayFSheldon  @ drp _ stephens  @ NHSwhistleblowr Not at all ,  sadly
-1	 @ Clifford49 Good point  -  an oversight I’m sure .  We should correct next time .  I will action .  Many thanks
-1	Another excellent blog on leadership from a young doctor  @ DrStevenKinnear 
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ heartofengland Definitely David  -  watch at 11
-1	 @ RonBont They are treated very badly by staff too  -  they are trying to do their best and dont deserve the abuse they get
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Chair  @ LordPhilofBrum offering to stay on to implement Kennedy actions
-1	 @ Clifford49 We are looking to correct .  Volunteers viewed positively as far as I am aware Richard ? 
-1	 @ val _ hudson Thank you Val
-1	 @ RobWebster _ LCH Thanks Rob you are very kind .  Have a great Xmas and NY
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ DrGrumble  @ Privateallergy  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann We are on a journey David
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Haven’t expressed a view re mgrs .  Don’t feel strongly about it
-1	 @ profchrisham  @ HSJEditor Yes ,  and support system rather than institution ? 
-1	 @ HPIAndyCowper can I go for a NY winter pressures blog  -  we have perfect week initiative next week which will be good to reflect on ? 
-1	 @ RonBont Hi ,  that car park is controlled separately by Ed Centre ,  for visitors .  Re managers spaces  -  checked and don’t exist officially ! 
-1	 @ MatSilk  @ rogerkline  @ heartofengland Yes  -  she has corporate affairs too but is influential at Board
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr Yes ,  tho interesting IK says they should have gone even further with their concerns ? 
-1	 @ JakeMat91 Looking forward to it Jake ! 
-1	 @ profchrisham Thanks Chris .  Not comfortable but right thing to do so we can move forward
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ gemmarosa  @ NHSChangeday  @ HSCchangeday Yes  -   @ NHSChangeday is great example of influence young can have
-1	Our  @ heartofengland review by Sir Ian Kennedy is released tomorrow .  Expect strong messages re whistle blowing ,  listening and pt centredness
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann I dont think weak .  Is whats needed so we need to work out how to achieve ,  not opt for easier solns ? 
-1	 @ UoBMedLeaders Great to meet you all ,  thanks for inviting me ! 
-1	 @ wwwframeworks4c Thanks I am not taking leave but I will have time with my family  -  I can’t wait ! 
-1	 @ gemmarosa  @ DrStevenKinnear Excellent .  I hope ,  and believe ,  you will find support and encouragement because the service needs you
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann I dont think it is right .  I just dont feel bringing it in for mgrs will change the culture as needed
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Yes ,  is culture and approach ,  not individual mgrs or docs .  Context is all
-1	 @ AnnMarieRiley10  @ heartofengland Hear hear .  Fantastic team work and a great outcome for patients .  Well done all ! 
-1	 @ longland _ sarah Thanks Sarah  -  its been a very long day ! 
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear  @ heartofengland  @ HSJnews Thanks Steven .  Hope you are well ? 
-1	 @ RonBont Whole Ed Centre is separate business  -  has been for some years .  Catering a part of that .  Does confer benefits to Trust
-1	 @ aaronashmore8 Thanks Aaron ,  I like it !  Are you getting hits and ,  more importantly ,  is it having an impact do you know ? 
-1	 @ Manjit49  @ jhcoakley  @ Jarmann  @ Privateallergy  @ KayFSheldon  @ drp _ stephens  @ NHSwhistleblowr Hi Manjit ,  is single biggest issue we face IMO
-1	 @ AnnMarieRiley10  @ SafetySamFoster  @ ecist Great  - it will be an exciting week for everyone ! 
-1	My latest CEO Diary ,  covers our Perfect Week and the Kennedy Breast Care Review 
-1	 @ AnnMarieRiley10  @ DrStevenKinnear  @ HSCchangeday  @ heartofengland  @ Damian _ Roland It is indeed  -  all credit to Ann - Marie for a great idea  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ clarkmike  @ JonNHSNorwich  @ RichardatKF Many thanks Mike
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann You’re entitled to your view of course ,  but all ‘managers’ are not same ! 
-1	 @ RonBont Hi ,  not aware personally but have asked question
-1	 @ drkimholt  @ Privateallergy  @ heartofengland Thats right Kim .  We are saying it loud and clear today though
-1	 @ RMayNurseDir Thank you Ruth .  Challenge is to sustain ,  although just been in and this weekend is going very well ! 
-1	 @ Penbat1  @ DrGrumble  @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann I think rarely  -  more commonly pressure to hit narrow targets
-1	 @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ Jarmann Glad we agree !  I believe change is imminent  -  will happen over next yr or so  # socialmovement will force
-1	 @ LaurenceVick Yes !  Really helpful observation by Sir Ian and one we can use to make some positive changes
-1	 @ MatSilk  @ rogerkline True ,  but we need to work this through because it is the right  ( and only )  approach
-1	 @ Jarmann  @ Privateallergy  @ KayFSheldon  @ drp _ stephens  @ NHSwhistleblowr Mgr bad doctor good not helpful as most mgrs are docs or nurses ? 
-1	 @ DrStevenKinnear Well deserved Steven I agree entirely with your thoughts
-1	 @ NHSwhistleblowr  @ Privateallergy  @ DrGrumble  @ drp _ stephens  @ Jarmann Sure ,  though most named in Review are in fact
-1	 @ EastCoastAdam Just home .  What a fantastic game !
