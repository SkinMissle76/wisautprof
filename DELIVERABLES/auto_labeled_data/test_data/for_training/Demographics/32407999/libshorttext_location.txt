24	 @ FilmBookClub The worst was the one claiming to be Henderson vs Tottenham but was actually Joe Allen . 
24	 @ FilmBookClub The best film is the 5 minute short compilation of all of Jordan Hendersons touches in the Tottenham vs Liverpool game . 
24	 @ GaryTheLunt Invented by Jordan with the use of his trusty time machine Carmichael and a cookbook he got for his birthday last year . 
24	I love Jordan Brian Henderson . 
24	 .  .  .  his ability to convince a top club to give him Â£70 , 000 a week to try hard on the right wing for his first year .  .  . 
24	 .  .  .  his way of pronouncing the word way like hes holding in a waeaye .  .  .  his love for scrabble  & amp ;  boggle .  .  . 
24	 .  .  .  his late runs into the box surprising even the most experienced of defenders  ( even though late runs have been around forever )  . 
24	Birthed on the banks of the river that gave him his name ,  Jordan Brian Henderson was destined to bring hope to those who run funny .  .  . 
24	Jordan Henderson is ,  and this isnt just hyperbole here ,  my favourite Henderson there has ever been .

24	Freshly washed pyjamas are why I decide to keep living .

24	If this Christmas has taught me anything its that Im still young enough to eat loads and not get fat . 
24	 .  .  .  a referee in matches concerning Liverpool .  There might not be a conscious bias necessarily but come on ! 
24	By this I mean Webb being a former Sergeant for SYP ,  the Police force at the centre of the Hillsborough disaster ,  and his performance as .  . 
24	Only just put two and two together with Howard Webb and South Yorkshire Police ,  how is this so rarely brought up ? 
24	Demi Moore ,  yeah like thats a name .  .  . A moor is a place not a person silly .  .  .

24	Ari Graynor .  .  .   * sighs *
