2	
2	What a bunch of marketing crap .  .  .  Now I got this ridiculous promotion and ad in my games history to shill crappy arcade games . 
2	It gives you one for starting the stupid thing .   How annoying especially when xbox will only let you delete games with 0G . 
2	 @ XboxSupport Id like Game Room Achievement History Stricken from my gamertag because it gives you an achievement which ruins my completion %
