-0.3	“ @ RhiainGeers :  Wow .  .  .  such an amazing  # dental makeover on  # embarrassingbodies tonight by  @ DrJamesRussell  ~  she looked great ! ” THANKS ! 
-0.3	 @ RachelFairfiel1  -  you really need to see a dentist !  Not a DIY situation ! 
-0.3	 @ DrDawnHarper  -  she wont be the only one ! 
-0.3	 @ Onedirecti0n _ nz  -  see last reply but no filling should hurt !  Pit fillings often need no or little anaesthetic as shallow . 
-0.3	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  they do contain mercury .  Personally ,  I dont place silver fillings  ( not due to mercury )  but millions are placed every year . 
-0.3	 @ PrimleyParkDen  @ TheInmanAligner  -  glad you enjoyed it !  Have a great weekend !

-0.3	 @ Andy _ Wallace  @ GarethNug  -  thanks Gareth !  Pleased all working out ! 
-0.3	 @ music _ unused  -  still unlikely I think but certainly worth speaking to your dentist and they may be able to make a referral . 
-0.3	“ @ Kees04 :   @ DrJamesRussell Treatment looking good tonight .  Im on next week ,  excited !   # EmbarrassingBodies” Thanks !  Me too ! 
-0.3	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  I only advise removal when there is a reason to do so .  Unless someone wants them removed for aesthetic reasons .

-0.3	 @ CazzagLeland  -  if indicated ,  yes you can .
