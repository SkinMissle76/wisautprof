3	 @ RachelFairfiel1  -  you really need to see a dentist !  Not a DIY situation ! 
3	 @ DrDawnHarper  -  she wont be the only one ! 
3	 @ Onedirecti0n _ nz  -  see last reply but no filling should hurt !  Pit fillings often need no or little anaesthetic as shallow . 
3	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  they do contain mercury .  Personally ,  I dont place silver fillings  ( not due to mercury )  but millions are placed every year . 
3	 @ PrimleyParkDen  @ TheInmanAligner  -  glad you enjoyed it !  Have a great weekend !

3	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  I only advise removal when there is a reason to do so .  Unless someone wants them removed for aesthetic reasons .

3	 @ MissMaiag  -  most likely fixed orthodontics .  Can get worse or stay the same .  Best get a consultation if concerned . 
3	Always great to get an email like this first thing !  Very nervous new patient said  " Hi Olivia ,  i would really like .  .  .

3	 @ SarahMcCarthy07  -  it is normal .  How long has it been ? 
3	 @ becky2psych  -  sorry to hear .  Implants not normally undertaken on NHS .

3	 @ CazzagLeland  -  if indicated ,  yes you can .

3	A few pointers on looking after your teeth !  Simple steps that can help to eliminate most problems !
