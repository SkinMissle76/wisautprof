35	 @ matt _ parkerr  -  meant to say  " just ask for an explanation "   -  sorry ,  missed out  " ask " 
35	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  cant comment on why filling replaced with no info but likely correct ,  just for an explanation to put mind at rest . 
35	 @ VirginTrains  -  OK being fussy but great breakfasts vs poor options at 6 . 45 .  No ice ,  ever  (  ?  !  )  etc etc just different level of service . 
35	Dont understand how the morning service on  @ virgintrains can be so good and the early evening so bad .  .  . 
35	Here is a new Inman Aligner case !  Alignment ,  bleaching and bonding doing its magic !  .  .  .

35	Heres a look back at an old  # embarrassingbodies case .  
35	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  can be many reasons so Id really suggest your dentist has the info to make a diagnosis here . 
35	 @ moletweets  -  very happy to see you for a consultation .  Contact details , fees etc on my website .  
35	“ @ RhiainGeers :  Wow .  .  .  such an amazing  # dental makeover on  # embarrassingbodies tonight by  @ DrJamesRussell  ~  she looked great ! ” THANKS ! 
35	 @ RachelFairfiel1  -  you really need to see a dentist !  Not a DIY situation ! 
35	 @ DrDawnHarper  -  she wont be the only one ! 
35	 @ Onedirecti0n _ nz  -  see last reply but no filling should hurt !  Pit fillings often need no or little anaesthetic as shallow . 
35	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  they do contain mercury .  Personally ,  I dont place silver fillings  ( not due to mercury )  but millions are placed every year . 
35	 @ PrimleyParkDen  @ TheInmanAligner  -  glad you enjoyed it !  Have a great weekend ! 
35	“ @ pixiedoctor :   @ DrJamesRussell nice dental work on  @ EmbBodies ! ”  -  Thank you !  Likewise !

35	 @ pixiedustgem  -  hope it looks as great on TV as in real life !  Hope alls well . 
35	 @ claypot00  -  lack of retainer use when young !  All braces need a retainer after . 
35	 @ Andy _ Wallace  @ GarethNug  -  thanks Gareth !  Pleased all working out ! 
35	 @ music _ unused  -  still unlikely I think but certainly worth speaking to your dentist and they may be able to make a referral . 
35	“ @ Kees04 :   @ DrJamesRussell Treatment looking good tonight .  Im on next week ,  excited !   # EmbarrassingBodies” Thanks !  Me too ! 
35	 @ Matt _ Parkerr  -  I only advise removal when there is a reason to do so .  Unless someone wants them removed for aesthetic reasons . 
35	Sweeeet !  
35	Webinar about to start !  Had to disguise the true horror of the room !  Yes ,  renovations are being planned !

35	 @ fuelledbynature  -  nice to meet you too !  Product looks great !  Very keen on some samples !  Have a great weekend !

35	 @ RachelFairfiel1  -  great to hear .  Hope it went well . 
35	Packed lunches are great .  Healthier ,  less expensive etc .  .  .  Problem is that I always eat it before 11am .  .  .  . and .  .  .  
35	 @ MissMaiag  -  most likely fixed orthodontics .  Can get worse or stay the same .  Best get a consultation if concerned . 
35	Always great to get an email like this first thing !  Very nervous new patient said  " Hi Olivia ,  i would really like .  .  .  
35	“ @ Dizymum :   @ DrJamesRussell how much did all tht guys treatment cost ?  ? ”

35	Great little video from  @ Al _ Humphreys .   
35	 @ scairyclairy  -  finding a dentist who is experienced in taking time and building your confidence is key .  Meds can help but only mask phobia .

35	 @ Lynne _ Fox  -  its very safe if you use the kit given to you by your DENTIST and follow the instructions .  Or have it done in surgery . 
35	 @ SarahMcCarthy07  -  it is normal .  How long has it been ? 
35	 @ becky2psych  -  sorry to hear .  Implants not normally undertaken on NHS .

35	 @ claypot00  -  teeth can move again .  Depends on situation but maybe ask your dentist and at least monitor for change . 
35	Its shocking but well known .  So easily prevented but still a MASSIVE problem  :  -  (  
35	 @ Taylorsteve88  -  you need to see a dentist ASAP . 
35	 @ DrDawnHarper  @ cazzagleland  @ embbodies  -  looking forward to some sofa time Dawn !  Hope alls good . 
35	 @ CazzagLeland  -  if indicated ,  yes you can . 
35	 @ mcally25  -  hard to see ,  likely just enamel cracks which is very common .  You should make sure youre having routine dental checks though . 
35	A few pointers on looking after your teeth !  Simple steps that can help to eliminate most problems !  
35	 @ becky2psych  -  best to know options in advance .  Hope all goes well .
