2	 @ JamesCampion10  @ Phipps15 who the hell would nick that ?  ! 
2	 @ LewDev9 Shouldnt get sacked even if you finish 17th .  Write the season off and let him rebuild in summer .  Lack of quality players . 
2	This serves West Ham right for playing such a weakened team .  Respect the FA cup . 
2	 @ ArgosHelpers  @ KaineRigbyPT I need to do the same .  Can you follow so I can DM please . 
2	Luton should have had this game called off ,  horrendous scenes !  That pitch will be ruined for rest of season now . 
2	Well thats our season over then .  .   # 1manteam
2	Negredo loves an outside of the foot . 
2	Giroud trying his best not to score . 
2	 @  _ JW7 _  So happy Im off work for Xmas ! 
2	 @ J _ lucas _ 89 Ah shit yeah forgot about him !  Lets hope he is back from injury in time and we have a serious chance ! 
2	Suarez is just something else .  If he doesnt get injured before the world cup ,  then he alone will kill us . 
2	5 - 0 Liverpool .  Suarez 2 goals ,  3 assists .  Too good ! 
2	This is going to be messy for Villa
2	What a win that is for the Dons !   # mkdons  # wolves
2	Finished Breaking Bad .  Now what to do !  ? 
2	Wigan away .  Never have any luck with the draw !  Boring
2	 @ tomcampion1 haha he might have a good song but he aint better than Hazard
2	Good decision captaining Suarez in my Fantasy Football team . 
2	 @ Jisan _ Miah Same haha so good
2	Hazard is unreal .  Best player in the prem ? 
2	 @ FirstCC Why was this not on board at station though ?  I drove home for no reason and have now missed it !  Only displayed on website
2	 @ FirstCC Since when was there a train from Biggleswade to LKC at 07 : 25 ?  Why was this not on the board at station after 07 : 07 was cancelled ? 
2	 @ RichardMarvell1 Haha couldnt have chosen a better club to finish his career at !  Still ugly though
2	 @ JamesCampion10  @ AndreGee1 haha so sick if true
2	 @ Liam _ R _ McKenna Yeah not bad at all .  Lallana needs to improve his corners though . 
2	Eminem ft .  Nate Ruess  -  Headlights .  Thisll be number 1 in a few weeks .  Tune . 
2	 @ JamesCampion10 
2	 @ Grainger95 Is that why you play in Kingston ? 
2	What the hell is going on with C4 + 1 ?  Picture with wrong audio  : s
2	4 months left to live turned into 24 hours .  RIP
2	Drinking through the horrific news I received today .  Leeeeeeeeeds
2	 @ KerysJStoker  no worries ,  I hear that a lot !  Haha .  Good to hear x
2	 @ KerysJStoker yeah Im good thanks ,  all good with you ?  Did my tip work ? 
2	 @ KerysJStoker doesnt surprise me haha

2	 @ moralee7  @ raffers10 29 for me as well
2	First train into london is at 17 : 35 and I finish work at 17 : 30 .  .  Hmmm
2	 @ RichardMarvell1 Get in !  I really hope that happens !  Thatll be at least a 2 hour line in
2	 @ RichardMarvell1 Nah I didnt get anything .  Where did you see that ? 
2	 @ RichardMarvell1 Praying a tree falls on the line . 
2	Would love MK to draw Biggleswade away !  Easiest away day commute Id ever have ! 
2	 @ AdamBrewster1 Arteta was still last man though .  Cham only had to run through to goal with a team mate along side him .  Koschielny no chance
2	 @ AdamBrewster1 Hes right though .  Red was correct decision
2	Just seen Wilsheres goal .  Incredible ! 
2	 @ raffers10 Starting watching it yesterday myself .  Done 4 episodes so far .  Made for a pretty disrupted day at work . 
2	 @ LewDev9 overrated ! 
2	Dropping Lampard for Carrick was a mistake . 
2	Why have the FA given them 18 , 000 tickets ?  !  Morons
2	 @ raffers10 Fuming .  One of them gets 60k a year in benefits and is being moved into a brand new 500k house . 
2	On Benefits  & amp ;  Proud  -  These wasters need to be put down .  Give me back my money . 
2	 @ J _ lucas _ 89 Ahh decent !  Not long till youll be getting into League 2 footy . 
2	 @ J _ lucas _ 89 Haha his looks have improved .  .  . slightly .  Top player for MK though . 
2	What is it about Milner ?  How does he always manage to get on the pitch at some point ?  ! 
2	MK Dons made Andros Towsend . 
2	Why are people surprised to see Townsend in the starting line up ?  Have they not watched any prem games this season ? 
2	Pretty tempted to put a bet on Belgium reach the WC final .  .  .  Such a strong team . 
2	Townsend is top class .  Deserves to start ,  always a threat . 
2	The Simpsons are killing off a main character  : o Bart ? 
2	Ahh 2 pints and a packet of crisps !  Finally something good on TV . 
2	Scott Brown you moron !  Stupid red card
2	 @ JamesCampion10  @ RichardMarvell1  @ raffers10  @ tomcampion1  @ js0692 Gives me shivers .  Guy in picture looks like he has just got back from there
2	Just seen this land in stadium car park 
2	
2	 @ LewDev9 Haha been getting banter for a while about the functionality bit ! 
2	 @ LewDev9 Haha too late .  Picking my iPhone up in an hour !  Went for White ,  but now everyone at work is saying thats the female version ! 
2	Black or White iPhone ?  ! 
2	How is Van Ginkel able to play on from that ?  !  Ouch ! 
2	Aluko that is some finish !  Great technique
2	Queue outside Apple on Regent Street is mad !  Do these people not work !  ? 
2	Trying to have a conversation with someone when you have pretty much fully lost your voice is so frustrating !  Need to learn sign asap ! 
2	Throat is in tatters .  Feels like im swallowing razor blades
2	 @ raffers10 Yeah Luton are pretty poor
2	Good to see BT Sport showing some proper football .   # LUFC  # WFC
2	Perfectly cooked .  Malia recovery begins .  
2	Nothing beats steak 
2	Getting the train home from London that I see every morning when on my way to work .  .  So tired .  Buzzing for bed . 
2	 @ Phipps15 is there any point in adding this number ? 
2	Great win !  Still unbeaten in the league  # Mkdons
2	Blow the whistle !  ! 
2	A Bayern player deserves to get injured soon with all this pathetic play acting . 
2	Top class Torres !  Clinical . 
2	Last day at work and then 2 weeks off ,  oh ,  and Malia on Tuesday !   # buzz
2	 @ AndyBarker69  @ FirstCC Haha ,  the 19 : 33 is too bloody late !  Cant argue with that ,  the first thing I do is work out my quickest way home ! 
2	 @ FirstCC Your website now says that theres a train at 15 : 35 ,  then not one until 19 : 33 .  Please explain ?  Some of us need to get home from work
2	 @ FirstCC Then why on your website does it say itll take 27 minutes ? 
2	 @ FirstCC 18 : 23 amended timetable from Kings Cross to Biggleswade ,  is that direct to Bwade ?  Or slow train ? 
2	Ahh Stand By Me ,  what a film ! 
2	 @ Bobalicious _  Horrific .  Judging by his facebook ,  his mum has only just found out ,  or is still yet to .  Awful . 
2	 @ Bobalicious _  Wonder how it happened .  Pretty bad . 
2	Apparently 15yr old drowned in Biggs earlier ,  guess that explains the helicopters !  2 deaths in a month ! 
2	 @  _ stevie _ black _  Cannot tell if this is sarcasm or not haha
2	 @  _ stevie _ black _  Well ,  Galloway was playing LB and didnt give him a sniff ,  so i would assume so ? 
2	 @  _ stevie _ black _  Brendon Galloway you mean ? 
2	 @ Jisan _ Miah Both were pens but red card was harsh . 
2	What a debut !  Rickie Lambert ! 
2	Grant Hanley what a prick
2	Really dont rate Gerrard for England .  Been so poor in recent games
2	1 - 1 !  Get in !

2	
2	 @ BTSport signed up 20 minutes ago .  Cant login yet and still no confirmation email .  Advise please ? 
2	I hope Daniel Pelkas mum and step father are tortured daily for the rest of their lives in prison .

2	Great goalkeeping
2	 @ tomcampion1 More
2	 @ collett _ 93  @ gleeson _ stephen Yeah most probably ! 
2	 @ gleeson _ stephen I reckon its David Bentley .   # mkdons
2	Playing football with people that dont have a footballing brain is so damn frustrating
2	Torres ,  Mata ,  Villa ,  Navas ,  Silva ,  Cazola ,  Albiol ,  Valdes ,  Reina ,  Azpilicueta  -  All on Spains bench !  Would all make England starting 11  # mad
2	Ahh the picture is so far behind the commentary !  Heard the goal before I saw it . 
2	This is happening right outside my office  -  
2	Shits going down in London ,  police everywhere
2	Had to call 999 because my collegue passed out from drink and was unresponsive .  Embarrassing . 
2	 @ Jisan _ Miah Thanks mate ,  il get the vks in ! 
2	 @ Phipps15 Cheers mate
2	 @ raffers10 Thanks mate
2	Apart from Wilshere ,  there is not a single player I look forward to seeing play for England .  The squad is probably the worst Ive seen . 
2	Are they using a mobile phone to broadcast this game ? 
2	 @ JamesCampion10  @ SkySportsNews Yeah haha .  Such a boring line up though
2	Wattttfffoooorrrrddd  # buzzing

2	 @ JamesCampion10 Yup saw it haha
2	IVANOVICH !  !  !
