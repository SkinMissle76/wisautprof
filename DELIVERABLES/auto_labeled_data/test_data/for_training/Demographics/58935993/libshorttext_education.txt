3	 @ MisterGurd  @ snanua Dare I ask what a  " Nork "  is ?  Is it a Sonny - ism ? 
3	 @ tmoitie Ive heard some great reviews about Optimizely ,  but the pricing put me off a little .  Would you recommend it ? 
3	 @ tmoitie I honestly dont know .  Carolina look awful this season .  Mind you ,  Cams former teammates at Auburn said hes not a team player . 
3	This little dude gave the  @ detroitpistons  " Dancing Usher "  ,  a run for his money !

3	 @ KunalGandhi Ive driven from Wolves to Colchester ,  so I feel your pain there !  Nottinghams just manic ,  and will be until 2015 apparently ! 
3	New Orleans Pelicans ?  Seriously ?  !  The name hardly instills fear now ,  does it ?  Now ,  which marketing agency came up with that bright idea ! 
3	LSU vs .  Alabama .  One of the greatest games of football  ( of the American kind )  I have ever seen .  Rawkus ,  intense and thrilling .  Brilliant ! 
3	Whilst in  # NYC ,  I bumped into a guy ,  outside  # TrumpTower ,  who I mistakenly thought was  # Shaq .  Any idea who he is ?

3	 @ BigunitD I was determined to get the Nexus 4 .  It sold out in 20 mins ,  so I imagine when stock is replenished ,  itll disappear just as fast . 
3	 @ MisterGurd  @ snanua  @ ragsta86 Sorry lads ,  cant do this wknd now .  Been busy with my bros wedding  & amp ;  in NYC next week ,  so will catch up soon .

3	That was a nasty knee injury to one of College Footballs hottest RBs ,  Marcus Lattimore .  Hope its not as bad as it looks !   # Gamecocks .

3	Congrats to the As on winning the AL Western Division .  The postseason looks like its set to be a goodn !

3	Id love to see  # LSU give  # UGA an ass - whooping today .  I can then wear my Tigers jersey with pride ,  during the big game at Wembley tomorrow ! 
3	With the new season underway ,  Ive decided to start following NCAA College Football .  .  .  just as soon as I can get my head round it all !

3	 @ penelopehh Haha ,  yep ,  suited and booted indeed .  I tell you what ,  I could get used to this lavish lifestyle !   : P
3	Great win over the Chargers to take us to 5 - 4 for the season .  If we keep up this winning momentum ,  we may even make it to the playoffs !

3	 @ whychoose3  @ NFLGamePass I experienced problems with  @ espnplayer a few weeks ago ,  during live college football .  Its just not good enough . 
3	 @ BigunitD I think Im sitting on the halfway line ,  a few rows from the field ,  so I should be in a prime position to get some good snaps ! 
3	Just when the  # Bucs looked to take a turn for the worse ,  Eric Wright stepped up with a fantastic interception returned for a 60yd touchdown . 
3	 @ tmoitie UX is a great field to specialise in .  Its really interesting .  AB testing is vital ,  especially where major changes are involved .

3	 @ tmoitie Ah ,  youve got the Brady Bunch !  Theyve had a load of snow up there too .  Could be a good game . 
3	Looks like the Louisiana Superdome must share the same electricity suppliers as Craven Cottage .  Huge power failure .  May as well blame Tebow . 
3	 @ carlhughes23  @ penelopehh 4 - 1 ?  !  You must be smashed already !  No chance of that scoreline !  Ill take a 3 - 2 win .  .  .  to the  # Rams obviously !

3	Just switched on the baseball ,  only to see the Oakland Athletics fans having a  " mad moment "  .  What is this  # BalfourRage craze all about ? 
3	Cant believe how unlucky my  # Bucs were to lose like that .  We were quite literally an inch away from tying the game to take it to OT .  Gutted . 
3	Finished 41 - 34 .  Harsh loss to take .  Huge decision made in the booth with the penultimate play ,  that could have cost us from tying the game . 
3	Bragging rights remain to be ours for another few months .  Well done lads .  Great win for our city .   # DerbyTilIDie
3	Congrats to Texas A & amp ; Ms QB ,  Johnny Manziel ,  on winning the 2012 Heisman Trophy  -  the 1st ever freshman to throw for 3000 yds  & amp ;  run for 1000 .

3	On the upside ,  the team performed outstandingly ,  particularly on offence .  Freeman and Jackson combined to put up some magnificent numbers .

3	 @ dcfcofficial Thanks for RT !  It was an honour to meet DCFC legends ,  both past  & amp ;  present .  1st time in corporate hospitality  -  fab experience !
