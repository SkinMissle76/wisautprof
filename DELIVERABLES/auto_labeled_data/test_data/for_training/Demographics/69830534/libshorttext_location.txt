14	 @ LiamCJordan think it may have been a convenient way to drop out of both cups though .  Sad really . 
14	 @ LiamCJordan ludicrous decision .  They have a chance against Man City over 1 leg but not 2 . 
14	 @ LiamCJordan Good job West Ham rested those players at the weekend .  .  .  . 
14	 @ dillusion1979 not soft ,  its not a bad choice actually .  Can only really make 2 armies from the daemon book and 1 is a 14 scores capped  @  12
14	 @ dillusion1979 if I hadnt played you before then I may have but not a massive fan of the grudge system .  As I say not 100 %  on going anyway
14	 @ dillusion1979 no because your warmachines will win the game against my daemons .  Not 100 %  sure Im going yet . 
14	 @ dillusion1979 so ambushing flesh hounds ,  Ill fix my list ! 
14	 @ dillusion1979 I thought Swedish was supposed to help make armies that are fun to play against  :  -  / 
14	 @ dillusion1979 what score is that under Swedish ? 
14	 @ dillusion1979 so you are saying I should definitely bring 2 cannons ? 
14	 @ dafruk1 away and sometimes it takes time to bed in .  More important is probably the change in back room staff and the fact they overachieved
14	 @ dafruk1 oh I know but Im not going to bother to look it up .  Any new manager will see a period of upheaval .  Sometimes it works straight
14	 @ dafruk1 who cares ?  The league wasnt own last year ,  it was gifted by City and Chelsea .  Without RVP they were very average .  See this year
14	 @ adembskibowden and thats why she is an ex - girlfriend
14	 @ Stevewren unicorn face ,  not an orse .  Fave looks ace though
14	 @ parttimer _ jw  @ DanComeau  @ HoboMcG once a hydra ,  always a hydra .  Only way out is in death
14	 @ DanComeau  @ HoboMcG  @ parttimer _ jw wooden spoon counts ! 
14	 @ HoboMcG  @ DanComeau  @ parttimer _ jw cakes of ace ! 
14	 @ DanComeau  @ parttimer _ jw should get  @ HoboMcG  involved as well
14	 @ ginger _ buddha roughly same size as chaos hounds if I recall .  Warts are a little bigger if thats what you are after
14	Seriously people have to stop running out of Man Utd jokes soon ? 
14	
14	 @ parttimer _ jw didnt realise Chris Tapper moved to NZ
14	 @ parttimer _ jw luckily I was sitting here with my cock out
14	 @ parttimer _ jw pics . 
14	 @ DanComeau interested in the Brighton tournament ? 
14	 @ ginger _ buddha just give them away .  I feel like giving you a few  $  coincidentally .   ;  -  ) 
14	 @ ginger _ buddha any spare minions ?  Few lasses I know love this army
14	 @ TheGreatGobso the last 2 yes ,  thats what they are .  Bret weapons as lances ?  Which ones ? 
14	 @ Rhellion which argument ?  The two are misunderstood a lot
14	 @ Garagehammer  @ cwalker690  @ TK _ lenny  @ TLMayesing or they are being attacked as they retire back to Nuln late campaign
14	 @ Garagehammer  @ cwalker690  @ TK _ lenny  @ TLMayesing in a game where the artillery school is being attacked its fine at lower points
14	 @ Stevewren see my other tweets to Dave and Andy ? 
14	 @ dafruk1 40K supplements .  Their features are generally ok .  Their news and opinions on GW generally incorrect / late / uninformed
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline exactly what I am saying .  They are missing the point
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline any review of GW stuff based purely on tournament play is missing the point . 
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline doesnt mean you should be misinterpreting the material just that you should be adjusting said review . 
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline 40K supplements ,  so WAAC focused they always miss the point .  Independent Characters get it and review is so much better . 
14	Great to hear Worlds End Radio completely missing the point again .  Getting close to stopping listening
14	 @ BadDice _ Podcast struggle to take flesh hounds off with banishment ,  have MR3 but agree with the general sentiment re  @ BenJohnson0013 army
14	 @ Garagehammer  @ cwalker690  @ TK _ lenny  @ TLMayesing yet more than 1 steam tank has taken the field .  It can be fluff if in the right army
14	 @ DanComeau I did wonder ,  no worries . 
14	 @ DanComeau hey man ,  you getting my messages ? 
14	 @ tmarichards your tweets are not light hearted .  You pretend they might be .  Many a true word said in jest  ;  -  ) 
14	 @ tmarichards or they are enjoying the game . 
14	 @ tmarichards why  ?  Whats wrong with someone taking a unit they like ? 
14	 @ BenJohnson0013  @ Raffazza  @ MikeyGolem  @ Marcoos14  @ Tom _ Mawdsley ahh groovy ,  cheers dude . 
14	Have the English ETC community reps been announced yet ?  Not sure Ive seen anything but might have just missed it
14	 @ BadDice _ Podcast I got Morathi in combat ,  killing blowed Armstrongs Slaan .  Missed the neg LD rule though .  . 
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline  @ dillusion1979  @ Syneri doesnt have to .  People can take other armies . 
14	 @ crouchingotter  @ ginger _ buddha The first half of the last episode season 2 is amazeballs
14	 @ crouchingotter Woah Tiri .  Lilyhammer has got a bit HBO
14	 @ wraightc tthis performance has been coming for a year and a half .  Well maybe not quite this bad but we have been getting away with it . 
14	 @ Filmcorai second favourite legion .  Plus spire guard and hopefully custodes and sisters of silence . 
14	 @ Filmcorai a marine in a number of years .  Hoping to finish 3 war hammer armies this year so might have time either . 
14	 @ Filmcorai sweet ,  I know I will add to my Space Wolves when the do the battle for Prospero so Im holding off .  Not that Ive painted
14	 @ Filmcorai yeah good luck  ;  -  ) 
14	 @ Filmcorai is this instead of your black Templars or as well it did you finish them already ? 
14	 @ Sandals _ ajw on small pieces I doubt the mould could deal with that much variation in angle so its not really a choice but a need
14	 @ Stevewren  @ Sandals _ ajw only if you want to convert .  If you are a noob then its ace
14	 @ Sandals _ ajw they kinda have to because the wont fit the mold properly otherwise x
14	 @ Sandals _ ajw yeah come on lets look at other miniature companies .  .  .  . 
14	So pleased for Thomas Rosicky .  A quality player but his greatest quality is his attitude .  Works soo hard . 
14	 @ Chippy _ Rick not overplaying him ,  dont want to exhaust him .  Plus we have soo many qualities players there
14	 @ crouchingotter sason 1 was good .  2 episodes into season 2 and its ace .  Glad to hear they are filming season 3  ( or planning to start soon ) 
14	 @ Stevewren  @ ukrocky90 Its good but not that bad .  Maybe should have been 55pts though
14	 @ LaurieGoulding Ill let you off on that one then .   ;  -  )  I still love a roast though .  One of my favourite foods  :  - p
14	 @ LaurieGoulding Is both acceptable as a cooking method and a dish .   ;  -  ) 
14	 @ LaurieGoulding but you of all people should know that words change .  Irish stew is served as a meal and thus the term stew .  . 
14	 @ JakSpedding no worries dude . 
14	 @ LaurieGoulding but Irish stew is a food you can order .  Is it an Irish person stewed or is it the name of the dish ? 
14	 @ crouchingotter hey man ,  was it you who recommended Lilyhammer ? 
14	First series of Lilyhammer was good .  The first episode of season 2 is epic .  Love the refernces and the Music
14	List in for Winter War ,  last second change just to keep people guessing .   @ EnchantedbyTim You are going down . 
14	 @ DanComeau  @ the _ black _ sun really doesnt sound like he is from London .  Most misunderstood accent ever ? 
14	Yeah shouldnt have bothered turning the cricket on . 
14	 @ LaurieGoulding  @ lyon _ gm yes ,  go to a lot of tournies ,  some VC armies have a few in their lists so need multiple models .  Law of averages .  . 
14	 @ johnshfrench Just dont let on ,  someone will come shut you down .  .  .  . 
14	 @ Salarymanuk  @ dafruk1  @ TerryPike84  @ Frosty8269 You dont have to take Beasts !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
14	 @ johnshfrench Are you telling me one of you Authory types actually plays the blooming game once in a while .   ;  -  ) 
14	Al Murray on Comedy Central now .  Go watch . 
14	To be fair to Lilyhammer it may be obvious in some places but really throws some good twists in . 
14	 @ MikeyGolem I like yours .   ( Not that Im listening or know anything abot the lists )  .  Yours is the bestest . 
14	 @ Garagehammer  @ HeelanHammer  @ TopherChrisYu  $ 200 million ?  Thats like Â£20 million right ?  I smile when I drop a hell heart sometimes .   ;  -  ) 
14	 @ HeelanHammer  @ TopherChrisYu No I really wouldnt .  I may even smile . 
14	 @ the _ black _ sun  @ DanComeau    Dan Homo is ace .  We really dont live in London though . 
14	 @ kennylull hmm maybe .  What do you actually want to talk about ? 
14	 @ TopherChrisYu best bit about GH was the 40K discussion -  allies etc and getting most of it wrong  ;  -  ) 
14	 @ TopherChrisYu others just seemed to be filling air time .  Not really bad just bleh . 
14	 @ TopherChrisYu one had a fair bit of negativity carefully disguised but also a lot of hypocrisy in what they like / dont like . 
14	 @ ukrocky90 because there arent enough options for fate decks already .  .  . 
14	 @ kennylull  @ blacklibrary  @ CombatPhasePodc BL is in Nottingham .  Probably will be tomorrow .   :  -  ) 
14	 @ PanzerHarris for stable regular tournies maybe .  But you know roughly when they will occur .  New ones not so
14	 @ PanzerHarris its not a gripe ,  you only how so many spaces in the calendar ,  just think newer Tournies especially should advertise early
14	 @ PanzerHarris yes you are ,  not for everyone maybe but for some .  Just a good idea to get the date out early even if pack is later
14	Generally underwhelmed with the Christmas editions of warhammer podcasts Ive listened to . 
14	 @ PanzerHarris a date is always good .  Had almost committed to team event but will hold off now .  Need to plan this year . 
14	 @ varghulf just shows how ridiculous the rankings are . 
14	 @ EnchantedbyTim ahhhh .  .  .  . 
14	 @ PanzerHarris have the details for MKGT been put anywhere yet ? 
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline  @ EnchantedbyTim schweet ,  just have to write an anti lizard army now  ;  -  ) 
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline ok  @ EnchantedbyTim and I have a grudge please . 
14	 @ Andy _ Trampoline are grudges allowed at winter war . 
14	Oh Calas Typhon ,  you look so pretty .  . 
14	 @ EnchantedbyTim ok Im still game but only fair to say I am bringing a more competitive army than I was when I grudged you
14	 @ EnchantedbyTim sent you a tweet .  Wondered if you wanted to get it on at reading bit that was when I thought I might be taking daemons . 
14	 @ EnchantedbyTim  @ Andy _ Trampoline hid from my challenge then ?  X
14	 @ HoboMcG  @ DanComeau not a lot .  . 
14	Only just got up today  # thankyousuperman 
14	 @ mwills11 youre a fucking frog ! 
14	 @ Marcoos14 play better .  .  . 
14	 @ RTGamer nope ,  just need a book to write down spells etc .  Might keep a W / L / D record .  Might record how many games I play campaign / fun etc
14	 @ RTGamer to write down stuff during my games of warhammer
14	Just about got my Warhammer notes book in time for the new season ,  all ready for 100 games this year . 
14	 @ TopherChrisYu suspect it would be group purchasing it and splitting it up .  If I was getting into 40K id be tempted to get a group together
14	 @ varghulf you seem to have added tax authorities on the end of that last tweet . 
14	 @ TopherChrisYu who would buy the space marine chapter ,  they sold at least 1 over here ,  maybe 2 if what I heard was correct
14	 @ dafruk1 hahahahaha .  But shes a woman ,  all the other guys love her cos she has tits .  The boss doesnt like confrontation ,  I may have a word
14	 @ TrimControls she thinks she runs the place and does what ever she wants .  I just want to slap her please
14	 @ TrimControls sure you would be saying that if it happened to you and you might not be able to take that time off . 
14	before we even start work this year the silly bint has booked off every Friday before a bank holiday weekend .  Anyone want to come slap her
14	 @ DanComeau  @ markthebeastman no ,  you are shit .  List was just bad .   :  - p
14	 @ crouchingotter always work for gangster actors .  The show is good ,  the premise works well in its favour . 
14	 @ crouchingotter first ,  Its good .  Bit different
14	Woah ,  Lilyhammer is still getting weirder . 
14	
14	 @ Gas _ Monkey82 nah ,  the idiot Dane rarely contributes when required .  That kind of win is what we havent done the last 8 years
14	 @ Gas _ Monkey82 nah its ok .  Theos goal would have won the game .  B52s wasnt required . 
14	Nicklas Bendtner .  Arsenal legend ?  ?  ? 
14	I have a load of Battlefleet Gothic Chaos ships that I am selling ,  Get in touch if you are interested . 
14	 @ HeelanHammer only stores likely to be open are ones in large shopping centres .  Bluewater ,  lakeside etc
14	 @ Rubicon _ Eagle its ok .  Tim Sherwood might be the man to lead them to greatness .  .  .  .  . 
14	 @ Rubicon _ Eagle a time for spurs fans to get terribly excited before a huge disappointment . 
14	So big day ,  transfer window is open people . 
14	Bloody fireworks ,  people are trying to sleep !   :  - p
14	 @ Rhellion they do .   @ MikeyGolem used him well .  I like him . 
14	 @ Apostlegillus  @ Rhellion eBay protects buyers in general though
14	 @ Rhellion problem is you cant seethe lack of quality that may exist when looking online .  There are some scams going on as well
14	 @ NickKyme my old man loved it .  Really want to watch it myself
14	 @ Rhellion be careful ,  get what you pay for
14	 @  _ wee _ men  @ Garagehammer they do different bacon . 
14	 @ Garagehammer exactly ,  why do you go to tournies ?  To have fun ,  so do what you want and have fun . 
14	 @ Marcoos14  @ lyon _ gm they are making a version of the hobbit .  Book and film are different beasts ,  same with any adaptation . 
14	 @ Marcoos14  @ lyon _ gm why does having something to go with the novel affect the film ?  It had its own small issues but not this
14	 @ ukrocky90 30 Bestigor ,  40 Gor ,  Jabberslyth
14	 @ lizzytombs usually only see it on at 10pm and I never know why . 
14	 @ PanzerHarris  @ Trevs _ Twit  @ dafruk1 hobby craft do plasticote
14	The Burbs is on ,  actually during the day time .  I love that film
14	 @ IanCarse87 groovy .  Trying to get a paint scheme that doesnt take me for ever to do . 
14	 @ IanCarse87 you think ?  Wasnt 100 %  on the feet cloth but dont want a colour that requires too many layers
14	Testy model .  Kinda growing on me 
14	 @ Trevs _ Twit Runelord Brass ish and Runefang Silver
14	 @ DrJanNovak It was the stories that dragged on and went no - where .  Didnt add to the story .  Needed a good editor
14	 @ DrJanNovak no ,  makes me annoyed .  Could have used characters in much better ways .  Could have cut at least 2 books worth . 
14	 @ DrJanNovak and poorly written in places and far too much detail and mis - using characters but is great fun
14	Also finished The Wheel of Time tonight .  to be honest I just wanted it finished .  Enjoyable but annoying
14	 @ NationOfLee nah think green will stand out a touch more .  One if the few bits in certain of
14	Start of the colour scheme .  Green gems .  Hmm maybe 
14	 @ parttimer _ jw ok .  Youre very simple xxx
14	 @ parttimer _ jw its really very simple .   :  -  )  xxx
14	 @ OGGames sort the website out !   :  - p did some clearing up and found some though
14	 @ OGGames Hey man ,  when are you getting your metal and magnetic sheets in ? 
14	I fecking hate metal models
14	For some reason I thought I needed to paint 20 more models for my SCGT army than I do .  This could be on . 
14	 @ parttimer _ jw bigger the base ,  more likely it is
14	Does anyone want to buy some Ellyrian Reavers from the Island of Blood set ? 
14	 @ gavinfwatson hmm maybe .  Might be a bit small
14	 @ The _ Deathwatch that would be too easy but yeah Vamps ruined many of my days . 
14	Remind me a day or 2 before but yes ,  the bits are ready to return
14	 @ Salarymanuk  @ Khaosgoblin they get magic attacks because of the ensorcelles blades .  If they change to lances the dont .  Its a magic weapon
14	 @ Salarymanuk  @ Khaosgoblin magic weapons .  its what ensorcelled is .  Thats why you dont give them a flaming banner unless a hero is there
14	 @ Salarymanuk  @ Khaosgoblin where are they usually played that way ?  ?  ?  ? 
14	Ok then ,  at it again .  Need a bare torso to fit on top of the Slaanesh Boobworm rider .  Ideally no cutting up required . 
14	 @ Sandals _ ajw  @ wilw you should see the  @ WatchItPlayed series on it .  Special panda and gardener pieces
14	 @ crouchingotter  @ Garagehammer and they still want everything released the same day . 
14	 @ crouchingotter  @ Garagehammer but everything gets released the same day .  Its also not in GW stores .  Happens every January . 
14	 @ Garagehammer no .  Everything is a week behind due to not being get deliveries to stores . 
14	 @ jormi _ boced no negative personal ones here .  Plenty not personal ,  did you listen to the 40K radio rants ? 
14	 @ jormi _ boced shame about the main bloke behind it .  .  . 
14	 @ jormi _ boced looked interesting ,  I wonder how well it delivers .  Wont be buying it though
14	Some more toys for the fluff armies 
14	 @ BadDice _ Podcast I could be in . 
14	 @ rob _ the _ bob86 where do you buy them from ? 
14	 @ rob _ the _ bob86 6 "  tall ?  plus lifting off the base ?  The Dragons get used . 
14	
14	 @ TrackTenUK ordered a small pot on amazon yesterday .   :  -  ) 
14	 @ dillusion1979 yeah drop the cannons
14	 @ mwills11 You listened to the live Tuesday club cast ?  Bloody hilarious
14	For sale .  .  .  
14	Anyone want to buy an iPhone charger ?  The old style  -  not lightning . 
14	 @ Chippy _ Rick  @ Stevewren wouldnt bet on it .  No one good enough will be allowed to leave their own club
14	 @ Stevewren  @ Chippy _ Rick cant go a season without a few injuries .  Have lots of centre mids to take his place .  Its a squad game . 
14	 @ the _ black _ sun good lad , 
14	 @ Aeth _ 1904 Â£1 million to take him ? 
14	 @ Chippy _ Rick  @ Stevewren Great to him back ,  Quality and experience .  Looks like a really good building block of a very good team .
