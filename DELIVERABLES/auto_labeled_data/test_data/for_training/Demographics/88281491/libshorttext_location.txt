3	Austria scored a late goal to bring it back to 2 - 1 in the 80th minute ,  i took no chances and corner flagged it
3	Despite a controversial 3rd goal against Australia ,  we stormed to a 4 - 1 win .  Another remarkable performance from Chile
3	Had to come back from 2 - 0 down to scrap a draw in the 88th minute against a surprisingly strong Swiss side
3	We put the hard work in and came out on top ,  3 - 1
3	Ive got Spain next in stickman soccer ,  going to be a tough round

3	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 thats got nothing to do with whether someone supports a team or not though
3	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 you shouldnt be so controversial is youre not looking for a nibble then davo
3	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 buuttt if someone doesnt support a team it doesnt mean they shouldnt be allowed to talk about football
3	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 you shouldnt take the piss if its just pointless slagging off because yeah it cant be returned
3	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 thats rubbish davo
