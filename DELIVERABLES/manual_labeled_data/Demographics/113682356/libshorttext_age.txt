-0.58	 @ StewFisher Ive been royally shot down over this opinion today ,  not a single person in agreement .  Disappointing at best . 
-0.58	Smart casual dress is ample for software developers .  Smart clothing should be reserved for meeting clients .   # unpopularopinion
-0.58	Going to bed now .  Not impressed that this was necessary . 
-0.58	 @ StewFisher  @ YouTube YT needed help to become viable .  Going off Apps though ,  even for free its not worth the hassle
-0.58	The day Google builds a non - search web application that isnt buggy as shit will be the day the web finally wins out .  GCal is godawful . 
-0.58	2 project go - lives in one night .  Satisfying way to start the new year despite the smouldering infrastructure  \ o / 
-0.58	These bad boys finally arrived :  Sennheiser HD 558s .  So comfortable .  
-0.58	 @ Ajzahtiri maybe it was to fast track you into using the language / runtime so you better understood the technical side ?  Not normal practice
-0.58	 @ Ajzahtiri you learn to technical specs when youre working with indecisive clients ,  believe me .  They protect both sides from feature creep
-0.58	Wireless charging ?  Psht 
-0.58	 @ twbootstrap is ultimately still a toy until its JS is ported to more sane frameworks like YUI .  Another  @ twitter engineering trainwreck ! 
-0.58	 .  .  . and the dog just knocked a massive glass bowl out of mums hands .  Make that  " pets in general "  .  .  . 
-0.58	Just stepped on the cats paw because the blithering idiot stood right next to me trying to get food .  No sympathy .  Domestic cats are stupid . 
-0.58	The polar bears getting jiggy with it 
-0.58	 @ Ajzahtiri so coincidence ,  much strange ,  wow

-0.58	HAH !  Snapchats  " abuse "  blog post neglects to tell users that they failed to address the flaw for weeks before the  " abuse "  took place  * sigh * 
-0.58	The behemoth has been defeated .  Tomb Raider at 5760x1080 is unplayable at times even on normal graphics settings .  Those GTX 660 Tis must go ! 
-0.58	Wow :  
-0.58	 @ StewFisher no ,  that one is literally useless .  DrawCaptcha . toString (  )  shows that the value of the captcha is stored in the DOM . 
-0.58	 @ StewFisher  @ callumacrae inspect the source ,  its utterly pointless
-0.58	 @ StewFisher how quaint
-0.58	 @ StewFisher  .  .  . but if the conservatives win the upper class will thrive and everyone else will starve
-0.58	And this is exactly why sane people self host :

-0.58	So chucking thousands of requests at Gios async methods is unwise .  gvfsd - http crashes  _ lots _  .  Guess I ought to rate limit those .  .  .   * sigh * 
-0.58	 @ rninty _  yessir ,  so good at handling multiple displays .  I live on workspaces ,  especially when Im using my laptop . 
-0.58	 @ StewFisher would rather use Shell to be honest ,  so much pretty .  When  @ nvidia start shipping decent drivers well be sorted  :  ) 
-0.58	 @ StewFisher Mint suffers from all the same issues and comes with the Cinnamon Challenge too .  Aint nobody got time fo dat
-0.58	I love Ubuntu ,  but really !  ?  
-0.58	Chapter 8 of Mirrors Edge .  All I can think is  " thank f *  *  *  thats nearly over "  .  Such a promising idea destroyed by terrible level design .  .  . 
-0.58	 @ emily _ bradbury I only just woke up  : s

-0.58	Great article on being a better developer / engineer :  
-0.58	Went to see Frozen .  Not a bad film ,  but its definitely no Anchorman 2 . 
-0.58	Hint :  check the Subsonic event log for issues like these .  Transcoder error output is recorded here . 
-0.58	Subsonic web players not working since upgrade to 4 . 9 ?  Settings  -  & gt ;  Transcoders ,  replace occurrences of  - preset with  - vpre .  Yw  ;  ) 
-0.58	 @ Ajzahtiri Google missed a trick by not making the messages app work like the people one .  It would be cool if all apps did messaging there
-0.58	Why not just mute the affected audio ,   @ youtube ?  Youre destroying your platform .  .  .  
-0.58	Ubisofts QA team are a prime example of why we cant have nice things .   @ ubisoftsupport AC3 would be amazing if it werent so bug ridden
-0.58	 @ DavidMaitland  @ OllieRussell8  @ BradGibbs _  either is better than the current fluff though Dave
-0.58	 @ BradGibbs _   @ OllieRussell8 just thought ,  there he resembles Brandon Flowers  ( Killers ) 
-0.58	User interface design with Glade would probably be simple if I had the first clue how to stick together the widgets 
-0.58	 @ benjeh32 does iOS have a battery usage indicator like the Android one ?  
-0.58	Pretty sure Id be incapable of living without the wonder that is Syndol .  Migraines suck .

-0.58	 @ tdmderrin lost his pint .  .  .   : o 
-0.58	 @ StewFisher not worth it ,  they dont give two shits how poor our transport network is . 
-0.58	Whittle have really redefined the term  " weapons grade cunts "  today .  Wish they had a Twitter handle so theyd see this . 
-0.58	Hopefully this Secret Santa present tomorrow will be interpreted as a joke and not straight up misogyny .  Tough one this year .  .  .   : s
-0.58	 @ gruber Maybe I need my eyes testing ,  then ,  because they sure dont look aesthetically appealing to me  :  / 
-0.58	 @ gruber You are buying a machine that looks like a cheap plastic fucking bin ,  so I guess the display will be a pleasant change ? 
-0.58	Gos encoding / xml documentation is absolutely fracking awful .  Wheres the example section ,  guys ? 
-0.58	 @ OllieRussell8 no spoilers please !  Do want to go see it
-0.58	Then . lys AI1EC plugin for WordPress is a fantastic example of why all WordPress developers should be burned at the stake .   # nope
-0.58	 .  .  . then run yum - complete - transaction and repeat the upgrade to bump the non - native glibcs to the same version .  multilib is fun . 
-0.58	ss4 is now stable again .  For the record ,  if Yum  * really *  screws up a glibc update ,  repeat the upgrade excluding non - native glibc packages
-0.58	 @ worcscc yes ,  our buses are already useless enough without you morons screwing it up even more
-0.58	 @ Toots _ 90 Dudley tomorrow ,  traveling  :  /  was back in today for a client meeting though .  Looked and smelled rough .  .  .  LM customers do not wash

-0.58	 @ OllieRussell8  # potkettle

-0.58	CFX users :  ss4 is going to be offline for the next  ~ 40m .  Weve got a really unstable JRE thanks to RPM conking out mid - upgrade .  Fixing . 
-0.58	Is it not somewhat ironic that the PHP website is a solid example of how not to write PHP ?  Shield your eyes :  
-0.58	 @ OllieRussell8  @ BradGibbs _   @ LosSquare literally just left New St ,  next stop is Euston .  Nearly there mate  : p

-0.58	Thomas wasnt getting any love so he plundered a seat on mother

-0.58	Anyone with a brain would not rely on Windows shares for transferring exam / grading information .  Fucking insane . 
-0.58	Thanks to Stan at  @ pearsonvue for excellent product knowledge .  Hopefully one day theyll fix their godawful software . 
-0.58	 @ pearsonvues incompetence knows no bounds
