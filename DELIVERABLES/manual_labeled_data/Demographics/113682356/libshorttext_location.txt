43	 @ BradGibbs _  being observant as usual 
43	 @ Ajzahtiri  .  .  . until youre porting  & gt ; 100 , 000 lines to a new platform with 50 %  breakage  : D
43	 @ StewFisher Ive been royally shot down over this opinion today ,  not a single person in agreement .  Disappointing at best . 
43	Smart casual dress is ample for software developers .  Smart clothing should be reserved for meeting clients .   # unpopularopinion
43	Going to bed now .  Not impressed that this was necessary . 
43	 @ StewFisher  @ YouTube YT needed help to become viable .  Going off Apps though ,  even for free its not worth the hassle
43	The day Google builds a non - search web application that isnt buggy as shit will be the day the web finally wins out .  GCal is godawful . 
43	2 project go - lives in one night .  Satisfying way to start the new year despite the smouldering infrastructure  \ o / 
43	These bad boys finally arrived :  Sennheiser HD 558s .  So comfortable .  
43	 @ Ajzahtiri maybe it was to fast track you into using the language / runtime so you better understood the technical side ?  Not normal practice
43	 @ Ajzahtiri you learn to technical specs when youre working with indecisive clients ,  believe me .  They protect both sides from feature creep
43	Wireless charging ?  Psht 
43	 @ twbootstrap is ultimately still a toy until its JS is ported to more sane frameworks like YUI .  Another  @ twitter engineering trainwreck ! 
43	 .  .  . and the dog just knocked a massive glass bowl out of mums hands .  Make that  " pets in general "  .  .  . 
43	Just stepped on the cats paw because the blithering idiot stood right next to me trying to get food .  No sympathy .  Domestic cats are stupid . 
43	The polar bears getting jiggy with it 
43	 @ Ajzahtiri so coincidence ,  much strange ,  wow
43	Relating to themes in EastEnders episodes .  Pretty sure its only downhill from here . 
43	 @ Ajzahtiri hi azza
43	 @ NickColley yep ,  little respect for their users and even less for the security researchers that responsibly disclosed the issue .  Pitiful .  .  . 
43	HAH !  Snapchats  " abuse "  blog post neglects to tell users that they failed to address the flaw for weeks before the  " abuse "  took place  * sigh * 
43	The behemoth has been defeated .  Tomb Raider at 5760x1080 is unplayable at times even on normal graphics settings .  Those GTX 660 Tis must go ! 
43	Wow :  
43	 @ StewFisher no ,  that one is literally useless .  DrawCaptcha . toString (  )  shows that the value of the captcha is stored in the DOM . 
43	 @ StewFisher  @ callumacrae inspect the source ,  its utterly pointless
43	 @ StewFisher how quaint
43	 @ StewFisher  .  .  . but if the conservatives win the upper class will thrive and everyone else will starve
43	And this is exactly why sane people self host :  
43	 @ Ajzahtiri Probably EPOS or ecommerce then ,  bit of a difference lol
43	 @ Ajzahtiri games dev at the body shop .  .  .  !  ? 
43	 @ NickColley what I dont understand about browser sec is that DNT is considered paramount when most browsers still send the referer header
43	Ill give my soul to the person who can fool devscripts into updating this package to the newest upstream release :  
43	 @ LosSquare  @ OllieRussell8 I used to back when Laurent ,  Russ and Dave kept destroying the flat with coffee stains .  Im used to it now ,  tho ðŸ˜‡
43	So chucking thousands of requests at Gios async methods is unwise .  gvfsd - http crashes  _ lots _  .  Guess I ought to rate limit those .  .  .   * sigh * 
43	 @ rninty _  yessir ,  so good at handling multiple displays .  I live on workspaces ,  especially when Im using my laptop . 
43	 @ StewFisher would rather use Shell to be honest ,  so much pretty .  When  @ nvidia start shipping decent drivers well be sorted  :  ) 
43	 @ StewFisher Mint suffers from all the same issues and comes with the Cinnamon Challenge too .  Aint nobody got time fo dat
43	I love Ubuntu ,  but really !  ?  
43	Chapter 8 of Mirrors Edge .  All I can think is  " thank f *  *  *  thats nearly over "  .  Such a promising idea destroyed by terrible level design .  .  . 
43	 @ emily _ bradbury I only just woke up  : s
43	 # opsmas disaster averted :  domain transfers have all completed successfully .  I am definitely not doing this again tomorrow .  .  . 
43	 @ OllieRussell8 come buy me a drink if you take offence lad
43	Managed to play an entire 300 seconds worth of Mirrors Edge before raging about awful controls and haphazard directions .   \ o / 
43	 @ benjeh32 it has to be the yard of Jaffas or a Terrys chocolate orange  : 3
43	 @ Ajzahtiri times and places please ,  I need it at the moment lol
43	 @ Ajzahtiri sounds like you need to drink more
43	Love this :  
43	Great article on being a better developer / engineer :  
43	Went to see Frozen .  Not a bad film ,  but its definitely no Anchorman 2 . 
43	Hint :  check the Subsonic event log for issues like these .  Transcoder error output is recorded here . 
43	Subsonic web players not working since upgrade to 4 . 9 ?  Settings  -  & gt ;  Transcoders ,  replace occurrences of  - preset with  - vpre .  Yw  ;  ) 
43	 @ Ajzahtiri Google missed a trick by not making the messages app work like the people one .  It would be cool if all apps did messaging there
43	Why not just mute the affected audio ,   @ youtube ?  Youre destroying your platform .  .  .  
43	Ubisofts QA team are a prime example of why we cant have nice things .   @ ubisoftsupport AC3 would be amazing if it werent so bug ridden
43	 @ DavidMaitland  @ OllieRussell8  @ BradGibbs _  either is better than the current fluff though Dave
43	 @ BradGibbs _   @ OllieRussell8 just thought ,  there he resembles Brandon Flowers  ( Killers ) 
43	User interface design with Glade would probably be simple if I had the first clue how to stick together the widgets 
43	 @ benjeh32 does iOS have a battery usage indicator like the Android one ?  
43	Pretty sure Id be incapable of living without the wonder that is Syndol .  Migraines suck . 
43	 @ OllieRussell8  @ sophielliswhite jealous .  .  .  whered you guys go ? 
43	Never Let Me Go is a deeply disturbing film .  If thats the future of medicine ,  count me out . 
43	Hi  @ HannahCarrier1  # nofilter 
43	 .  @ OllieRussell8 
43	 @ bethhdavies _ x I had a touristy day around Westminster the other day ,  London is amazing  : D
43	 @ OllieRussell8  @ LosSquare  @ BradGibbs _   @ sophielliswhite fair play ,  full on pulled it off
43	 @ LosSquare in a mankini  @ OllieRussell8  @ BradGibbs _  
43	 @ tdmderrin lost his pint .  .  .   : o 
43	 @ StewFisher not worth it ,  they dont give two shits how poor our transport network is . 
43	Whittle have really redefined the term  " weapons grade cunts "  today .  Wish they had a Twitter handle so theyd see this . 
43	Hopefully this Secret Santa present tomorrow will be interpreted as a joke and not straight up misogyny .  Tough one this year .  .  .   : s
43	 @ gruber Maybe I need my eyes testing ,  then ,  because they sure dont look aesthetically appealing to me  :  / 
43	 @ gruber You are buying a machine that looks like a cheap plastic fucking bin ,  so I guess the display will be a pleasant change ? 
43	Gos encoding / xml documentation is absolutely fracking awful .  Wheres the example section ,  guys ? 
43	 @ OllieRussell8 no spoilers please !  Do want to go see it
43	Then . lys AI1EC plugin for WordPress is a fantastic example of why all WordPress developers should be burned at the stake .   # nope
43	 .  .  . then run yum - complete - transaction and repeat the upgrade to bump the non - native glibcs to the same version .  multilib is fun . 
43	ss4 is now stable again .  For the record ,  if Yum  * really *  screws up a glibc update ,  repeat the upgrade excluding non - native glibc packages
43	 @ worcscc yes ,  our buses are already useless enough without you morons screwing it up even more
43	 @ Toots _ 90 Dudley tomorrow ,  traveling  :  /  was back in today for a client meeting though .  Looked and smelled rough .  .  .  LM customers do not wash
43	Being locked out of home is a great start to being back in Stourport .  Its cold and a shower would not go down badly after traveling all day
43	 @ OllieRussell8  # potkettle
43	 @ OllieRussell8 olllld
43	133 unfinished transactions .  .  .   * cry * 
43	CFX users :  ss4 is going to be offline for the next  ~ 40m .  Weve got a really unstable JRE thanks to RPM conking out mid - upgrade .  Fixing . 
43	Is it not somewhat ironic that the PHP website is a solid example of how not to write PHP ?  Shield your eyes :  
43	 @ OllieRussell8  @ BradGibbs _   @ LosSquare literally just left New St ,  next stop is Euston .  Nearly there mate  : p
43	 @ BradGibbs _  sounds like something  @ LosSquare would do on his weekends in tribe lmao
43	 "  @ BradGibbs _  :  Weird people are out in full force today at the custard factory 
43	Not normally a Starbucks fan ,  but their gingerbread lattes are pretty nice  : 3
43	 @ II _ Rye  @ Ajzahtiri not officially ,  nope .  CM 11 nightlies with Gapps 4 . 4 . 1 work well  ( provided you run Dalvik and not ART ,  there be dragons ) 
43	CloudFlux folks :  if you need hosting support over the next 5 days ,  please email luke at cfx dot me .  Will not be reachable by phone ! 
43	 @ II _ Rye  @ Ajzahtiri Google Now integration with the launcher has to be up there :  so good for keeping track of your calendar
43	 " This could be the start of something huge ,  I feel it in my nutsack "   # misfits
43	Glad to see that the bastard Governor met his sticky end .  Such a sad episode  :  (   # thewalkingdead
43	Do not like the non - native tabs .  Does anyone at  @ twitter actually use the Android app !  ?  
43	New Twitter app would look incredible if they got rid of all those stupid buttons .  .  .  
43	This appeared last night ,  right as I was complaining about how bad the camera app was .  Huge improvement !  
43	Thomas wasnt getting any love so he plundered a seat on mother 
43	Definitely time for a holiday .  Apologies for looking nearly as bad as I feel today ,  people of Birmingham !  Good day though ,  awesome clients . 
43	 @ peterc the Nexus 5 beats any Samsung phone at the moment IMO ,  so good
43	 @ thetrainline so when our client sites are down because I wrote bad code  & amp ;  had no hot backup ,  I should tell them this ?  Its 2013 ,  cmon now . 
43	 @ RockstarGames making the  # pcmasterrace wait 6 months to play your games is a dick move
43	 @ BradGibbs _   : D
43	 @ AmaleaaBourne  @ KatherineeDodge totally spoilered it for me  :  ( 
43	Anyone with a brain would not rely on Windows shares for transferring exam / grading information .  Fucking insane . 
43	Thanks to Stan at  @ pearsonvue for excellent product knowledge .  Hopefully one day theyll fix their godawful software . 
43	 @ pearsonvues incompetence knows no bounds 
43	All Subsonic 4 . 9 . b2 instances that just crashed should now be back .  We had some issues with GC runs ;  should not repeat on us . 
43	 @ thetrainline is  " closed for maintenance "  ,  how cute .  Youre a fucking online retailer ,  start acting like one . 
43	Still loving the fantastic Dell XPS 15 .  If youre a Linux - using developer ,  this is the perfect machine for you  ;  -  ) 
43	 @ LosSquare  @ BradGibbs _   @ OllieRussell8 Im not even the one making it weird
43	 " All I want for Christmas is  @ OllieRussell8 "   -  -   @ BradGibbs _ 
43	Civ5 at 5760x1080 is one hell of a crashfest .  .  .  not sure if bad QA or just buggy drivers . 
43	 @ BradGibbs _   @ LosSquare  @ OllieRussell8 down ,  boy ! 
43	Ollies accustomed to doing this pose .  .  .   @ LosSquare  @ OllieRussell8  @ BradGibbs _ 
43	Just in case anyones having issues with their Subsonic instances not indexing new files correctly :  
43	Saints Row IV .  .  .  the highlight has to be climbing the towers to the tune of Song 2 by Blur .   @ magneatos
43	 @ StewFisher huzzah
43	Nah ,  Gnome 3 runs triple head like a champ .  I just think the KDE experience is clunky and unintuitive ,  hate the clutter
43	 @ G _ baylis walking through that place at night is terrifying
43	 @ StewFisher KDE !  ?  I expected better of you  :  ( 
43	 @ BradGibbs _  my bus today was remarkably on time .  The people at the bus stop looked like meth addicts ,  though
43	 @ harrysx  / me shudders at the thought of anyone using cPanel for anything at all
43	Alternate title for that last photo :  Androids camera app still fails fairly hard . 
43	Nawh somebody left her outside  : o 
43	 @ magneatos escaping Zinyaks ship to  " What is Love "  had me giggling so hard
43	 @ magneatos so many brilliant references in it too .  .  .  Im loving this game so much already .  Amazing  : D
43	Seriously thought the new iPad Air advert was advertising Bic pencils .  Not sure what that makes Apples marketing team . 
43	 @ magneatos YES I need this game ! 
43	 "  @ HannahCarrier1 :  just trust me "  nothing can possibly go wrong .  .  .   : p
43	That comments summarise Assassins Creed 3s problems really well :  
43	Removing Virtualmin like a baws :  keychecker  - m  |  grep Virtualmin ,  Inc .   |  sed s /  , Virtualmin ,  Inc .  /  / g  |  xargs sudo yum  - y erase
43	 @ OllieRussell8  @ UberFacts whoops .  .  . 
43	 .  @ npowerhq  @ rwe _ group  # fucknpower  # fuckrwe
43	 @ DavidMaitland  @ RussellEngland and heres me still struggling with the idea of investing in btc .  .  .  kicking myself now
43	 .  @ OVH how lovely of OVH to start talking to their clients again ,  were all oh so grateful . 
43	New DLNA support in Subsonic is cool ,  but Id like an option for indexing content by folders  ( e . g .  TV Shows ,  Music ,  Movies ) 
43	One for  @ OllieRussell8  @ KoenKlaren  @ cyrilmengin .  .  .  
43	Google Drive is a fucking horrible product . 
43	CloudFlux users :  Subsonic servers will be undergoing routine maintenance this Saturday for 30 minutes ,  starting at 11AM GMT  # hugyoursysadmin
43	The new nvidia game ready drivers are .  .  .  Interesting .  
43	Great catching up with  @ thomaswbell88 tonight !  Please thank Hannah again for the lift  :  ) 
43	I love the points about trust and skepticism :  
43	Porter Robinson  -  Spitfire .  I have not heard this album in ages ,  amazing . 
43	 @ arronhunt  -  -  every client ,  ever ? 
43	 @ NickColley  @ Ajzahtiri aww  ;  -  ) 
43	 @ NickColley  @ Ajzahtiri current term is what puts food on the table ,  preparing for the future yields longevity .  You need both  ;  -  ) 
43	 @ NickColley  @ Ajzahtiri in a commercial environment ,  theyre a deciding factor .  .  .  limited reach and lower ROI .  Easier to just target Windoze
43	 @ NickColley  @ Ajzahtiri  .  .  . on certain browser / hardware combos .  Try Chromium / Firefox on Intel / Nvidia hardware .  Results vary wildly . 
43	 @ NickColley  @ Ajzahtiri there are serious performance implications of a browser vs native client .  Its an incredible feat ,  but its not ready
43	 @ NickColley  @ Ajzahtiri WebGL has a loooong way to go yet before thats true  ;  -  ) 
43	 @ koenklaren  @ OllieRussell8 you really werent missing much lol
43	 @ OllieRussell8 should have seen him vacuuming out the cupboard .  .  .
