1	 @ rauhlingvamps Hope you have loads of fun .  .  .  .  .  . as Im sure you will  : D
1	So annoying ,  looks like  # Parkland isnt being released at my local cinema .  Will I ever get to see  # tomwelling on the big screen ?   :  ( 
1	 @ Nobody _ 5p3c14L thats where I was born and raised ,  would be fantastic if he was connected to my neck of the woods !   : D
1	 @ rauhlingpigs Hehehehe !  I use them ALL the time  : D !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
1	 @ rauhlingpigs Yes .  They go back ,  so you gain an extra hours sleep  : D
1	 @ Alleswelling something to do with the fact TW was spotted at The Magic Castle over the wknd instead ,  guess someone was telling stories .  .  . 
1	 @ Alleswelling I saw tweets suggesting someone saw him using a gym in Memphis ,  but oddly enough those tweets have disappeared ,  might have .  .  . 
1	 @ joleeB74 Thanks for sharing that pic .  Nice to see one of them both together . 
1	 @ lovedearest I really cant wait to see .  . Does this mean youll be opening it back up ?  If so ,  thats brilliant and Thank you !   : D
1	 @ rauhlingpigs That wont be a problem ,  have watched and been to many musicals in London over the years ,  I pick them up quick enough  : D
1	 @ rauhlingpigs The Hugh Jackman one ?  Ive recorded it ,  just need the time to watch ,  all full 2 hours of it  : D
1	 @ lovedearest Thank you for the drool worthy pics  ;  ) 
1	 @ lovedearest I am sad to hear this too ,  its a shame ,  really doesnt take much to add credit .  Getting withdrawals from your gallery already
1	Seriously ?  Now the UK has to wait an additional 2 weeks for  # Parkland ,  gonna take me forever to see  # TomWelling gracing the big screen now
1	 @ rauhlingpigs Hahaha ,  thats something I do a lot too !   : D
1	 # FF to you too ,  hope you have a great wknd  @ hatie123  @ AppleEl  @ PiloteXYZ  @ Tommygirl40  @ Samaritan93  @ Barb1808  @ TooBadDiane  @ typertist
1	 @ KayrenPW  @ ParklandFilm  @ ParklandUK  @ nevarhunnew  @ FruitPunch10  @ Loublou1611  @ Fyeahtomwelling Thanks for the  # FF ,  have a great wknd too  : D
1	 @ mabelenda  @ MoviewebVideos I am the same ,  watched it so many times already .  Really need more Tom clips ! 
1	 @ tariel22 I really cant wait ,  such great things being said ,  I have another month to go before I see it ,  Im getting impatient ! 
1	 @ KayrenPW  @ ParklandFilm  @ ParklandUK  @ nevarhunnew  @ FruitPunch10  @ VickiLVCM  @ Loublou1611  @ Fyeahtomwelling Thanks ,  hope yours is great too
1	About to tuck into a tasty Jamie Oliver meal !  Yummy !   (  @  Union Jacks )  
1	Looking forward to spending the day in London with the girls !   : D  (  @  Hatfield Railway Station  ( HAT )  )  
1	 @ lovedearest thank you for the new goodies .  These pics just keep on coming !   : D
1	 @ AppleEl I know the feeling ,   # Smallville was the only show to do this to me too .  Thank goodness for DVDs .  But also miss all the hype  :  ( 
1	 @ lovedearest Wow ,  more ?   Cant wait .  Chances of getting off the chair and getting things done today are zero then ,  lol .   : D
1	 @ rauhlingpigs getting into practice for school maybe ?  lol
1	 @ ExclusiveEMG Absolutely ,  cant wait !   : D
1	 @ lovedearest Thanks for all the  # TomWelling goodies .   Cant believe I spent a whole day sitting at the computer ,  drooling !  What a treat !   : D
1	 @ KayrenPW  @ ParklandFilm  @ ParklandUK  @ nevarhunnew  @ FruitPunch10  @ VickiLVCM  @ Loublou1611  @ Fyeahtomwelling Thx ,  hope yours is going great too
1	 @ Oaky93 same here .  I was pleasantly surprised and was happy to see so many be a part of the movie . 
1	 @ mabelenda yes ,  even if until then there is no work ,  please at least let there be golf !  Ill take anything right now !  Lol
1	 @ mabelenda I am living in hope of that happening !  Lol
1	 @ Oaky93 which really pleased me .  Was like they were acknowledging Smallvilles version ,  storylines and work  : D
1	 @ Oaky93 exactly .  What Smallville did was the best by far and I even felt that MoS was taking some of their versions / story for its reboot
1	 @ Oaky93 see the glasses disguise as a great one from the older versions ,  so playing it this way was so much better in my eyes
1	 @ Oaky93 I was excited for the change .  I love superman but it did need rebooting / modernising .  Even loved the Lois story / angle ,  I never did .  .  . 
1	 @ Oaky93 same here .  Really loved it .  Not really anything to dislike ,  just the absence of the theme tune for me .  How about you ? 
1	 @ Oaky93 I did the same thing .  Avoided all trailers and TV spots so it would all be new and fresh to me  : D
1	 @ mabelenda I agree .  I know he likes to be in the shadows but a little pr would seriously help his career opportunities and us fans too  ; P
1	 @ mabelenda most definitely !   : D Surely its time for Tom to make another movie / TV announcement ,  weve been patient and need some excitement
1	 @ mabelenda absolutely ,  hes totally addictive .  Cant imagine what I will be like when his movies get released !   : D
1	 @ mabelenda so Im not the only one that does that then ?  Lol some days I feel like a lurker ! 
1	 @ Oaky93 same here .  I wondered if I set my goals too high for this one but glad it exceeded it
1	can hardly keep my eyes open ,  guess I should call it a night now .  If I didnt already have plans tomorrow I would go watch  # ManOfSteel again
1	I only have one gripe with the  # ManOfSteel movie ,  I missed the iconic theme tune and really wished they had done a version of it  :  ( 
1	 @ mbethmason whats not to like ?  He was the best Clark in my eyes .  Yes ,  I do already follow you  : D
1	 @ NathalieWelling I agree about  # tomwelling for sure ,  he is my absolute No1 favourite ,  but after seeing  # MoS I have to put Henry in 2nd place
1	 @ mbethmason yes ,  same here .  All Superman related things for me are always compared to Smallville and  # TomWelling ,  my most favourite of all
1	 @ mbethmason to have just done it the same as before .  As a  # Smallville fan I feel it was like recognition to the 10 yrs build up they created
1	 @ mbethmason and the fact they went with those ideas to help form a different type of Superman story made me happy ,  would have been easy .  .  . 
1	 @ mbethmason true ,  but I didnt mind .  But I loved the scenes they used ,  seems they wanted smallvilles background stories as theirs too
1	I am hoping for a  # ManOfSteel sequel .  Hope its being considered ,  now I really want to rewatch  # TomWelling in Smallville ,  my fav Superman
1	 @ DerfelMacklin yes ,  I liked that angle and how they did that too
1	 @ DerfelMacklin I was surprised to see so many of them in the movie ,  I loved it ,  that they all wanted to be a part of it too  : D
1	made me happy ,  wonder if  # smallville was inspiration for a few scenes ?  Certainly seemed like it had influence from it ,  some similarities
1	Loved  # ManOfSteel definitely going to see it again ,  spotted some actors from  # Smallville  & amp ;  even a few scenes were very Smallville - ish too  : D
1	Patiently waiting for the film to start Chloe  (  @  Odeon for Man of Steel 3D )  
1	Think I need to avoid twitter ,  seeing loads of people are now seeing  # manofsteel and I have tickets for tomorrow .  Must not see spoilers ! 
1	Im addicted to the Whats the Saying app !  Try it ,  its free :  
1	Is patiently awaiting new piccies of TW .  Hope he is definitely golfing and ready to delight us all with smiley pictures !   : D
1	yay ,  weekend is finally here and I intend to do absolutely nothing ,  need a quiet restful weekend with the TV and Kindle  : D
1	 @ mabelenda so true .  Ive been away for a few days and cant believe all the tweets on the timeline .  Just going to read the nice tweets !   : D
1	my twitter is playing up ,  cant search things ,  cant even access my own profile page  :  ( 
1	Nearly home !   : D  (  @  London Kings Cross Railway Station  ( KGX )   -   @ nationalrailenq w /  4 others )  
1	Journey part one completed .  Now for the next part while enjoying my caffe Nero goodies !   (  @  Platform 9 )  
1	Too early for this travelling on a Saturday !  Lol  (  @  Hatfield Railway Station  ( HAT )   -   @ nationalrailenq )  
1	I pre - booked my  # ManOfSteel tickets today .  Cant wait to go see this .  Not long to go now  : D
1	 @ NathalieWelling yes ,  definitely  : D
1	 @ Vicki _ Law its a pain when those games say you have to do something like that ,  its not really necessary to the game play at all
1	 @ NathalieWelling I totally understand ,  its the Welling effect !  lol
1	 @ NathalieWelling Or better yet ,  just wish he was IN your house !  lol
1	 @ Vicki _ Law tut tut ,  spamming the place now I see .  lol
1	Sooo bored .  Think I need new TV shows to watch ,  everything is finishing .  .  . or .  .  . I could just start another Smallville re - watch ,  again !   : D
1	 @ NathalieWelling have definitely done this many times ,  with many different photos .  lol
1	Not sure what happened to my motivation this morning .  So going to be late for everything today now  :  (  busy day ahead ! 
1	 @ Vicki _ Law If not then I have to seriously think if I want to spend that much !   :  ( 
1	 @ Vicki _ Law Checked them on phone earlier and they were over Â£50 ,  will look online shortly to see if I can get anything cheaper . 
1	 @ Vicki _ Law Stalking ?  Me ,  thats not in my nature .  .  . lurking on the other hand is a possibility !  lol
1	 # FF  @ hatie123  @ PiloteXYZ  @ NathalieWelling  @ AppleEl  @ Igurashi  @ mabelenda  @ mbethmason  @ tomwfans  @ Vicki _ Law Have a great Friday ! 
1	 @ evebarros Shirt ?  What shirt ?  That shirt can stay lost for all I care .   : D  The view is perfect from here !  lol
1	A few busy days away from twitter and I see I didnt miss any news or pictures ,  someone has those ninja skills mastered  # tomwelling
1	 @ mabelenda I miss all that hair too !  Though I didnt mind the short cut he had where he grew it on top in those pics from LA . 
1	Five minutes to go until the Arrow finale in the UK ,  been trying to avoid other peoples comments  & amp ;  spoilers for days ,  cant wait ! 
1	What a grey start to the morning ,  hope theres some Tom news / sightings to brighten it up a little today  :  ) 
1	 @ NathalieWelling  @ tomwfans  @ VickiLVCM Exactly ,  I agree . 
1	 @ tomwfans  @ NathalieWelling  @ VickiLVCM I would hope Tom wouldnt except something like this on morals and self respect . 
1	 @ NathalieWelling  @ tomwfans  @ VickiLVCM Yes ,  thats the same for the books too ,  some love it obsessively ,  while others dont see the hype ,  lol
1	 @ tomwfans  @ NathalieWelling  @ VickiLVCM Yes ,  luckily for us ,  Tom is not in this business for the fame ,  he is looking to be taken seriously
1	 @ NathalieWelling  @ tomwfans  @ VickiLVCM Exactly ,  thats my view too .  For an actor ,  your not going to be taken seriously if you do it ,  I feel . 
1	 @ tomwfans  @ mbethmason  @ VickiLVCM  @ laracreuchi I guess every fan would feel mixed about their fav actor taking on the role .   : D
1	 @ NathalieWelling Ive read them  & amp ;  hope he never goes near the film ,  its tacky  & amp ;  degrading ,  hes making good choices so far ,  no need for it ! 
1	 @ tomwfans Not sure I want him to ,  I think its kind of tacky and degrading .  Think Tom is too gentlemanly to play that sort of role
1	Not enjoying a very rank cup of tea  :  (   (  @  Esquires Coffee House )  
1	Just watched Iron Man 3 .  Fantastic ,  my favourite one I think !   (  @  Odeon )
