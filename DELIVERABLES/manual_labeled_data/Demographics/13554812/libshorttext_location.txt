17	 @ sinasamavati thanks ,  I was referring more to a boilerplate  ( like a gem structure in the ruby world )  ,  I think I got it though . 
17	Looking for small  # erlang OTP codebases with tests to read ,  any suggestions ?  Please RT . 
17	 @ iainbeeston I don’t understand Game Center at all . 
17	 # erlang learning the language ,  miss TDD .  Is rebar  +  eunit tests in the same file the standard for simple cases ?  Don’t need ct _ run for now . 
17	 @ jeresig mimosa  ( at least in italian )  is also a yellow flower ,  as yellow as the drink . 
17	 @ Malarkey “making it pretty” is invaluable indeed ,  I can’t count the times that I wished I had that skill . 
17	 @ cassarani sure ,  I’ll be there ! 
17	Not getting too excited but SHERLOCK . 
17	 @ mrleemachin That’s quite the analogy  :  - D
17	In my next life I want to be Mr .  Awesome from Chuck . 
17	And yes ,  I didn’t mention Javascript on purpose . 
17	Erlang and Elixir are a rabbit hole ,  and it’s extremely fun ,  hadn’t this fun with a programming language ( s )  since I learned Ruby . 
17	Got some home stuff to do today ,  but after that I’ll play with  @ rethinkdb and the  @ Tate collection data . 
17	…aaaaand I’m back .  Feel free to tell me you all missed me ,  I certainly did ! 
17	 @ jumpzero grazio ,  sono appena atterrato !

17	 @ SophTwits not surprised ,  AFAIK places run out pretty fast ! 
17	 @ danbee I tunneled in the end ! 
17	 @ SophTwits Happy new year to you as well !  Did you sign up for the 8th ? 
17	 @ danbenjamin Can vouch for that from the Uk  -  streaming Netflix on the Roku 3 HD is rock solid at 1080p . 
17	 @ elixirdose I’ve updated the benchmarks with a new tail recursion example and some README tweaks .  
17	 @ elixirdose thanks !  Good job  :  -  )  I do have to revise the upcase benchmark though . 
17	 @ tanjapislar Fingers crossed ,  wouldnt wanna resolve to alternative means ! 
17	So tonight there’s Sherlock and I cannot stream it from Italy…

17	 @ mrleemachin have you tried faking the user agent ? 
17	 @ cassarani Hi can you send me your email ?  Got an article I’d like your input on . 
17	 @ iainbeeston It’s a HP indeed .  It now works ,  but as always not a pleasant ,  beginner - ready experience . 
17	And apparently ,  to tell a wireless printer to join a wireless network you have to plug it into a computer and do it from there . 
17	200 MB for a printer software .  FFS is the word . 
17	 @ tjmwy spot on ! 
17	Setting up a printer ,  thanks for your invaluable moral support . 
17	 @ SophTwits well that makes a lot of sense !  Have a good Christmas !
