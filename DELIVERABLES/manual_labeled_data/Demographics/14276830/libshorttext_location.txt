17	 @ DarrellMozingo Might be worth looking into something like Typemock .  Im recommending it for another team here that has no tests . 
17	 @ lautzenheiser If its an app that ppl depend on and is actively worked on ,  .  its worth the time for tests .   
17	Whats the best way to let clients plug their own IoC container into your framework ?  CSL ?  Custom interface ?  Hard code my pref  &  screw um ?   :  )

17	 @ patrik _ hagne Thanks for the help !  Nice clean take on mocking you guys have there  -  going to use it on a new project . 
17	 @ patrik _ hagne Sweet ,  thanks for the tip !   Any way to filter if x . TheMemberYouWantCallsFor (  )  takes an argument ?

17	Color scheme after moving to VS 2010 and R #  5 . 1 are making my eyes bleed .  Ouch . 
17	 @ ferventcoder A monkey wrench and a good book arent that expensive though  :  ) 
17	Upgrading to VS 2010 /  . NET 4 ,   MVC 3 beta  ( straight from MVC 1 )  ,  and latest Spark build all at the same time .  This should be fun .  .  . 
17	Free TekPub this Friday !

17	 @ JustinEtheredge Im seeing the speed issues with Google Apps recently too .  Getting annoying . 
17	 @ JimHolmes I know holding in the shift key messes it up  ( at least in the version Im running )  .
