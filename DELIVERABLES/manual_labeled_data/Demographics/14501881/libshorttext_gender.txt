-1	Just checked eBay  ( and other sites )  ,  my Black iPhone 4 16gb  ( unlocked )  could go for £200 - £250 .  Crazy !  I was willing to give it away . 
-1	 @ briski got sick of windows around the time windows 8 got released .  Ill take the fanboy label now  : D
-1	 @ PogoMix Lovin AyeAye .  When will the album containing it be out ?

-1	 @ barrymcgee This sounds like a plan .  Sometime next week maybe .  Im a walking corpse today .  Sleep is a must . 
-1	 @ KevCoady That would make complete sense ,  but a bit unlike Apple to neglect the little things .

-1	 @ NeilCrosby Apple TV  & gt ;  Trailers ,  shows review scores under the films .  Cockneys Vs .  Zombies :  69 %  ,  Elysium :  68 %  ,  World War Z :  68 %  . 
-1	You know a review system is broken when Cockneys Vs .  Zombies has a higher review than World War Z and Elysium . 
-1	If you were disappointed by World Was Z having no blood in it ,  you need to watch the Unrated version .  Holy moly is their ever blood in that .
