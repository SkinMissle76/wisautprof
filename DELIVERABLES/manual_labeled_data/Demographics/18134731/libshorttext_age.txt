-0.48	 @ wfaler Haha ,  yeah .  Its strange though as the 360 experience was substantially better .  Youd think theyd have it figured out by now .  .  . 
-0.48	Its quite alarming just how unfinished the Xbox One feels .  I really hope theyre planning to continually update the software over time . 
-0.48	 @ xboxuk Are there plans to address the overscan problem on older TVs ?  I may have to buy a new TV just to get things to work properly .   :  ( 
-0.48	 @ computionist I think its fairly safe to ignore any article written by an investor in the company / technology . 
-0.48	 @ BenNunney There are some caveats :  no tethering ,  25GB / month max ,  higher latencies for VPNs / streaming etc .  but its still a damn good deal . 
-0.48	 @ AmazonHelp Thanks . 
-0.48	 @ AmazonHelp OK ,  but how can I guarantee it arrives on  * a *  weekend .  I dont care if its tomorrow or next weekend ,  so long as its a weekend . 
-0.48	 @ AmazonHelp Is there a way to guarantee delivery on a weekend  ( residential address )  in the UK ?   " Next Day "  currently estimates 6th Jan .  .  . 
-0.48	 @ jeromatron  @ jairamc Between 1883 and 1885 ,  I imagine that was a very long commute ! 
-0.48	 @ ronanklyne That makes more sense .  I think the  " lazy language that was never called  [ for ]  "  is something I missed due to tiredness . 
-0.48	Did I miss the joke in todays XKCD ?  It just seemed like humourless criticism to me . 
-0.48	 @ suffrajess Took me a minute to realise you were talking about Into Darkness ;  thats pretty bad .  I imagine Roddenberry wouldnt approve .

-0.48	 @ wfaler Were you at the Haskell meet up tonight ? 
-0.48	Really enjoyed the  # haskell London meet up tonight .  SPJ did an excellent job of making a tough subject very approachable . 
-0.48	 @ aphyr Thats really cool ,  where did you read that ? 
-0.48	 @ zcourts lol ,  seriously ? 
-0.48	Really though ,  the fact that  " selfie "  beat  " obedience "  to word - of - the - year is a pretty good sign .

-0.48	 @ jwirde Good spot .  Would accept a Pull Request if you have it  :  ) 
-0.48	 @ dibblego Ignorance favours subjective definitions . 
-0.48	 @ kjozsa Something about Mockito  +  Scala 2 . 9  +  Specs2 makes it behave unpredictably and infuriatingly .

-0.48	Mockito ;  for when youd rather test your patience than your code . 
-0.48	 @ RobAshton Oh I see ,  that is  ( slightly )  more acceptable .

-0.48	 @ jericevans It strikes me that  " Cloud "  usually means one of :  SaSS ,  PaSS or IaSS ;  dependent on the vendor ,  product and / or audience . 
-0.48	 @ jessitron I believe thats normal .  Nearly all of the JVM threads seem to sit in RUNNABLE constantly ,  for any process . 
-0.48	 @ jessitron I assume you mean  " RUNNABLE "  ?  Have you tried  " jstack  - m "  to get a stack trace of the JVMs native frames ? 
-0.48	Fate is not on my side today . 
-0.48	 @ etorreborre Thanks ,  Ill give that a go .  Really appreciate the advice . 
-0.48	 @ nik More height to the monolith . 
-0.48	 @ kellabyte Are unbounded queues a good idea for anything ? 
-0.48	 @ etorreborre That explains a lot .  Googling suggested that support was in 1 . 9 ;  still on Scala 2 . 9 . 3 ,  so I guess Im SOL  :  ( 
-0.48	 @ etorreborre Uhh ,  I meant :  def f [ A ]  ( a :   =  & gt ;  A )  :  A
-0.48	 @ etorreborre Politicians ,  and the voting public in general ,  have a tendency not to believe anything they cant see / feel .  Will be our undoing
-0.48	 @ etorreborre I think my problem stems from a by - name parameter .  In this case ,  def f [ A ]  :  A  =  & gt ;  A
-0.48	 @ OpheliaDagger  @ Chris _ Telford Remember to take my advice with a pinch of salt  ( figuratively )  .  I could be making it all up . 
-0.48	 @ OpheliaDagger Similarly ,  your brain has no nerve endings ;  headaches are pain in the lining of your skull . 
-0.48	 @ OpheliaDagger I believe  " eye - pain "  is actually pain in the eye socket ,  though Im not a doctor . 
-0.48	Y U NO :  mock . f ( any )  answers identity
-0.48	Shout - out to the  # mockito support in  # specs2 being confusing as fuck . 
-0.48	 @ OpheliaDagger Surely itd just be easier to change your password ? 
-0.48	 @ rontana  @ NetworkString Do you guys have a way of measuring the Scoville rating so you know how hot you managed to grow it ? 
-0.48	 @ timmorgan Hardly surprising ;  demand has been rising steadily and no new capacity has been added in decades .

-0.48	 @ sthulb Im not either ,  but I believe the sweet - spot is for the annual deficit to be the same as the annual growth . 
-0.48	 @ sthulb I believe thats the motivation for the  " austerity "  measures across Europe .  Cutting deficits to a more reasonable level . 
-0.48	 @ sthulb Supposedly ,  a budget defecit is good for a growing economy .  But that argument ignores the inevitable :  the music will always stop . 
-0.48	 @ sthulb Whats really quite remarkable is ,  unlike the subprime crash ,  this has been totally manufactured and is easily stopped .  Amazing . 
-0.48	 @ sthulb BTW ,  I love that HaveYourSay is only available on articles that maximise the opportunity for commenters to showcase their ignorance . 
-0.48	 @ sthulb As far as I can tell ,  it looks like the UK / Europe wont be hit as hard as most . 
-0.48	So it seems the single largest holder of US debt is the  " Social Security Trust Fund "  .  The US state pension system . 
-0.48	 @ sthulb I imagine itll really suck for anyone holding US national debt  ( China ,  Japan )  and anyone holding a lot of US currency .

-0.48	Given that the 100 Pa tubes would be the equivalent to the atmosphere at 159 , 000ft ,  oxygen masks probably wouldnt help in emergencies . 
-0.48	By my calculations ,  the pressure differential for Hyperloop pods / tubes would be 50 times greater than an aircraft at 35 , 000ft . 
-0.48	Outward - opening gull - wing doors with a pressure differential equivalent to 100 times what you get at 50 , 000ft sounds problematic to me .
