-1	 @ danrough  @ mwjacks0n Gen Kim is the father of DevOps  ( along with Patrick Debois )  so I think thats a bit of a disservice
-1	 @ danrough  @ mwjacks0n This post from Gene Kim on The Principles underpinning DevOps is good 
-1	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough who says ?  In my experience DevOps is more cultural than tech  ( just like Agile )  . 
-1	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough in fact devops has even fewer tangible points of ref .   ( e . g .  agile manifesto )  so more likely to get abused . 
-1	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough devops no more technical than agile .  Already being diluted and name checked by higher echelons .
