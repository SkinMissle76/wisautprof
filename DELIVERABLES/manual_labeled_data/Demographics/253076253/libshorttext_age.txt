-0.34	 @ fakebaldur the tech savvy are still the minority ,  it takes people a long time to learn the finer elements ,  even if they seem comfortable
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur simple enough compared to the complexity of creating ebooks ,  but ask a random sample of users if they know how to do this…
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur problem is that all this stuff gets turned on automatically and not everyone has the patience to figure out how to disable it
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur distraction doesnt make them inferior ,  but distraction is a factor when you have notifications and so on popping up
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur in that case we agree ,  I dont think reading in one way is inferior to another ,  each method has proven its worth in some way

-0.34	Morpurgo has published so many books that theres an entire Amazon chart devoted to him 
-0.34	 @ crash _  _   @ NickRuffilo because it takes hours of trial and error and is fragile ,  providing a proof of concept rather than a working solution
-0.34	 @ crash _  _   @ NickRuffilo you might well be right I tried out a lot of this stuff in first versions of iBooks and havent touched since  .  .  . 
-0.34	 @ andreasmeininge  .  .  .  you might want to look into remote access of Mac rather than router hard drive

-0.34	 @ bbirdiman  @ jochmann  @ fakebaldur my observation was that Apple in iOS 7 has extended the ways to get from various formats into core text
-0.34	 @ bbirdiman  @ jochmann  @ fakebaldur RTF is not the future of ebooks for Apple and this was never my intention to declare ,  my intention was…
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman but iBooks is an app ,  and like any other must have the ground prepared by the OS
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman I can see the frustration but iOS7 is a clear signal that text and layouts are a priority for Apple from here forward
-0.34	 @ jochmann  @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman if the project is a success the  ebooks will be able to mix and match all sorts of data types and content . 
-0.34	 @ jochmann  @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman in so doing is moving away from the structure of simply rendering web pages in ebooks
-0.34	 @ jochmann  @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman indeed ,  iOS 7 makes huge leaps in extending the depths at which HTML ,  JS and RTF can be used in apps and .  .  . 
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman this is Apple and they are unlikely to change ,  because missing out on small rewards they shoot for the big ones
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman this is unlikely to happen ,  so they focus on developing their exclusive edge ,  but neglect to wholly serve the present
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman for iBooks to compete in regular ebooks ,  Apple would need to make eink readers and release iBooks on every platform .  . 
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman there are areas like these along with EPUB3 and JS where they blow others out of the water ,  nothing is perfect
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman I agree with every one of your statements ,  but compare how column layouts and lists paginate across multiple pages .  .  . 
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman they are chasing bigger game because Amazon is shooting everything else and they need to play to their strengths
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur  @ bbirdiman Apple is an also ran in the area of regular ebooks ,  but no company has yet nailed complex ebooks .  .  . 
-0.34	 @ bbirdiman  @ fakebaldur exactly right ,  Apple is preparing for future issues ,  it makes them who they are ,  which I agree is in part frustrating
-0.34	 @ penllawen  @ craiggrannell in which case Id advise against holding your breath ,  it would be a health hazard
-0.34	 " but couldn’t be looked to as a cure - all for the challenges of multi - platformdevelopment .  "  
-0.34	 " Most respondents were neutral on HTML5 ,  agreeing that it hadits place for certain kinds of apps …  " 
-0.34	 @ penllawen  @ craiggrannell no it doesnt ,  not as long as those people would actually buy such a thing and are not projecting a need on others
-0.34	 @ PenLlawen  @ CraigGrannell I dont know how often that scenario occurs ,  but it would seem not enough for Apple to worry about at the moment
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur CSS and HTML are not the code nirvana you think they are ,  get over it
-0.34	 @ mcelhearn  @ CraigGrannell in the end ,  few people need a Mac Pro ,  and those who do will not be surprised by the prices Apple is charging
-0.34	RT The entire 13 books of Lemony Snicket :  A Series of Unfortunate Events are 99p each today !  Grab them NOW :  
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur its a tough position between knowing loading lag on big images is less than optimal and being flexible enough for real world
-0.34	 @ fakebaldur my guess is that Apple is trying to parse as much as possible into core level objects to accelerate loading ,  hence the rules
-0.34	Dear tech journalists the MacPro is not a consumer level computer ,  so get over the price and think about how much of that is VAT .

-0.34	If anything restrictions on grammar schools will protect those in the upper classes from the social mobility of the those lower than them
-0.34	… you get into grammar school based on merit but private school based on money  -  wheres the greater inequality ? 
-0.34	If grammar schools are deemed to be bad because they prevent social mobility then surely same could be said of private education as well
