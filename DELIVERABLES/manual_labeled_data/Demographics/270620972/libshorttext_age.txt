-0.38	 @ LDNBikeKitchen its best when  @ MarketCoffeeCo is there on weekends . 
-0.38	 @ abestanway thinking out loud  :  )  the breath of the histogram would also need to be considered  ( thinking std deviation )  to model the data
-0.38	 @ abestanway Makes sense .  A big enough spike would give you the same mean on a histogram ,  wouldnt it ? 
-0.38	 @ gregsochanik congratulations ! 
-0.38	 @ rcarmo  @ smpb  @ Codebits looking good !  we got some ad hoc stuff for rabbitmq and then screens graphite ,  skyline ,  zabbix .  .  . 
-0.38	 @ smpb we use it to show our graphite screens  ( stuck to a monitor on the wall )  but the screens are memory hogs
-0.38	 @ smpb shiny ,  what are you doing with it . 
-0.38	 @ smpb free rasps for codebits ? 
-0.38	 @ abestanway what if the spike comes down ,  how steep or long has the spike to be… 10minutes ?  depends on service ,  but how to optimise .  . 
-0.38	 @ mwjacks0n that’s what I was told as well  -  was waiting to find a time to book it . 
-0.38	 @ Podgeypoos79 what did you use for it ?

-0.38	 @ MatStace  @ henryoswald  @ hibri Im guessing the company doesnt have automation or devs dont touch it . 
-0.38	 @ henryoswald  @ MatStace  @ hibri curious :  why didnt you spend that time adding a DNS ? 
-0.38	 @ henryoswald  @ MatStace  @ hibri thats a lazier DNS sort of .  .  . not close to the problems they will have doing it manually
