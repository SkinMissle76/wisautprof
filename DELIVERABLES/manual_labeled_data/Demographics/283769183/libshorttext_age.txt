-0.52	Going form the only developer to being surrounded by developers is awesome .  Great to find a company approaching development properly
-0.52	 @ Sacrilicious no .  Doing it outside of boxen works perfectly .  Ended up using curl instead
-0.52	 @ zachinglis It probably works out cheaper to just buy the music . 
-0.52	 @ freakyDaz  * boxen
-0.52	Why boxes !  WHYYY !  !  brew install wget  : D boxen equivalent fails  :  ( 
-0.52	 @ emmaicbrown No butterfield for you ! 
-0.52	Getting my old windows phone out .  Giving the fiancée my galaxy s2 as her phone is hideously slow .

-0.52	My first use of rspec example groups to help keep my specs maintainable .  Lov
-0.52	 @ GoCardless I understand that but currently I couldn’t financial afford the ‘other options’  :  (  funding things personally currently . 
-0.52	Well this doesn’t look great for heroku .  Call me naive but it puts me off using them 
-0.52	I should really look into using AWS elastic beanstalk .  I think my next project might end up there . 
-0.52	Why does UK have such rubbish / expensive payment systems .  I like  @ GoCardless but until I can allow payments from the US it is hard to justify
-0.52	 @ idiot PLEASSSEEEE !  !  ! 
-0.52	 @ nimbushosting Do you know what caused the downtime earlier this morning ? 
-0.52	For instance can any doctor with enough practice become a surgeon or are you naturally drawn to the job and you skills build around that ? 
-0.52	Film was okay .  It did spawn an interesting conversation about people who are born to do a job . 
-0.52	Going to go see flight tonight .  Or thats the plan at least . 
-0.52	 @ nimbushosting All appears to be working so no downtime as of yet .

-0.52	 @ xoxjordanaxox Good luck  : D
-0.52	 @ xoxjordanaxox Yeah most churches have choirs .  It might not be as good but I bet it costs considerably less
-0.52	 @ xoxjordanaxox ouch a grand lol .  Have you been to surrounding churches and asked if they know any ? 
-0.52	 @ xoxjordanaxox have you not found one ?  or is it just the cost of them ? 
-0.52	Started moving my DNS records over to  @ nimbushosting .  Hopefully it all goes smoothly . 
-0.52	 @ samUK Cheers .  I hadn’t thought about that .  4x4 perfection right there . 
-0.52	 @ samUK you should really go with an actual insurance company as opposed to an African mammal… Just sayin’
-0.52	My mortgage has been accepted !  Okay now just need the solicitors to speed up and get me a moving date .   # bloodyexcited  # verypoor
-0.52	 @ thomasfuchs My host only ever recommends centos but it is a massive pain to install latest libraries on . 
-0.52	 @ sazzy I’ve always had this issue .  It has to be a hardcoded restriction within chrome . 
-0.52	 @ dionnewilsher Have fun . 
-0.52	Listening to  @ ShopTalkShow as I unwind for the day . 
-0.52	Yet another rails security vulnerability .  I love rails and all but it has made me look towards other solutions recently . 
-0.52	Been waiting to see the doctor for absolutely ages now . 
-0.52	Had a nice weekend with the fiancée .  Hoping to hear more news on our future house next week . 
-0.52	Nice stint at the gym .  Going to relax in front of the TV with a film on .  Im well on my way to my target weight .

-0.52	 @ nimbushosting Your phones are always down haha
-0.52	I still find  @ trello is my go - to todo manager for any of my personal projects .  The quickest to use by a mile . 
-0.52	I should start using arel more for complex queries in Rails .  I must avoid SQL at ALL costs ! 
-0.52	I’m genuinely loving life currently .  Beautiful fiancée and an exciting job .  Bring on the future !  So I can kick its arse too ! 
-0.52	 @ peterjlambert Congratulations ! 
-0.52	So easy !  Does your project actually need jQuery ?  “ @ toddmotto :   @ freakyDaz This might help you on your journey  :  )   -  
-0.52	 @ toddmotto Even so I had always seen getElementById that I had presumed there wasn’t a class equivalent .  Thanks for that  # shelteredbyjquery
-0.52	Oh the joys of hacking extra fields into wordpress .   # sarcasm
-0.52	 @ toddmotto  .   .   .  Oh  .   .   .  My  .   .   .  God .  Well if anything you’ve cut my use of frameworks down to a minimum just with that . 
-0.52	 @ toddmotto I think most people just want class selectors .  Unless I’m thick it isn’t something easily achievable without a selector engine ? 
-0.52	 @ toddmotto In my defence I try to use some of the smaller libraries where jQuery is simply over - kill .  It’s something I want to improve
-0.52	 @ toddmotto Personally I find vanilla javascript a bit of a minefield .  There are lots of small differences between browsers .  I do agree tho
-0.52	That’s right !  You can’t take my parking space today !  Because I came in bloody early to stop you !  Now do one . 
-0.52	 @ fabpot  @ github yep  :  ( 
-0.52	Today was a big day… I discovered  ` git stash `  .  Thank you lord ! 
-0.52	It may be old but I always find  @ codinghorror’s visual join explanation helpful .  
-0.52	What version of PHP was  ` final `  introduced into ? 
-0.52	 @ neiltak Ohhh yeah !  Oh wow bookmarking .  That’s awesome thanks ! 
-0.52	 @ neiltak I’m a little thick so can I ask what it is intended for ?  Email attachments or something else ?  Just a proof of concept is also fine
-0.52	 @ sazzy haha priceless
-0.52	Looking forward to just laying down and listening to a podcast or two .
