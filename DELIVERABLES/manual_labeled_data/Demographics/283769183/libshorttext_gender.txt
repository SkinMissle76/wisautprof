-1	 @ nimbushosting Do you know what caused the downtime earlier this morning ?

-1	Going to go see flight tonight .  Or thats the plan at least . 
-1	 @ nimbushosting All appears to be working so no downtime as of yet .

-1	Possibly my current favourite place on the internet :  
-1	Okay finally have a very old rails app updated to patch the security issues .  Now I can relax . 
-1	 @ xoxjordanaxox Good luck  : D
-1	 @ xoxjordanaxox Yeah most churches have choirs .  It might not be as good but I bet it costs considerably less
-1	 @ xoxjordanaxox ouch a grand lol .  Have you been to surrounding churches and asked if they know any ? 
-1	 @ xoxjordanaxox have you not found one ?  or is it just the cost of them ? 
-1	Started moving my DNS records over to  @ nimbushosting .  Hopefully it all goes smoothly . 
-1	 @ samUK Cheers .  I hadn’t thought about that .  4x4 perfection right there . 
-1	 @ samUK you should really go with an actual insurance company as opposed to an African mammal… Just sayin’
-1	My mortgage has been accepted !  Okay now just need the solicitors to speed up and get me a moving date .   # bloodyexcited  # verypoor
-1	 @ thomasfuchs My host only ever recommends centos but it is a massive pain to install latest libraries on . 
-1	 @ sazzy I’ve always had this issue .  It has to be a hardcoded restriction within chrome . 
-1	 @ dionnewilsher Have fun . 
-1	Listening to  @ ShopTalkShow as I unwind for the day .

-1	 @ peterjlambert Congratulations ! 
-1	So easy !  Does your project actually need jQuery ?  “ @ toddmotto :   @ freakyDaz This might help you on your journey  :  )   -  
-1	 @ toddmotto Even so I had always seen getElementById that I had presumed there wasn’t a class equivalent .  Thanks for that  # shelteredbyjquery
-1	Oh the joys of hacking extra fields into wordpress .   # sarcasm
-1	 @ toddmotto  .   .   .  Oh  .   .   .  My  .   .   .  God .  Well if anything you’ve cut my use of frameworks down to a minimum just with that . 
-1	 @ toddmotto I think most people just want class selectors .  Unless I’m thick it isn’t something easily achievable without a selector engine ? 
-1	 @ toddmotto In my defence I try to use some of the smaller libraries where jQuery is simply over - kill .  It’s something I want to improve
-1	 @ toddmotto Personally I find vanilla javascript a bit of a minefield .  There are lots of small differences between browsers .  I do agree tho
-1	That’s right !  You can’t take my parking space today !  Because I came in bloody early to stop you !  Now do one . 
-1	 @ fabpot  @ github yep  :  (

-1	What version of PHP was  ` final `  introduced into ? 
-1	 @ neiltak Ohhh yeah !  Oh wow bookmarking .  That’s awesome thanks ! 
-1	 @ neiltak I’m a little thick so can I ask what it is intended for ?  Email attachments or something else ?  Just a proof of concept is also fine
-1	 @ sazzy haha priceless
-1	Looking forward to just laying down and listening to a podcast or two .
