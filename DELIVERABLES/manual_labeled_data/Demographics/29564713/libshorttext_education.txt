3	 @ grahamrhay

3	 @ MichelleFlynn I think you mean 
3	Woohoo .  .  .  new  @ 7digital website live !  
3	Rewatching Stephen Kings It for the first time since childood .  The acting is cringeworthy :  how did I ever find this scary ?  ! 
3	Bizarrely ,   # Vim on the iPhone is a pleasant experience .  Only problem is I dont ever need to edit text other than msgs or tweets ! 
3	Finally got round to installing VsVim today .  Looks very promising .   # Vim  # visualstudio
3	So it turns out the email from virgin media about my no cost upgrade to 120Mbit broadband was  " sent in error "  .   Oops !   # MassiveFail
3	Something needs to be done about copyright law ,  particularly in the US .    # SOPA has so much mindshare  -  Come on brits  # HelpRichardODwyer
3	Virgin are upgrading our broadband from 50mbit to 120mbit at no extra cost .  Nice ! 
3	Ooh interesting !  
3	Just upgraded my  # iphone to  # ios5 .  lost all my itunes content .  Reinstalled  @ 7digital app and its all still there ,  no redownloading !   :  ) 
3	Wow ,   # syntastic has made my day .  How did I bear writing  # javascript in  # vim without it ? 
3	 @ louissschang silly patent legislation .  Have you seen this ?  
3	 @ mwjacks0n yeah that does look nice .   Im pairing with  @ willjamestech next week on some node innovation time so that will be handy . 
3	 @ mwjacks0n yeah sublime does look really nice .   Im a bit loathe to pay for it though . 
3	 @ TonyTo85  @ mwjacks0n vim is all you need  : P
3	 @ jpluscplusm PLEASE COME TO WORK IN THAT .   I would think you a greater man for it ! 
3	 @ TonyTo85  @ BarisBalic You lose an IQ point for every hour spent looking at  # VB code  # FACT
3	Context switching from  # nodejs to  # vb is about as enjoyable as punching yourself in the face . 
3	 " Discover  [  .  .  .  ]  a stream of useful and entertaining information ,  customized just for you "  So why is it full of irrelevant shite ?   # newtwitter
3	 @ LukeTownsin Thanks mate .   Yeah it was ,  though I have a pretty hazy memory !   Glad I had yesterday off  :  )

3	 @ daphnechong you installed  @ grahamrhay on your iphone ?  !   Is that like siri but with sarcastic replies ?  ! 
3	Looking forward to  # londdonjs tonight
3	 @ polotek just watched your nodeconf talk  -  shame you didnt have more time .   Im keen to know more ,  where can I find the slides ?

3	 @ ciaran _ j that looks really interesting ,  shame its in Manchester otherwise Id go . 
3	 @ stevelosh I quite like them .   Isnt the color good enough to indicate the suit ?   Not great if youre colour blind I suppose though ! 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall 
3	 @ MarkNijhof  @ Ben _ Hall OAuth will be available because of the closure .   My guess is the extension of Object . prototype  ( no key / secret to test ) 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall That may well interfere with some internal object iteration
3	 @ Ben _ Hall is it only happening when you extend Object . prototype  ?    ( I assume you have a  * very *  good reason to do that ) 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall I have that library working well in the  @ 7digitalapi nodejs wrapper .  Is there no error msg ? 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall need more context ,  whats the error ?  or gist an example ? 
3	 @ louissschang it was inevitable ,  sooner or later .  Mwahahaha ! 
3	RT :  Arrested .  
3	Got tickets to see  @ devhynes at shacklewell arms with  @ Ben _ Maddison and  @ yeoldedawg on 3rd Dec .  Cant wait !   # BloodOrange  / cc  @ Alexcorradi

3	 @ LukeTownsin I didnt know about it . 
3	 @ beardscratcher 
3	 @ chrisevans1982  @ yeoldedawg yeah I saw that when I was looking last week .   Its possible ,  though I reckon  A Night With .  .  .  will be better . 
3	 @ mwjacks0n yeah i would have liked to have been to that .  I was ill unfortunately .  I met  @ seddonandrew at node knockout ,  hes a nice guy . 
3	Listening to xmas songs in the dark in KFC in Dalston .  .  .  on my own .   # LivingTheDream

3	Use Alt +  & lt ; movement & gt ;  in insert mode to enter normal mode and perform the movement without leaving the homerow  # vim  / cc  @ vimtips
3	 @  _ duncanhall that would be much easier to fix with git .   Branches and merging are much more natural .   :  ) 
3	 @  _ duncanhall time to move to git  ;  ) 
3	Wow  @ amazon youre customer support is brilliant .   3rd time Ive had to contact you now ,  and its been impecable each time . 
3	The more I use it ,  the more I like mintty .   No more urxvt in  # cygwin for me .   # tech  # unix

3	Jottify app looks like a really cool idea for budding authors .  Launching at  # fowa
3	The MS guy is getting grilled by  @ slightlylate in the browser panel at  # fowa  -  love it ! 
3	 @ teabass thats a hell of a lot of pizza !  I better get there early to make sure I get some  :  ) 
3	 @ LukeTownsin not to be a pedant but that photo looks like the exact opposite of what Id consider to be kicking off ! 
3	 @ Meerface no ,  Im not ,  I didnt get round to getting tickets ,  Im not sure I want to be sitting down when I go to see metronomy ! 
3	Ok ,  Im starting to feel really bored of being ill now .   Come - on immune system ,  harden the f * ck up ! 
3	oi  @ mixcloud whats with the spam every connected social media site by default when doing anything setting ?  not cool  :  ( 
3	 @ perksc Thanks .  No late nights :  we dont have a culture of that here at 7d thankfully  :  )  Continuous Deployment ftw ! 
3	New  @ 7digital site public beta is live 
3	 @ BarisBalic  @ louissschang Im in it for the fame and glory .  Mwahahaha ! 
3	 @ louissschang im doing this if youre interested :  
3	 @ londonjs when can we expect more details on the hackathon ?   Teams or solo entries only ?  Max teamsize ?   # centralhack
3	 @ perksc only  - 4 ?  Are you baking a meat pie ?  ! 
3	 @ mwjacks0n thats pretty cool .  Love the ui config .  I use vcprompt and did the colors manually .  This would have been faster though . 
3	 @ cam _ sf I think the what you are looking for is a mirror ! 
3	Whats with all the HTML5 operating systems today ?  Am I missing something ?  Do we really need an operating system in the browser ? 
3	 @ louissschang I imagine functions in general look weird to you ! 
3	functions with return values instead of callbacks in  # nodejs just look weird to me now .   # tech
3	No way DJ Mehdi died ?  !  
3	Brendan Eich speaks out on Dart :  
3	 @ BarisBalic Thanks ,  nice .  I made the switch to  # vim recently and Im not convinced I want to go back !   # editors  # flamewar
3	 # Vims  # clojure plugin is superb .  cant help thinking I should be using  # emacs though ! 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall  @ holytshirt long wait for the bus .  Should be 15 mins or so
3	 @ Ben _ Hall deal ,  Ill head off now .  See you shortly . 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall cool ,  well it will take me 25 mins to get down to shoreditch .   where you thinking ? 
3	 @ dctanner no worries .   keep me posted . 
3	 @ dctanner You didnt reply to my email about the nko t - shirts .   Do you want  an address instead ? 
3	 @ Ben _ Hall ill meet you for a beer .   Im off this week . 
3	 @ bnathyuw stop swearing ! 
3	 @ rchatley it seems reasonable to me .  Im sure most companies using clojure  wouldnt mind paying that .   Tougher for an individual though . 
3	 @ robbowley I had a feeling that would be the answer ,  worth a shot ,  though !   ;  ) 
3	 @ rchatley Id love to but I cant justify that sort of expense for 1 day of  # clojure training ,  unless  @ robbowley is feeling generous ! 
3	Really starting to enjoy  # clojure 2 days of koans and reading and I feel like I have just enough tools to attempt to make something . 
3	Hello new M . A . N . D . Y .  Body Language mix  :  )   # tunes
3	 @ robbowley  @ rchatley its certainly elegant ,  even the expressions are called  " forms "  !  Still not 100 %  sold on the parentheses yet  # clojure
3	 @ rchatley after day 1 :  finding the functional nature easy to grasp  ( prob due to JavaScript )  but prefix notation is slowing me down .   # clojure
3	 @ mwjacks0n cool ,  well im up for that .  Come round to mine if you like .  Im in highbury . 
3	 @ TonyTo85 I knew about ClojureScript but not that .   Interesting .   Im just learning it to broaden my horizons  :  )   # clojure
3	 @ mwjacks0n I am ,  what are you thinking ? 
3	 @ TonyTo85 bumbling around typing out commands into the REPL verbatim from a tutorial  : P  # clojure
3	 @ rchatley ill let you know .   Im starting with this tutorial :  
3	Today feels like a good day to learn some  # clojure
3	Congratulations  @ 3rdEden
3	 @ philb0  " It wasnt me guv ,  honest !  "  yeah I didnt really think that bit through ,  did I ?  ! 
3	 @ philb0 ha ha ,  I knew that would come back to haunt me ! 
3	 @ mwjacks0n cool ,  well just give me a shout Im hacking most of the week . 
3	 @ mwjacks0n yeah thats a good un  :  )  im off all next week if youre around and fancy some hacking ? 
3	 @ ciaran _ j my bad ,  it was the differing signatures between get and post throwing me off .  All working now using get  /  post thanks
3	Rediscovering some aeroplane remixes to get me in the mood for the weekend and a weeks holiday 
3	 @ mwjacks0n not yet .  Ill have a look when im home . 
3	 @ dotvimrc autocmd BufWritePre  *  . js  :  % s /  \ s \  +  $  /  / e to remove trailing whitespace when saving javascript files  ( modify the glob for other types ) 
3	 @ ciaran _ j Im resorting to calling oauth .  _ performSecureRequest to do 2 - legged oauth ,  is there a better way ?   # oauth
3	 @ Cranialstrain  @ magicbobson I read less books more code these days  :  )   The books I do tend to be JavaScript or patterns based . 
3	Uncle Bulgaria and the Restraining Orders !  
3	 @ BarisBalic yeah we  * should *  be doing this in HAProxy ,  too much to do ,  to little time unfortunately . 
3	 @ BarisBalic on an older system we add IP restrictions in IIS with vbs called by msbuild called by rake ,  triggered by teamcity !   # inception
3	 @ BarisBalic I feel your pain .   Current status :  debugging vbs scripts in our build chain for adding IP restrictions .   # legacycode
