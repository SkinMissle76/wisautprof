-1	 @ 7brokenbricks The original premise is the only defined definition ,  thus far . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks What’s your definition of market value ?  I’m using ‘peers in the market are paid similarly . ’Org value  !  =  market value
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks Unless you’re referring to coops or nonprofits ,  of course . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks If the root definition is correct ,  the natural result is all profits are shared with employees .  Not the same as now . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks The value to the organisation would be determined by the organisation ,  and the revenue it generates  -  so ,  it depends . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks That’s the argument based on the logic in the quote ,  as I’ve interpreted it . 
-1	 @ RupertRead Progress starts with wishes ;  how else do we know what to aim for ? 
-1	 @ RupertRead Perhaps ,  to avoid bias ,  all funding from pro - GMO orgs must be matched by funds from anti - GMO orgs .  Counterbias built into funds ? 
-1	 @ RupertRead Universities and grant making organisations usually fund that sort of research . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks Amount of  $  that can be generated by that laborers work . It varies by laborer and by company . 
-1	 @ RupertRead What’s more ,  looking at vested interests shows where the counterarguments come from . As ever ,  follow the money . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks B4 deciding whether you agree w the statement ,  you have to put aside the existing concept that markets determine labor value . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks That’s in the first tweet . Labor determines the value of everything .  So the value of everything is the sum total of its labor
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks If the concept is accepted as true ,  the rest becomes details to resolve ,  probably at an individual company level . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks I think were looking at it from different perspectives .  Neither calculation nor definition are as important as the concept .

-1	 @ 7brokenbricks It’d also imply  ( this is where things get confusing )  that people shld be paid according to their org value ,  not market value . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks Which means that company income is evenly divisible by the value of the labor of the employees ,  leaving no extra profits . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks Therefore ,  to pay laborers fairly would require them receiving a portion of the orgs income equal to their labor value . 
-1	 @ 7brokenbricks Labor is the only creator of value in a company .  A company’s value is the sum of the value of the labor provided .  1 / 2
