3	 @ LiquidReZZ depends if youre a middle aged ,  middle class housewife ,  otherwise its obviously Southern Comfort
3	My brother thinks drinking southern comfort neat is apparently not the way to do it ,  because it lacks class .  Hes changed .   / cc  @ liquidrezz
3	 @ MichelleFlynn  @ huddle  @ 7digital theres definitely some cheese involved .  Otherwise itd be  # beerclub ,  now theres an idea .  .  . 
3	 @ MichelleFlynn  @ huddle  @ 7digital Ive got one from the East Midlands and one mainly consisting of beer  -  also a description of me . 
3	 @ Podgeypoos79  @ tonyrogerson sounds like Im going to have to think of ways for you to earn it .  You done those reports yet ? 
3	 @ cam _ sf would have gone for either .  My favourite is a pros spare cos you know its well treated and hardly used .  Refurbs have warranty tho
3	 @ will _ james heres a little linky to sort your phone out 
3	 @ AnthonySteele and quite a fun sport too
3	 @ AnthonySteele one of their main UK distribution centres is in Bedford with mainly fields between it and my house .  Hope its real ,  doubt it . 
3	 @ MichelleFlynn yes ,  hang around in the Guinness bar to overhear good tips .  My brother used to work that bar just to get inside info . 
3	 @ Paulswilliamsuk and next week the group will be 3 years old ! 
3	 @ ruby _ gem  @ BDWFlowers a duo surely
3	 @ fffej yeah !  Most useful book youll ever read .  Not a bad story too . 
3	 @ robbowley  @ MAA1 that shrine needs some carefully written and detailed notes in a quirky notebook .  And a bagel . 
3	 @ cj _ smithy I think you paced it really well ,  just right for the last session on a Friday .  Will DM u shortly
3	 @ cj _ smithy great talk on retrospectives ,  I think our teams often take them for granted and think they always work .  Are your slides public ? 
3	Slides from our  # agilecam talk on Adapting Teams for Continuous Delivery  @ 7digital are here 
3	 @ ivanrmoore sorry to disturb ,  do you ,  by any remote chance ,  still have your resources from the Refactoring Golf session you did at SC2010 ?

3	 @ Podgeypoos79 Tesla coils played by blocks on a ReactTable ,  and a xylosynth
3	 @ Podgeypoos79 bitbucket
3	Had a good response from justeat :  a failing on their part ,  human intervention caused disparity between systems .  Raj Bengal absolved
3	 @ JustEatUK sorry .  Far too late for that ,  had to cook something myself .  So much for your slogan eh ?  Heres the number tho 52194567
3	Absolutely crap service from justeat and the Raj Bengal in Biggleswade .  One says order is fine and on its way ,  other says not had order . 
3	 @ unclebobmartin if you are around on Thursday you should join us for our discussion of  " the future "

3	 @ MatStace get the oculus rift and the AR drone out of the cupboard and learn to fly . 
3	 @ gemtriesharder yeah !  Only on Saturday though .  Ill be there with a tall Welshman ,  my lovely wife and my little boy in a pushchair . 
3	 @ Paulswilliamsuk wouldnt it ?  It would be compelling to watch progress once a week .  Better than the current rehash offering  # leanapprentice
3	 @ ntcoding are you volunteering to coordinate that ?  Nice one ,  youll do well . 
3	 @ ntcoding they did .  Dan looked at catalogue matching algorithms and Chris wrote his own unit testing framework for chrome plugins

3	Slides from last nights  # ldncto event :  Scaling Teams ,  Scaling Software at 7digital

3	Ill be at the New Music Seminar in New York next week .  Come and quiz me about our technology and API 
3	 @ HafdisHuld great show tonight .  Looking forward to the album and new tour .  I even managed to impress  @ beardscratcher by inviting him along
3	 @ beardscratcher a tip that proves I have truly made it as a music company hipster .  Watch out skinny jeans here I come . 
3	 @ codeburst  @ MichelleFlynn remote working is difficult for us as were very collaborative .  Worth exploring ideas though so will drop u a line
3	Anyone fancy joining me for some top quality ,  and exclusive ,  Icelandic pop - folk - pop next Thursday with Hafdis Huld ?  
3	 @ Paulswilliamsuk met a guy recently who writes GPS tracking software for cars .  His UAT is in the car park .  Bit of a feedback loop there too
3	 @ mharrigan  @ markkirschstein the handicap of 12 months in management too  ;  ) 
3	 @ markkirschstein we decided today were going to teach  @ mharrigan to write code again so well send him your way for hackmanchester 2013

3	Its graduation day at the 7digital Technical Academy .  Mortar boards ,  copies of  # goos ,  prosecco and Bob Marley on the Pure wireless speakers
3	 @ henryoswald  @ pereiragoncalo no but we might make you do a speech .  Or print certificates in LaTeX ,  collaboratively
3	 @ henryoswald were having a graduation party at the office tomorrow for the Academy .  5pm in the atrium .  Would be grand if you can join us . 
3	 @ sharelatex sounds like a great feature .  Academics I know love drop box for sharing and versioning ,  will have to get them to use LaTeX more
3	 @ MAA1  " expert programmer "  over  " broad distributor "   -  good idea ,  shame the media are still fixated on vanity metrics of quantity over quality
3	Ive  # justsponsored Harriet Shannon on  @ JustGiving .  Support her and Great Ormond Street Hospital Childrens Charity 
3	 @ Podgeypoos79 is it breakfast ?  Because dont worry I have that covered

3	 @ samwessel you know you were after recommendations of conferences to go to :  
3	 @ Podgeypoos79  @ cam _ sf is it the less sweary dubbed version ,   " this city is like a chicken waiting to be plucked "  ? 
3	 @ Podgeypoos79  @ robbowley  @ gregsochanik clearly a fake ,  everyone knows I dont drink coffee .  Also I appear to be programming .  Never happened
3	 @ robbowley  @ kevinrutherford that tiny cup is throwing the perspective off  @ gregsochanik is really that big .   # internetfamous
3	 @ johnC _ bristol no problem .  I joined a mailing list recently that discusses similar stuff set up by a friend in Mcr :  
3	 @ MarkDalgarno theres a place near the Grafton centre ,  down Fair Street called Nobby  & amp ;  I .  Tiny ,  inexpensive and great craftsmanship
3	 @ zenonhannick great talk just now ,  good luck on the night .  Contact me on paul . shannon @ 7digital . com and we can meet up after its all done  ;  ) 
3	 @ echodeck  @ samwessel cool .  Knew something was going down .  Ill send you an email as I have a plan .

3	 @ leeporte  @ tonydenyer  @ samwessel my mother - in - law was impressed .  Its the way you tell em
3	 @ samwessel that one was from  @ tonydenyer at the most recent 7digital cheese club .  He had 2 others ,  obviously not as memorable though
3	 @ samwessel which cheeses drift through an open window ?  Light Bries  / cc  @ rubygem
3	 @ Paulswilliamsuk  @ JohnnoNolan indeed .  Been using it in production for some time .  Simple ,  logical ,  extensible .  Ousted openrasta and nancyfx
3	 @ MatStace bet you didnt look weird taking pictures in the underwear section of Sainsburys
3	Watching my old mate  @ samwessel give a talk in Nottingham while Im on the train from London .  Very geeky ,  even for  @ geekupnotts
3	 @ samwessel you can definitely make it do that .  The paths that reveal stuff are arbitrary and can include sounds . 
3	 @ samwessel with a pixelated font and prezi you could probably do similar with little effort
3	 @ robbowley  @ kevinrutherford considered the mini for my wife too ,  her sister has a Huawei which she likes . 
3	 @ markkirschstein  @ kevinrutherford just got a nexus 4 yesterday so my wife can have my galaxy nexus .  Both fit in pocket well due to shape
3	 @ fidothe  @ rachelcdavies neither had done TDD or SOLID stuff .  Theyd both done enough programming to know it was an interesting career

3	 @ kaminskipawel are you coming to Devs in the Ditch on Thursday ?  Im speaking about our apprenticeships and technical academy . 
3	 @ ChrisAnnODell I saw the panicking staff .  It was actually the back of the train .  Plenty of police around too . 
3	 @ ChrisAnnODell southbound tube line had someone injured near front of train .  Saw aftermath while going north after getting on at moorgate . 
3	 @ LiquidReZZ actually ,  more to the point ,  why you watch channel 5 ?  It had better be Mega Movers or Ice Road Truckers .
