-1	That seems odd .  .  .  
-1	Lolololololol everyone is falling for that picture from Lambeau ,  even though the Packers posted it on Instagram two weeks ago . 
-1	 @ IamtherealDiddy yup exactly !  No one could offer the amount of money that the NFL makes from SB commercials ,  plus everything you said . 
-1	3 . 9 seconds .  Vomit . 
-1	 @ IamtherealDiddy haha thats brilliant !  The only game they couldnt do that with is the Super Bowl ,  but I love the idea . 
-1	 @ IamtherealDiddy thats a really good idea actually . 
-1	Dayyyyyy automotiveeeeeee ,  were gonna make your day ! 
-1	GREAT VIEW  @ ROOTSPORTSPIT
-1	My God what a dive by Geno lol
-1	As much as I dislike those Michael Bolton commercials ,  theyre MUCH better than that awful Austin Mahone / McDonalds commercial . 
-1	 # LGP
-1	 @ IamtherealDiddy right ?  !  I dont get it at all ! 
-1	Genos back )  )  )  )  )  ) 
-1	MAF just said on In The Room that their practice open to local kids was louder than their games .  Thats sad . 
-1	Can anyone explain to me why players get fined for not speaking with the media ? 
-1	 @ Sticks1610S  @ Stew3Brew awesome .  Well ,  for  $ 40 I dont expect it to be perfect .  The quality of them look pretty good in the pictures . 
-1	 @ Stew3Brew sweet .  They have blank Team USA jerseys for  $ 40 so I was thinking about ordering one . 
-1	So Pau Gasol is getting traded for Andrew Bynum straight - up ?   @ Eli _ Duarte ,  Im here for you ,  yo . 
-1	Looking to buy a hockey jersey from Borntrade for the first time .  Can anyone tell me how they are ?  Quality ,  shipping ,  etc ? 
-1	 @ RustyRafferty oh absolutely .  Seriously ,  its just a game .  Its fun to watch the sport  & amp ;  just be laid back about it while watching your team
-1	 @ RustyRafferty which is actually pretty ironic coming from a Chelsea fan considering they won it last year lol
-1	 @ RustyRafferty hahaha I didnt even notice that .  Hope he enjoys the Europa League . 
-1	 @ RustyRafferty its so unnecessary .  Calling someone a half breed is far from being  " banter .  " 
-1	Hey ,  remember that whole thing about how bad the Saints are in the cold ? 
-1	 @ RustyRafferty your interaction with that Spurs fan was great .  So is Theo Walcott . 
-1	Beautiful .  RT  @ Footy _ Jokes :  Walcott .  
-1	Itd be different if Indys O - line was awful like Miamis ,  but Richardson cant even hold on to the ball . 
-1	I used the 10th pick in my fantasy league to draft Trent Richardson . 
-1	LOL Indy .  Wow . 
-1	 @ hayPENS oh absolutely .  What makes it even more awkward is watching the brides parents while the groom is removing it with his mouth . 
-1	 @ hayPENS Ive DJd 20 - ish weddings in the past few years  & amp ;  thats probably the most awkward moment of the night . 
-1	This new friendship between  @ Jared _ Carrabis  & amp ;   @ DAVIDprice14 is awesome . 
-1	Pretty cool seeing a school an hour away with a history of terrible football teams ,  and now theyre playing for the FCS championship . 
-1	Touchdown Towson ! 
-1	 @ hayPENS haha just kidding .  Honestly ,  theres not much better to do at 3 : 49 a . m .  haha . 
-1	 @ hayPENS  # HaylieAfterDark
-1	Going to bed at a reasonable hour would probably be a step in the right direction to fixing my sleep schedule . 
-1	Fixed RT  @ FOXSportsLive :  3 Things You Need To Know :  1 .  Missouri wins  # CottonBowl  2 .  Clemson wins  # OrangeBowl  3 .  Were  & gt ;  than SportsCenter .

-1	 @ tessa _ jw you suck !  Haha
-1	 @ thegreatdane _ uh youre such a cat lady . 
-1	 @ Josh11Booth I need a BF4 partner !  haha
-1	 @ hayPENS its pathetic that some females have to do that for attention .  Then again ,  a lot of guys are pigs  & amp ;  are in to that sort of thing . 
-1	 @ 2KSupport 4 days since I submitted my ticket  & amp ;  still havent gotten any response .  .  . 
-1	Woah ,  a  @ billburr reference during the Pens game ?  !  ? 
-1	 # LT thats tied for 3rd in the NHL ,  not just on the Pens ,  btw . 
-1	Kunitz is tied for 3rd in goals ,  and yet some people still dont think he deserves to be a part of Team Canada . 
-1	Hahahahahaha
-1	I should re - phrase that .  I dont hate hockey ,  but  # TheCode is a load of horse shit . 
-1	Sometimes I really hate hockey .  I could be wrong ,  but Engelland just threw a clean check ,   & amp ;  Errey wants Callahan to step up  & amp ;  fight ? 
-1	Oh sweet Jesus .  Filthy backhand by Sid . 
-1	 # LT anyone want to give me the cliff notes version of the article ? 
-1	Just tried to read that Burnside piece then realized the Pens game would be over before I even finish reading it . 
-1	Sill is out there trying to kill people . 
-1	JUICY J x2
-1	OH SWEET LINCOLNS MULLET WHAT A GOAL

-1	My God .  Unreal play by Sid . 
-1	KUNI !  !  !

-1	 @ kevincalhounjr drafted Cousins was because thats who Shanahan wanted ,   & amp ;  he said hed resign if they didnt draft him . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr no doubt about that .  No idea if this is true ,  but a friend  ( Skins fan )  told me the other day that the only reason they
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr speaking of WAS ,  I think the best part about them going 3 - 13 is that they dont even have a 1st round pick lol
-1	On December 29 ,  2013 ,  she missed a 41 yard field goal that kept the Steelers out of the playoffs .   # HaylieSmearCampaign
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr haha if they draft Manziel  & amp ;  sign MJD ,  Im buying a Manziel jersey . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr mother of God .  Thats not bad at all .  Somehow convince Gruden to move to a Cleveland suburb  & amp ;  coach the team . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr the Browns have a solid foundation though ,  like you said .  Give a new coach  & amp ;  QB a chance to succeed with each other . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr very true .  Honestly I think the best QB job open right now is Houston .  Good run game when healthy .  Andre Johnson .  Great D . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr idk if A & amp ; M necessarily deserved to win ,  but they sure as hell found a way .  I really hope he doesnt go to the Browns . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr Manziel ? 
-1	Im not trying to sound like a badass ,  because Im far from it ,  but Im just saying .  . 
-1	So many people that have never been in a fight are entering the Toughman .  L - O - L
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr yup pretty much .  The game was pretty good in the first half ,  2nd half was kinda meh . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr somewhat .  Trevor Knight  ( OU freshman QB )  played insane .  Bama had 5 turnovers  & amp ;  Oklahoma scored 28 points off of them . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr haha all good .  I just enjoy watching Bama  & amp ;  McCarron play .  Feels like an NFL - type team ,  except for tonight of course . 
-1	 @ kevincalhounjr haha they cant win em all .  Cant wait for McCarron to get drafted by the Jags  & amp ;  end his career before it began . 
-1	 @ Eli _ Duarte hahahaha nothing that you do ever surprises me anymore  : P
-1	 @ Eli _ Duarte HAHAHAHAHAHA ohhhh Eli ,  never ever change lol
-1	Lol wow ,  Bama is just getting embarrassed now . 
-1	Really ?  Its gonna end like that ? 
-1	Chris Kluwe is a great person ,  and that means a hell of a lot more than being a great football player . 
-1	Today felt like a Monday .  .  . 
-1	Amari Cooper  # YAC
-1	AJ McCarron is 36 - 3 as a starter in college .  Unreal . 
-1	 # RollTide
-1	 @ ShawniEvans oh absolutely lol .  People get so bent out of shape . 
-1	In recent history ,  Oklahoma is like the Buffalo Bills of college football .  Make it a big game  -  chokes . 
-1	 @ Stew3Brew absolutely .  Hopefully he goes to a team with weapons like Wilson did . 
-1	Its really mind - boggling that AJ McCarron isnt even mentioned as a top 5 pick . 
-1	The best team in college football is playing tonight . 
-1	 * checks Facebook rant for spelling  & amp ;  grammatical errors * 
-1	So jammed up right now . 
-1	Nickname jerseys ?  Really ?  Is the NBA trying to prove just how bad they can be ? 
-1	 @ thegreatdane _ uh RT  @ GingerGathering :   # KissAGingerDay is Sunday 12th January .  We will be waiting for 😘😊 # ginger 
-1	Any time this Nyquil wants to kick in would be great . 
-1	Why do people have to rain on other peoples parades ?  If its something they love  & amp ;  are passionate about ,  who says they cant do it ? 
-1	I hate when people say  " good luck finding a job in that field ,  its so hard to get in to .  "  NO DUH DIPSHIT ,  IM WELL - AWARE OF THAT . 
-1	The lead singer of Mumford  & amp ;  Sons kinda looks like Tim Tebow ,  and the keyboard player looks like someone they picked up off the street . 
-1	I could listen to Mumford  & amp ;  Sons all day every day . 
-1	For real though ,  taking advantage of drunk people on cab fares is kinda like date rape ,  right ? 
-1	Just checked out  @ ubers mentions .  Ohhhhh dear Jesus that was entertaining . 
-1	Went to Sheetz earlier  & amp ;  Ignition by R .  Kelly came on the radio .  Lets just say middle school Kyle had a party on the way to Sheetz . 
-1	Acoustic versions of songs are usually infinitely better than the original version . 
-1	Poppin Bortles . 
-1	Holy front flip .  Bryce Petty .  Wow . 
-1	 # Storm
-1	Nice to see that Good Burger gave RG3 - 13 the night off so he could attend the Fiesta Bowl . 
-1	 @ RustyRafferty solid choice . 
-1	 @ Stew3Brew oh absolutely .  Brandon Weeden was supposed to be their franchise QB ,  and he just turned 30 lol
-1	 @ RustyRafferty Im curious about who the other one is . 
-1	Being called  " dummy "  on Twitter has been the high - point of my 2014 . 
-1	 @ Stew3Brew thatd be great .  ESPN was praising Manziels  " leadership ability "  last night .  Could you imagine him trying to  " lead "  the Browns . 
-1	UCFs running back is named  " Storm Johnson ?  "  Certainly Storm isnt his biological name .  .  . 
-1	Look out ,  keyboard warrior coming .  .  . 
-1	 @ WFinchner hey  " dummy ,  "  unfortunately Bobby Ryans peers didnt select the team .  Ryan deserved to make it over Blake fucking Wheeler . 
-1	Those Baylor helmets are pretty sick though . 
-1	Hopefully the Fiesta Bowl is pretty good .  I think WVU just scored on Oklahoma again . 
-1	Blake Bortles sounds like the name of a QB that the Cleveland Browns will ruin . 
-1	Up in the air over who to root for in this UCF - Baylor game .   # RGIII  # RG3  # RGTHREEINTHIRTEEN
-1	People are still jammed up over the Team USA Olympic roster ?  People can still get injured  & amp ;  lose their spot .  Calm down . 
-1	Seriously ,  if my parents slipped an  " r "  in to the end of my first name ,  I wouldve been pissed . 
-1	What kind of first name is  " Kyler ?  " 
-1	Honestly ,  the illegal man down field penalty is another penalty that is idiotic .  Seriously .  You wanna throw it to a lineman ?  Go right ahead . 
-1	 @ Eli _ Duarte hahahaha not from me .  Sorry ! 
-1	This Rose Bowl game has been very good . 
-1	 @ Eli _ Duarte hahahaha youre ridiculous .
