17	 @ JulianBirch  @ swannodette  @ tgkristensen it does seem a little a little redundant to package the js into a clojar
17	 @ swannodette  @ tgkristensen sorry yes .  I can now see it with tar  - tf  ~  /  . m2 / repository / com / facebook / react / 0 . 8 . 0 . 1react - 0 . 8 . 0 . 1 . jar thx 4 help
17	 @ swannodette  @ tgkristensen ok its coming together for me  ( face palm )  its within the OM jar 
17	 @ swannodette hi .  Do you know much about the clojurescript extern  " react / externs / react . js "  used in the OM todomvc demo ? 
17	 @ tgkristensen I kid you not  :  )  the cljsbuild is fetching it from somewhere .  I thought it was here 
17	 @ r4vi Ahh thx .  .   I have found the common contrib repo  :  )  the cljsbuild must check this 
17	 @ tgkristensen Is there a central clojurescript externs repo somewhere I dont know about ? 
17	 @ tgkristensen somewhere on the internet there is something that points  : externs react / react . min . js .  .  to the latest facebook minified reactjs
17	 @ tgkristensen thx .  whats puzzling is I dont include react anywhere in project .  except the extern .  yet compiler downloads latest version
17	Anyone know any good explanations of clojurescript externs ?  where do they come from ?  eg  : externs  [  " react / externs / react . js "  ]   ?  ?

17	 @ flowchainsensei great thanks .  .  Let me take a read and get back
17	 @ drunkcod thx .  Do you know if this has been implemented anywhere ?   / cc  @ flowchainsensei
