30	This has done the rounds before but I saw it again and it made me laugh  -  If Carpenters Were Hired Like Programmers :  
30	 @ firagabeatsrock BOOM

30	 @ irutsun Happy Birthday Dearest ,  it broke my heart that I couldnt be there x
30	 @ firagabeatsrock when I got bored with it ,  i realised it was partly because every game Id played for about a year had been a zombie game
30	Shaved off my  # Movember moustache .  Now my reflection looks weird .  .  .  like it doesnt match the mental projection of my digital self . 
30	 @ firagabeatsrock I have State of Decay for Xbox ,  its alright ,  I got a few hours out of it ,  then got bored .  Really loving Papers ,  Please
30	 .  @ jonsnowC4  @ rooreynolds awkward seems harsh ,  I actually found it quite charming . 
30	What  @ jonsnowC4s awkward introduction to video games says about the state of mainstream discourse 
30	 @ LauraLovesBuble  @ neilkilbride hes a disgrace
30	 @ LauraLovesBuble thought you might enjoy seeing  @ neilkilbrides ramshackle lesbian face again

30	 @ jbjon  @ esendex not unsurprising  =  surprising
30	 @ samwessel ZING ! 
30	Blockbuster video in Chesterfield is closing ,  they announced it by taking down the sign that says  " Holy shit how are we still open ?  ?  " 
30	 @ MrChaz Amazon 
30	 @ jna _ sh yeah ,  that side works ok ,  not as good as just plugging an HDMI cable in though . 
30	 @ jna _ sh really great for  @ NetflixUK  & amp ;   @ YouTube on my TV ,  does bugger all else though
30	 @ jna _ sh theyre on Amazon for about 40 quid .  Thought it was worth a punt . 
30	Got a  # Chromecast  -  what it does ,  it does it REALLY well .  Problem is ,  it only does two things . 
30	 @ dotDestroyer how bigs the garden ? 
30	 @ PetraKaczor  @ esendexdev  @  _ and _ why _  whoever submitted it must have seen all this coming
30	 @ esendexdev  @  _ and _ why _   # truefacts
30	 @  _ and _ why _   @ esendexdev whatever gave you that idea ? 
30	 @ nattorama this has made me decide to finally go ahead and cancel my  @ lovefilm account . 
30	Asked  @ firagabeatsrock for some shampoo ,  he handed me this suspicious unmarked container  # powerplay 
30	Coffee break at  # MiniSPA in  @ redgates awesome offices in Cambridge  / cc :   @ spaconference 
30	 @ mpkhosla  @ CAH this game :  Cards Against Humanity UK edition
30	 @ kelleykelleyliu true ,  but not everyone has the opportunity . 
30	 @ firagabeatsrock probability is high
30	 .  @ CAH is still happening 
30	Found a better pub ,  now a few rounds of  @ CAH 
30	 " Ooh !  Live music !  "  he says .  
30	 @ adamgoodwin Im calling the police . 
30	 @ northernrailorg  @ metz1969  @ CountyKev82  were talking about the trains ,  that was a train toilet . 
30	I just saw Gravity ,  my mind went supernova .  Were all still talking about this film ,  right ?   .  .  .  Riiiiight ?   .  .  .  Guys ?   .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .   & lt ; beep & gt ; 
30	 @ ruby _ gem what ?  Why are you saying this ? 
30	 @ firagabeatsrock innit . 
30	 .  @ northernrailorg so the company that runs the train is not able to affect the condition of the train ?  Who signed this lease agreement ?  ? 
30	 @ northernrailorg thats not an excuse ,  you are responsible for the quality of your own service .  If that service is bad you must address it . 
30	 @ northernrailorg why not renovate them ?  This is the corroded old toilet on this train .  Your passengers are people !  
30	 @ northernrailorg Why is the state of your trains are so much worse than other train companies ?  The Notts - Leeds trains are filthy . 
30	 @ firagabeatsrock the conversation it is a part of is still in active development . 
30	 @ firagabeatsrock we already discussed why this statement isnt true . 
30	 @ MrChaz can you pay with Google Checkout ? 
30	 @ neilkilbride this is insane . 
30	 @ jbjon for a minute there I thought youd written it . 
30	 @ jbjon I am totally convinced by this measured ,  well balanced and critical review of the new features . 
30	 @ jbjon a 2nd user is joining ? 
30	 @ MrChaz  @ MrsEmma the point is ,  a few cyclists poor choices is no excuse for not addressing the fact that too many people are being killed
30	 @ LauraLovesBuble it couldnt possibly be .  Describe this man
30	Incredible interactive music video for Like a Rolling Stone on Bob Dylans website 
30	 @ irutsun

30	 @ elodiecheam Salut
30	 @ neilkilbride the order in which it is happening in that pic . 
30	 @ neilkilbride I would .  All of those . 
30	 @ FriendlyTester its fine if this is how he feels ,  its not for everyone .  Im just not interested in working with him . 
30	 @ FriendlyTester a teams responsibilities go beyond delivering good software ,  they must also ensure theyll be even more effective in future
30	 @ samwessel the lesson is ,  as bad as it might be for you and your night ,  its worse for  @ neilkilbride
30	 @ samwessel  @ neilkilbride 
30	 @ samwessel in case you missed it :

30	 @ caro  @ paullyoung theres a talk on operating a global in here somewhere  :  ) 
30	 @ caro  @ paullyoung are you aware that the UK definition of pants is different to the US definition ? 
30	 @ FriendlyTester  @ geoffalove  @ J _ Jezza it felt like a long shot !  We had a lovely meal nonetheless . 
30	The devs ,  customers of your API ,  are all of differing ability ,  some require more help than others ,  but where do you draw the line ?   # BAPI2013
30	How do we know we can trust the sources ,  the assumptions and interpretation of the data behind a data visualisation ?   # BAPI2013
30	Seeing  @ mccandelish talk at  # BAPI2013 .  I keep thinking  "  @ EdThink would bloody love this .  " 
30	Great view of London from the  # BAPI2013 conference venue
