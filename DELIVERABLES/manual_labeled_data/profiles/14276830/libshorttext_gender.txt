-1	Color scheme after moving to VS 2010 and R #  5 . 1 are making my eyes bleed .  Ouch . 
-1	 @ ferventcoder A monkey wrench and a good book arent that expensive though  :  ) 
-1	Upgrading to VS 2010 /  . NET 4 ,   MVC 3 beta  ( straight from MVC 1 )  ,  and latest Spark build all at the same time .  This should be fun .  .  .

-1	 @ DavidGood  Sounds like youll be running around like a chicken with its head cut off . 
-1	 @ JustinEtheredge Im seeing the speed issues with Google Apps recently too .  Getting annoying . 
-1	 @ JimHolmes I know holding in the shift key messes it up  ( at least in the version Im running )  . 
-1	How do you get tests to explain the  " why "  for complex scenarios ?  Easy to see what they do ,  but tough to explain in test / context names alone . 
-1	 @ DavidGood WinSnap

-1	 @ DavidGood Precursor to VAT ?  I think so . 
-1	Freakin  @ orbitz  .  Pretty much every flight selection is met with  " Were sorry , due to changes .  .  "  blah blah .  Update your database more often !

-1	RT :  Were looking for a  . NET developer in Canton ,  OH .  
-1	Great  # c4mvc presentation  @ BradWilson ! 
-1	I loves me some Solution Wide analysis w / R #  ,  but hate waiting for that initial scan after branching for a new feature  :  ( 
-1	 @ JonKruger A base context for an NUnit spec would require you to remember a base . context (  )  call .  MSpec doesnt .  Small ,  but everything helps . 
-1	 @ lautzenheiser Ill keep that in mind  :  ) 
-1	 @ lautzenheiser Not 100 %  sure ,  but I believe different project .  Theyd be sitting right next to us though .
