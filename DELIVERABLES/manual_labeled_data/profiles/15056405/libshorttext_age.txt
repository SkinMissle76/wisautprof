-0.46	How can I stop Capifony running  ` composer update `  instead of  ` composer install `  ,  seems odd default behaviour ? 
-0.46	Good old Varnish ‘set req . http . X - Forwarded - Port’ combined with Symfony’s ‘trust _ proxy _ headers’ fixes my port - in - the - redirect issue .  Super . 
-0.46	 @ CSwain1991 Yeah theyre often useless by themselves ,  but good starting points for making a site responsive because theyre quick and lean . 
-0.46	Same problem as getting m .  mobile versions of sites on here .  Stretched but tiny .  Needs to be actually responsive .  Easy ! 
-0.46	Fluid Android apps that stretch but arent optimised for my particular tablet feel really shoddy .  .  . 
-0.46	 @ rob _ squires Tidy work sir . 
-0.46	Pretty darn excited about these big cycling budget announcements .  Watch the house prices soar in these mini - Hollands . 
-0.46	 @ dbushell NERD

-0.46	 @ stevenjack85 Just trying to play around with Octopress etc for a site / blog .  Really shouldnt have cause me that much grief ! 
-0.46	Only bloody rvm install 1 . 9 . 3 - p392  -  - with - openssl - dir =  ` brew  -  - prefix openssl `  to the rescue . 
-0.46	Can Octopress defeat me twice in two evenings ? 
-0.46	 @ laurenredhead Hah just some geekery and poor musical choices ,  nothing new . 
-0.46	Super impressed with Google Play too ,  finally I can stream Surrender to the Blender at work ! 
-0.46	Picked myself up a Nexus 7 as a result of the Responsive Day Out .  Eye - opening for page weight / performance testing . 
-0.46	Our current favourite story tool  @ pivotaltracker is getting a new design ,  backbone . js build ,  and json api .  Sounds good . 
-0.46	 @ hackneyliving Cheers ! 
-0.46	Hello  @ hackneyliving ,  please could you grit / salt Pitfield St cycle lane tomorrow if possible ?  Thank you ! 
-0.46	Couldn’t be more relaxed .  Post - snowboard - lesson beers .  Cheers !

-0.46	 @ Daylight _ Music Some social media cake please  ( if you have any left )  !  Fourth row from the front ,  left - hand side  :  ) 
-0.46	First foray into social media cake  ( Cake2 . 0 ?  )  with  @ gaffafoote a resounding success .  Thanks  @ Daylight _ Music !  
-0.46	 @ CSwain1991 Heh will do  :  )  I think he reads it but doesn’t update it very often .  Will log in and have a look ! 
-0.46	Peak office bicycle capacity reached .  A good thing .  And clearly an excuse to buy a winter - proof  @ workcycles
-0.46	Somewhat sloppy carousel on the  # typescript home page .  I clearly don’t read quickly enough . 
-0.46	Chuckling at the LaTeX Memoir class’s  \ sloppybottom command . 
-0.46	 @ jackherbert Cheers ,  yeah just gave that a go ,  much quicker ,  and no Gary Numan ! 
-0.46	Really hope  @ o2 can help me today  :  (  Need a PAC ,  been sat on hold for hours over past few days .  Prepared for 8 hours on hold today . 
-0.46	‘Signed for by Consignee’ .  Now I just need to get down to Folkestone to pick it up ! 
-0.46	 @ dbushell Ha maybe I shouldn’t be drinking 
-0.46	What are you talking about ?  Of course my employee appraisal form needs its own Git repository . 
-0.46	 @ OrangeHelpers Cheers Steve .  Do you know of any way round this ,  e . g .  taking my passport etc .  into an Orange shop to authorise it ? 
-0.46	 @ OrangeHelpers Ok great thanks !  2nd Q :  Am I able to change my iPhone5 delivery address to my office  ( not card address )  ? 
-0.46	 @ OrangeHelpers Hello ,  I’ve pre - ordered a new iPhone with you ,  will I still be able to trade in my old one somehow ? 
-0.46	 @ Orangeuk Hello ,  I’ve pre - ordered a new iPhone with you ,  will I still be able to trade in my old one somehow ? 
-0.46	The O2 account - cancellation hotline doesn’t seem very well staffed this morning ! 
-0.46	 @ Orangeuk Will do ,  thanks .  Looking forward to seeing what you can offer me to win me  ( back )  from O2…
-0.46	Unable to register with GP because I don’t have proof of address .  Increasingly - common problem with ‘paperless’ statements . 
-0.46	To register interest in the iPhone5 with  @ Orangeuk you have to explicitly opt in to receiving marketing from them ! 
-0.46	 @ Natalie _ Rauh Sarkastischen Augenbrauen
-0.46	Good job I didn’t just announce that in public . 
-0.46	Disaster !  Plans to have an iPhone - announcement geek - in with beer at the office have been thwarted by cleaners .  Are they showing it on Sky ? 
-0.46	I’m now  ( slightly )  more inclined to keep the under - performing  @ virginmedia account at my current address .  See where proper service gets you ! 
-0.46	A call from  @ virginmedia I thought I’d never receive .  A polite ,  friendly rep calling off their hounds !  Account closed  :  )   / cc  @ laurenredhead
-0.46	 @ Natalie _ Rauh Ha 
-0.46	 @ Natalie _ Rauh Right ,  it’s going on again .  Pay attention  :  ) 
-0.46	 @ Natalie _ Rauh Yeah that’s not going to make any sense any more ,  ha ! 
-0.46	 @ Natalie _ Rauh Listen !  It’s in German  * and *  it’s HTML !  How exciting ! 
-0.46	Last time ,  the Red Arrows flew directly out of a television and over our heads .  Got a bit excited .  Definitely hadn’t been drinking . 
-0.46	 @ virginmedia I’d also be hugely grateful if you could chase up Social Media Enquiry No .  182673 .  Thank you . 
-0.46	 @ virginmedia This morning’s status unknown so far .  Bit upset I had to spend £s on coffee shop wifi all day yesterday to get work done . 
-0.46	Good morning !  Up early to carry on my coursework .  Except  @ virginmedia isn’t working . 
-0.46	Eight 
-0.46	Beautiful cycle down to E & amp ; C .  Time for a quick coffee before a day of bicycles at  # CAMSconf Not too shabby ! 
-0.46	 # GRLDN 
-0.46	After 27 years ,  I’ve only just discovered dishwashers can be opened while operating .  What kind of UX is that anyway ?   # steamy
-0.46	 @ laurenredhead What is Utrecht like ?  I’d quite like to go . 
-0.46	 @ laurenredhead Chess on boats is responsible for 70 %  of canal deaths in the Netherlands . 
-0.46	 @ laurenredhead No chess
-0.46	‘This wouldn’t have been a problem if they had used sub - window antialiasing . ’  :  )  
-0.46	 @ virginmedia They simply insist that the fee is valid ,  despite explicitly communicating otherwise before . 
-0.46	 @ virginmedia Your phone rep confirmed it was your mistake and apologised for it—which I am grateful for—but still demanded the fee . 
-0.46	 @ virginmedia I moved house 1 . 5 mths ago ,  and was told everything was paid off  ( actually £5 in credit )  .  Now debt collectors after another £30
-0.46	 .  @ virginmedia are trying to retrospectively  ( and very forcefully )  apply a charge I was explicitly told didn’t exist . 
-0.46	Absolutely astonished by  @ virginmedia ’s tactics .  I couldn’t be more offended by their customer service . 
-0.46	 @ daaain Yeah that’d be good ,  cheers ,  I’ve left a message on the forum . 
-0.46	 @ mugloch Cheers ! 
-0.46	 @ mugloch Ok nice one ,  I’ll add it to the list ;  always after  ( not tooooo heavy )  suggestions ! 
-0.46	It may be a legitimate call ,  but if you phone and ask my address before you even mention your company ,  you won’t get an answer ! 
-0.46	 @ mugloch I can’t tell if this is a serious suggestion or just alphabet - based humour !  Or both  :  ) 
-0.46	Finally finished Foucault’s Pendulum ! 
-0.46	 @ daaain Hi ,  thought I’d say a quick hello as another London - based web person signed up to the Coursera Sustainability course . 
-0.46	Sitting in the Covent Garden Apple store ,  trying to kill my misbehaving iMac .  Will !  Not !  Replicate ! 
-0.46	Typekit’s trying its best to make me fall for Jubilat all over again .
