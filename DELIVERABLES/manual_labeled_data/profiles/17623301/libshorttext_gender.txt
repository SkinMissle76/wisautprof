-1	 @ bagwaa gitgutter plugin for ST  :  ) 
-1	 @ bagwaa it never hurts to experiment  :  )  I tried PHPstorm for a while ,  but all the underlining and background colours drove me nuts . 
-1	 @ kking724 haha ,  enjoy  :  ) 
-1	 @ bagwaa you can with plug ins ,  but I do most of that stuff in the CLI or with build scripts . 
-1	 @ seldaek its a sign of a community doing well .  Someone always has to have a dig when things are going swimmingly .   : P
-1	 @ bagwaa I dont get on with PHPstorm ,  my mood is changed by the design of things ,  and PHPstorm feels kinda ugly .  I miss the IDE features tho
