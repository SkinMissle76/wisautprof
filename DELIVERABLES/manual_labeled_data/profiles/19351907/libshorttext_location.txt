17	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough good to see youve not lost your rage Wacko  :  ) 
17	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough  .  .  . and having met both Gene and Patrick am happily assured of their integrity .  Haters gonna hate .  .  . 
17	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough  " just doing youre job "  ,  like its ever that straightforward .  I for one am getting a lot from devops .  .  . 
17	 @ patrickdebois nice try  :  -  )  I do not share the nausea ! 
17	 @ danrough  @ mwjacks0n Gen Kim is the father of DevOps  ( along with Patrick Debois )  so I think thats a bit of a disservice
17	 @ danrough  @ mwjacks0n This post from Gene Kim on The Principles underpinning DevOps is good 
17	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough who says ?  In my experience DevOps is more cultural than tech  ( just like Agile )  . 
17	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough in fact devops has even fewer tangible points of ref .   ( e . g .  agile manifesto )  so more likely to get abused . 
17	 @ mwjacks0n  @ danrough devops no more technical than agile .  Already being diluted and name checked by higher echelons .

17	 @ Stoertebeker480 I dont disagree with Martins point ,  but we do get value from what were doing and thats all that matters to me . 
17	 @ Stoertebeker480 depends what you mean by productivity I guess  :  )  Not an easy conversation to have on twitter . 
17	 @ Stoertebeker480 its not important to me .  I want to see wider long term trends for general improvement in our ability to deliver
17	 @ Stoertebeker480 I think I get what youre sayong and I agree .   A feature  !  =  business value .  But the productivity  & amp ;  value not the same thing
