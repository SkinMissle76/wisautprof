-0.56	Today was long .  I need to go to bed .   :  ) 
-0.56	Having kids shouldnt be thought of as a burden ,  but rather ,  a chance to pass down your beliefs , and form a work of art that is a good person
-0.56	People think raising children is a chore ,  no its not .  Its a blessing .  Stop thinking of it as work ,  its not  " work "  ,  its your legacy . 
-0.56	I hate when I take over a post with comments ,  and then someone else chimes in with a 1 word comment ,  and kills the whole convo I was having . 
-0.56	 @ borbyterror Ive become better at holding it in ,  but as a result I just dont talk to anyone anymore .  Hahaha

-0.56	I need to let some things go ,  and stop holding grudges .  I miss not freaking out over everything and anything .  I want to care less again .   :  ) 
-0.56	some things suck .  And once they get good again ,  its hard to think that it will stay good .  Its living in fear of the past that sucks .
