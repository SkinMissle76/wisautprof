3	 @ khurammalik Cheers ,  appreciate the praise  :  ) 
3	So ,  I just wrote a CI server using  @ docker  .  .  .  That was easier than I thought !  I cant wait to get it in a releasable state for other to use
3	Had a mild panic attack that my VPS was owned ,  because I found this image in  / tmp 
3	I talk like a northern monkey ,  but whats the deal with people just ignoring half my sentences ?  They just wait until its their turn to talk
3	 @ mnowster Pretty sure this is the most broken rule ever .  Maybe second to  " cotton buds must not be inserted into the ear "

3	 @ LoonyPandora And yes ,  it is a dodgy HD stream of the BT sport coverage .  .  .  Why the BT sport website doesnt work properly Ill never know .  .  . 
3	Great ,  BT Sport is so totally useless ,  choppy and slow ,  Im watching a dodgy stream rather than the service I actually pay for .  .  . 
3	Someone was asking for my slides from last year at  # lpw2013  -  but I didnt get any details .  Hope they read hashtags !  
3	Feeling mega inadequate next to some awesome people .  Should pull my finger out and do something that matters rather than half - assed code . 
3	 @ yaili It should be  " width = device - width "  and youve got  " width - device - width "   :  )  
3	 @ yaili Very nice ,  I like your good things page ,  and the ASCII art in the source .  You have a typo in your viewport meta - tag though  ( nitpick ) 
3	Just one of those days where nothing works .  Every tool ,  every 3rd party API ,  everything is just totally  & amp ;  utterly broken .  Burn it all . 
3	 @ cackhanded Also ,  a few of the JS questions on there are wrong ,  as I found out when I cheated and ran the question code in the console .  .  . 
3	 @ chessqueen What happened to your podcasts ?  I love listening to them ,  but they havent been updated in ages .  Please start recording again  :  ) 
3	Lazyweb :  Whats the legality with apps that use your Facebook data  ( inc photos )  to make shadow profiles before you sign up for a service ? 
3	 @ OvidPerl my point being ;  if its so hard for so many smart people to intuitively understand  & amp ;  do  -  is it even the right concept ? 
3	 @ OvidPerl Perhaps that shows fundamental problems with the models used by test suites  & amp ;  languages ,  rather than bad company / devs / tools ? 
3	 @ builtinperl  @ LoonyPandora Thats a compliment btw .  Im really really impressed . 
3	 @ BuiltinPerl The site  & amp ;  branding across social networks looks great !  Im genuinely shocked that something perl related actually looks good ! 
3	Asked to  " put the kettle on "  .  5 mins later  " wheres my cup of tea ?  "   -  Thats not what you asked for .  .  .  Need to be specific with a programmer

3	 @ panic A suggestion ,  could you link to the changelog in tweets like this ?  Perhaps I should read better ,  but I clicked  & amp ;  got an unexpect DL . 
3	 @ HurriDan Fair one ,  its more detailed than explainable in a few tweets .  Was asking to get the opinion of someone outside the echo - chamber . 
3	 @ HurriDan Interesting .  I thought it solved the ethical problems people have with meat ?  No life ,  killing ,  exploitation ,  etc . 
3	 @ HurriDan Ive been asking this of a few people lately ,  but whats your opinion on lab - grown meat / food ?  Ethical ?  Potentially world - changing ? 
3	 @ HurriDan I cant find the link ,  but consider the price of a 99p McDonalds burger and what goes in it .  Bread ,  Meat ,  Veg ,  etc . 
3	 @ HurriDan Whilst its probably mostly profit in this case ,  food production is deceptively expensive .  People dont pay the true cost . 
3	 @ NeilCrosby  @ o2 Its not just you .  I sense the internet outrage machine is about to be engaged . 
3	 @ GrahamPhillips _  They are extremely practical . 
3	That feeling when you wake up in the morning ,  and wonder why you left your browser open on the wikipedia page for Yurt .  .  .  . 
3	 @ PerlSawyer Cool .  I hope one day the perception of it changes .  My opinion on the morality of meat - eating is too nuanced for twitter btw . 
3	 @ PerlSawyer Whats your opinion on lab - grown meat ?  Genuinely curious ,  some people are icky about the thought  -  I think its a great idea . 
3	 @ DrHydeous  @ pacificrim Its a film about robots punching monsters in the face .  How could they screw that up ?  ? 
3	That last RT because I totally forgot Atlantic 252 existed .  Thought I was was special finding it while messing on the radio in the car . 
3	Only one thing could induce this much rage at 2 : 30am  -  JavaScript .  fucking JavaScript .  
3	node . js community :  In the boilerplate docs ,  make sure you actually replace the placeholders in with ,  yknow ,  THE ACTUAL MODULE INFORMATION ! 
3	 " the default options are used to do something with whatever "   -  Fucking ace documentation right there 
3	 @ Abablabab Yeah ,  a file called  " yourmum "   : P
3	 @ Abablabab Nope ,  thats one of the pages I was looking at .  Basically just says  " put these settings in a file "  .  I guessed in the end .  .  . 
3	Jeez ,  how hard is it to find an example of what format an  "  . npmrc "  file should be .  .  .  No examples on the doc page ,  and google comes up short . 
3	 @ rabenfeder Thats an awesome idea ,  thanks ! 
3	Im all 2 - factor - authed up the wazoo now .  After all the breaches over the past year or so ,  figured an update is worth the tiny extra hassle . 
3	 @ rowanmanning Niiiice !  In the words of Kimi Räikkönen :   " Leave me alone ,  I know what Im doing " 
3	 @ ianstormtaylor I find linkedin email previews do that .  If thats the latest email in your inbox ,  delete it via we mail ,  bobs your uncle ! 
3	 @ CommodoreDan Thats what triggered my tweet !  If it changed anything theyd make it illegal ,  yadda yadda ,  etc . 
3	Remember kids ,  its not civil disobedience if you do everything the police tell you to  & amp ;  only go where youre allowed . 
3	Scariest thing for a web developer to see .  .  .  
3	 @ almonk I did a talk last year about documentation .  A bit specific to Perl ,  but you can get the gist of it I think :  
3	I need to use this image more often when people mention bugs in my code .  
3	Mavericks memory management is much improved .  Uptime 5 days ,  played games ,  worked ,  compiled stuff .  .  .  Zero swap used .

3	 @ rowanmanning Of course .  Cant pass up free stuff and chatting to interesting people .  Maybe well actually end up having a beer this time ? 
3	 @ rowanmanning Im indifferent to most of it TBH .  Bit about  " conceptual incompatibilities "  spells out whats been grinding my gears for ages ! 
3	 @ rowanmanning Totally .  Any choice between methodologies is about compromise .  Having a dissenting voice helps devs understand the compromises
3	 @ rowanmanning For me ,  the takeaway is to think about the compromises youre making rather than just doing what someone on the internet says . 
3	This :   " conceptual incompatibilities between a declarative style language and object - oriented  [  .  .  .  ]  design principles "  
3	 @ jake74 No chance for permanent work .  Useful if youre freelance .  Sometimes Ive looked at their ad ,  worked out the company  & amp ;  applied direct
3	 @ CommodoreDan  @ peeessdoubleyou  @ lookdadnotunes 
3	 @ digbythefox Oh embarrassing memories .  I did the same on a yahoo group .  Thankfully not online now ,  but the internet archive remembers all .  .  . 
3	 @ Amytriptyline84 Getting there ,  thanks  :  ) 
3	 @ Amytriptyline84 Glad I dont have people to talk to at work !  I just worry about silly things like solving all the worlds problems  :  ( 
3	 @ Amytriptyline84 wrt  =  with regard to .  Too many abbreviations on here sometimes . 
3	Learned a lot by forcing myself out of my bubble wrt social issues .  But man is it triggering .  Have to give it up for own sanity . 
3	 @  _ AmandaFoley Only if you turn it on surely ?  Thats what I get from the article anyway .  I can see a use for it ,  as long as its default off . 
3	Totally just fell off the wagon and downed like ,  2 litres of Coke .  It wasnt even the caffeine free stuff either .

3	 @ PeeEssDoubleYou Get Ed Woodward on the phone .  If anyone can seal that deal its a shit Ian Hislop lookalike . 
3	 @ brain _ opera Yeah ,  its a bit dodgy on mine too .  Guess it just cant handle all the fanciness .  iOS7 is a bit buggy in general I find as well
3	 @ mxcl Perhaps .  .  .  Would be interesting to see how it pans out though  -  if it does actually go through . 
3	 @ mxcl Dunno man ,  Id get bored if I didnt do anything with my time .  Open Source stuff ,  etc .  Its an interesting social experiment IMHO . 
3	 @ Amytriptyline84 Its a totally accurate representation of what happened to my mind when I realised it is an n turn ! 
3	 @ Amytriptyline84 Wha .  .  .  .  That is .  .  .  Mind  =  =  Blown 
3	Does it annoy anyone else that the Apple winking emoji has the wrong eye winking ?   ;  )   =  =  right eye 😉  =  =  left eye . 
3	 @ bfirsh We should talk sometime .  Your thing is similar to the thing Ive been building ,  would be good to chat . 
3	Finally bit the bullet and bought an SSD .  Delivery next week .  Hope it lives up to the hype ! 
3	Playing GTA V ,  listening to  @ darren _ cullens band .  All good .  ♫ 
3	 @ HurriDan Dont have a problem with that .  The halloween costume didnt bother me either .  Like you say its a fiction ,  like a Mummy  /  Zombie . 
3	 @ CommodoreDan Fingers crossed for you .  Losing that much data is pretty awful .  My stuff is 3 . 4TB of accumulated junk from the past 10 years . 
3	 @ CommodoreDan Gutted for you man  :  (   -  Luckily I can get my data back ,  but it was a close call !

3	 @ Amytriptyline84 Aww man ,  I miss that show .  This is me quite often 
3	 @ chockenberry Always made sure to pronounce it as  " p - ram "  back in my support days for that very reason !  It actually fixed a problem .  Once . 
3	 @ mnowster Arts degree was pointless for me .  The degree part anyway .  Just immerse yourself if you have a passion .  Dont waste it in class . 
3	Looks like they dug the old one up from 1995 .  .  .  “ @ MerlinMason :  Wow ,  the new TSB website is dreadful —

3	So ,  I couldnt get BT Sport because BT didnt know my phone number .  How is that even possible ?

3	 @ DrHydeous Ill give it a shot .  I watched a YouTube video narrated by a Russian about how to smoke pipes .  I consider myself an expert now . 
3	 @ jamesronan I have a TV that I never actually use for watching TV .  Its a PS3 monitor essentially .  But I might ,  one day ,  watch TV on it .  .  .
