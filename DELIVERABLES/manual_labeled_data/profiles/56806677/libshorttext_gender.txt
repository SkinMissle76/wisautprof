-1	 @ LiquidReZZ depends if youre a middle aged ,  middle class housewife ,  otherwise its obviously Southern Comfort

-1	 @ MichelleFlynn  @ huddle  @ 7digital theres definitely some cheese involved .  Otherwise itd be  # beerclub ,  now theres an idea .  .  . 
-1	 @ MichelleFlynn  @ huddle  @ 7digital Ive got one from the East Midlands and one mainly consisting of beer  -  also a description of me . 
-1	 @ Podgeypoos79  @ tonyrogerson sounds like Im going to have to think of ways for you to earn it .  You done those reports yet ? 
-1	 @ cam _ sf would have gone for either .  My favourite is a pros spare cos you know its well treated and hardly used .  Refurbs have warranty tho
-1	 @ will _ james heres a little linky to sort your phone out 
-1	 @ AnthonySteele and quite a fun sport too
-1	 @ AnthonySteele one of their main UK distribution centres is in Bedford with mainly fields between it and my house .  Hope its real ,  doubt it .

-1	 @ gemtriesharder yeah !  Only on Saturday though .  Ill be there with a tall Welshman ,  my lovely wife and my little boy in a pushchair . 
-1	 @ Paulswilliamsuk wouldnt it ?  It would be compelling to watch progress once a week .  Better than the current rehash offering  # leanapprentice
-1	 @ ntcoding are you volunteering to coordinate that ?  Nice one ,  youll do well . 
-1	 @ ntcoding they did .  Dan looked at catalogue matching algorithms and Chris wrote his own unit testing framework for chrome plugins

-1	 @ Paulswilliamsuk met a guy recently who writes GPS tracking software for cars .  His UAT is in the car park .  Bit of a feedback loop there too

-1	 @ henryoswald were having a graduation party at the office tomorrow for the Academy .  5pm in the atrium .  Would be grand if you can join us . 
-1	 @ sharelatex sounds like a great feature .  Academics I know love drop box for sharing and versioning ,  will have to get them to use LaTeX more
-1	 @ MAA1  " expert programmer "  over  " broad distributor "   -  good idea ,  shame the media are still fixated on vanity metrics of quantity over quality

-1	 @ Podgeypoos79  @ robbowley  @ gregsochanik clearly a fake ,  everyone knows I dont drink coffee .  Also I appear to be programming .  Never happened
-1	 @ robbowley  @ kevinrutherford that tiny cup is throwing the perspective off  @ gregsochanik is really that big .   # internetfamous
-1	 @ johnC _ bristol no problem .  I joined a mailing list recently that discusses similar stuff set up by a friend in Mcr :  
-1	 @ MarkDalgarno theres a place near the Grafton centre ,  down Fair Street called Nobby  & amp ;  I .  Tiny ,  inexpensive and great craftsmanship

-1	 @ samwessel that one was from  @ tonydenyer at the most recent 7digital cheese club .  He had 2 others ,  obviously not as memorable though
-1	 @ samwessel which cheeses drift through an open window ?  Light Bries  / cc  @ rubygem
-1	 @ Paulswilliamsuk  @ JohnnoNolan indeed .  Been using it in production for some time .  Simple ,  logical ,  extensible .  Ousted openrasta and nancyfx
-1	 @ MatStace bet you didnt look weird taking pictures in the underwear section of Sainsburys
-1	Watching my old mate  @ samwessel give a talk in Nottingham while Im on the train from London .  Very geeky ,  even for  @ geekupnotts
-1	 @ samwessel you can definitely make it do that .  The paths that reveal stuff are arbitrary and can include sounds . 
-1	 @ samwessel with a pixelated font and prezi you could probably do similar with little effort
-1	 @ robbowley  @ kevinrutherford considered the mini for my wife too ,  her sister has a Huawei which she likes .

-1	 @ kaminskipawel are you coming to Devs in the Ditch on Thursday ?  Im speaking about our apprenticeships and technical academy . 
-1	 @ ChrisAnnODell I saw the panicking staff .  It was actually the back of the train .  Plenty of police around too . 
-1	 @ ChrisAnnODell southbound tube line had someone injured near front of train .  Saw aftermath while going north after getting on at moorgate .
