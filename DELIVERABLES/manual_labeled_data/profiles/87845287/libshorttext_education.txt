3	Fire Emblem not having a lot of success on Awesome Games Done Quick .  To be honest ,  its boring to watch . 
3	In case your day didnt start well :  
3	 @ tobie To be perfectly honest ,  even if it gets acquired ,  it is far more usable and powerful than a Sparrow for example . 
3	 @ tobie It is definitely worth much more ,  but the developers are just too nice with them .  Give me your thoughts once youll have tried it . 
3	Flying in helicopter is definitely not safe ,  after last month Glasgow accident ,  a new one in Norfolk  :  /

3	 @ tobie Ahah ,  the situation is not great but at least its the beginning of a solution .  I dont see a viable alternative any time soon .

3	This Super Mario World 3D is just awesome .  It justifies on its own buying a  # WiiU ,  you wont find that anywhere else . 
3	And Arsenal with a 7 points lead ,  that feels good ! 
3	Just bought Super Mario 3D World ,  the clerk asked me if it was for my little brother .  Guess a 28 years old has to play GTA or COD .

3	 @ JM _ Aulas sans faire le grincheux ,  cest quand même décevant de voir que lon doit de satisfaire de la situation actuelle .  LOL vaut mieux . 
3	 @ Bitdefender more details :  stop showing popups for extending the licence .  Small notif in the notification area or after a scan would do ! 
3	Apple stupidity :  Download Mavericks ,  close installer because you dont want to install it now .  You need to download it again next time .  .  . 
3	 @ Bitdefender Youre not helping your case when I have actually just told you what was the issue .  I dont want spam when using my PC . 
3	Ca fait mal de voir Lyon se contentait dun 1 - 0 ,  on est vraiment fébrile .  Enfin bon ,  une victoire ,  enfin . 
3	When you have bought  # bitdefender ,  you also have to endure their stupid pop ups asking you to extend your licence .  Ill switch to smtg else .

3	 @ La _ FF I am convinced that Valve has a good strategy betting on Linux for the future of gaming .  What they announced so far sounds good ! 
3	Eligible for Steam Box .  Would be awesome to be one of the first to embrace the future of video games on PC . 
3	 # GMail is horribly slow right now . 
3	The feature I miss from  # osx when using another OS  ( such as Linux )  is pairing network interfaces with different proxies .  Highly convenient . 
3	Google has a strong grip on  # android :  nothing new ,  but interesting to see the big picture of Googles strategy :  
3	Pinterest has supposedly replaced bookmarks ,  giving it a go . 
3	One game away from 50 %  win rate at Dota 2 ,  lets rock ! 
3	Un titre inimaginable il y a quelques années :  
3	 @ detronizator So you actually put stuff on Twitter just to get the approval of others ,  and dismiss criticism . 
3	 @ detronizator Why would you put that in a gist ?  I dont think you have proven anything through your answer ,  or through this ,  a bit pathetic . 
3	Windows can get complicated :  Had English US in language bar ,  despite no US keyboard setup .  Had to add it and remove it to get rid of it .  .  .
