-0.3	Come on palace .  Try having a shot . 
-0.3	 @ b1ip Roman is hopeless but I like Sergio ,  hes not afraid to race unlike the rest of them cruising round

-0.3	Hmm somethings missing from my car  ( front and back )

-0.3	 @ eedeebee  @ fostercharles thx Eric ,  am thinking of just retiring my api site now yours is better .  Got some ideas for qconsole  -  ill email u
-0.3	 @ fostercharles had a quick try but the XML isnt available like it used to be .  and the ml docs arent so bad now anyway . 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n  @ b1ip watched primer again the other night .  Still dont really get it but doesnt really matter
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n  @ RichMartin42 ah the glory days .  Doug mountfield !  Had a poster of that when I was 8 I guess . 
-0.3	mba is refusing to charge again so using last of battery to back everything up .  2 weeks of warranty left  :  ) 
-0.3	 @ RichMartin42  @ N1ckMart1n could just tell tiger was gonna bottle that putt .  Not the same man anymore
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n just incredible .  Last month I said nothing beats tennis for drama ,  I was wrong ! 
-0.3	week 2 of scala course done  ( after some serious head scratching ) 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n haha !  poor old emile .  .  .  but think id rather have a sydney shirt with Piero on . 
-0.3	 @ billtrippe its growing slowly but still a tiny community .  Hence MarkLogic de - emphasising it lately . 
-0.3	 @ jm2dev muchas gracias  :  ) 
-0.3	4 - 2 to Everton right ?  For the rest of the season Ill be adding 2 points to our total . 
-0.3	 @ xquery its a good thing  :  ) 
-0.3	time to retire 
-0.3	 @ quii but truth is native apps are better .  HTML is a compromise on quality / features for sake of simplicity
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n yep ,  some of it was just unbelievable .  No baseline drive - volleys though  :  ( 
-0.3	Wow ,  murray was incredible .  cant beat tennis for drama . 
-0.3	 @ quii might be useful for your spike :  
-0.3	compare and contrast .  .  .  
-0.3	 @ RichMartin42  @ N1ckMart1n doubt spurs ,  liverpool or everton will be anywhere near top 4 .  .  .  fight for 6th maybe ,  but early days ! 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n yeah thats the excitement over  -  were 7th and will probably finish 7th . 
-0.3	I love football again  :  ) 
-0.3	 @ quii all 3 ?  Uglify will probably just leave it as is  :  ) 
-0.3	 @ jm2dev  @ quii tl ; dr better than apple
-0.3	Time to park the bus
-0.3	well it was asking a lot for the whole olympics to be amazing . 
-0.3	Bit late with this but fantastic testimonial goal for Tony  " He scores when he wants "  Hibbert 
-0.3	forgot its the charity shield today ,  turned on to see terry and cole arguing with ref .  switched back to olympics . 
-0.3	russell brand v peter hitchens on newsnight is a must see on iplayer .  unbelievable how some peoples minds work . 
-0.3	 @ jm2dev plus im still secretly hoping winfs is reborn  :  ) 
-0.3	 @ jm2dev was interested until I saw the setup process .  .  . 
-0.3	 @ quii that last retweet could easily be applied to laptops  :  ) 
-0.3	Just finished season 4 of breaking bad .  Brilliant .  Best tv since sopranos and the wire . 
-0.3	Loved it . 
-0.3	 @ quii good article on the limitations of responsive design  -  exactly what we were talking about .  .  .  
-0.3	update :   @ O2 still suck

-0.3	O2 suck
-0.3	 @ hartberg I think we got away with the cocktails .  And managed to sort out the Olympics  -  I look forward to the double jump and beach 100m . 
-0.3	Phil Brown  -  remember him ?  
-0.3	 @ RichMartin42  @ N1ckMart1n cant take Rooney off !  Young was shit the while game .  But at least the germans cant beat us now .  . 
-0.3	taking torres off when game is bound to get more stretched was a strange one .  croatia really could win this .  .  . 
-0.3	 ( slightly biased )  prediction :  jelavic to score winner  # coyb
-0.3	Tsonga is having the game of his life .  think he needs to take it in this tie break though . 
-0.3	Djokovic just refusing to be beaten ,  incredible stuff from both players
-0.3	 @ RichMartin42 what could be ?   :  ) 
-0.3	damn .  last week I missed the marklogic meetup ,  and just realised Im meant to be at the riak one tonight .  wonder what else Ive forgotten
-0.3	 @ mikeyhu lego makes men do strange things .  .  
-0.3	Terrys got his kit on !  what an idiot . 
-0.3	wise words “ @ souders :   " Web First for Mobile "  Start building a mobile web presence before working on native apps .  
-0.3	 @ fostercharles nice one ,  let me know if you find any problems or have suggestions . 
-0.3	 @ quii its called dayparting in marketing bullshit speak .  And it sucks . 
-0.3	 @ quii this might be more useful for scala anyway 
-0.3	 @ quii would be rude not to do it in scala too then .  I started in clojure but didnt know what the hell i was doing
-0.3	 @ quii reckon js with underscore . js would be good for euler .  Or stick to coffeescript obviously…
-0.3	Fast ,  easy ,  realtime metrics using Redis bitmaps 
-0.3	 @ quii  @ jm2dev but its just so beautiful  :  ) 
-0.3	 @ jm2dev thanks  -  github have got a new feature that generates it all for you .  .  
-0.3	 @ markhneedham  @ quii Mark you must still be committing on the sly !  At this rate i wont catch up until 2015
-0.3	ok fours enough ,  save some for next weekend  # coyb
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n funny .  .  alliss and co keep subtly hinting that hes not actually very good .  right im off ,  cant bear to watch all the ceremony
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n hasnt aged in the last 20 years . 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n thatll do ! 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n time for some heroic hook from bubba .  .  . 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n hope that ridiculous driver is for charity or something .  ouch two wild drives .  .  could be here all night at this rate . 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n have to admit i drifted off for the last few holes… not the most thrilling finale
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n no !  !  ! 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n Id take 3 putts for par from there
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n yeah he is good ,  great gig if you can get it .  shame about donald ,  pretty embarrassing when youre meant to be  # 1 . 
-0.3	 @ N1ckMart1n how hes bbcs chief football writer is beyond me . 
-0.3	 @ quii yeah thats the one .  never actually tried it tho .  Or you can get an EC2 server free for a year . 
-0.3	 @ quii not so far .  waiting for inspiration to strike .  . 
-0.3	 @ hunterhacker ok thanks
-0.3	Does MarkLogic not do tail recursion optimisation ?   Trying to do the project euler problems and getting stack overflows  :  ( 
-0.3	 @ mikeyhu  @ quii scala sunspots  :  )  
-0.3	 @ quii ok ,  tomorrow maybe .  Im done for the night . 
-0.3	 @ quii so cs does something special with invalid array indexes ?  In js youd get undefined and would break the summing I think .
