3	Blockbuster video in Chesterfield is closing ,  they announced it by taking down the sign that says  " Holy shit how are we still open ?  ?  " 
3	 @ MrChaz Amazon 
3	 @ jna _ sh yeah ,  that side works ok ,  not as good as just plugging an HDMI cable in though . 
3	 @ jna _ sh really great for  @ NetflixUK  & amp ;   @ YouTube on my TV ,  does bugger all else though

3	I just saw Gravity ,  my mind went supernova .  Were all still talking about this film ,  right ?   .  .  .  Riiiiight ?   .  .  .  Guys ?   .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .   & lt ; beep & gt ; 
3	 @ ruby _ gem what ?  Why are you saying this ? 
3	 @ firagabeatsrock innit . 
3	 .  @ northernrailorg so the company that runs the train is not able to affect the condition of the train ?  Who signed this lease agreement ?  ? 
3	 @ northernrailorg thats not an excuse ,  you are responsible for the quality of your own service .  If that service is bad you must address it . 
3	 @ northernrailorg why not renovate them ?  This is the corroded old toilet on this train .  Your passengers are people !  
3	 @ northernrailorg Why is the state of your trains are so much worse than other train companies ?  The Notts - Leeds trains are filthy . 
3	 @ firagabeatsrock the conversation it is a part of is still in active development . 
3	 @ firagabeatsrock we already discussed why this statement isnt true .

3	 @ FriendlyTester its fine if this is how he feels ,  its not for everyone .  Im just not interested in working with him . 
3	 @ FriendlyTester a teams responsibilities go beyond delivering good software ,  they must also ensure theyll be even more effective in future
3	 @ samwessel the lesson is ,  as bad as it might be for you and your night ,  its worse for  @ neilkilbride

3	 @ FriendlyTester  @ geoffalove  @ J _ Jezza it felt like a long shot !  We had a lovely meal nonetheless . 
3	The devs ,  customers of your API ,  are all of differing ability ,  some require more help than others ,  but where do you draw the line ?   # BAPI2013
3	How do we know we can trust the sources ,  the assumptions and interpretation of the data behind a data visualisation ?   # BAPI2013
3	Seeing  @ mccandelish talk at  # BAPI2013 .  I keep thinking  "  @ EdThink would bloody love this .  "
