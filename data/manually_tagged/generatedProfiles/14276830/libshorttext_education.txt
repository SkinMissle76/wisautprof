3	 @ lautzenheiser  @ ErickNave Stop by sometime to see the benefits .  Itll help convince you  :  )  Carnivore Club  ? 
3	 @ DarrellMozingo Might be worth looking into something like Typemock .  Im recommending it for another team here that has no tests . 
3	 @ lautzenheiser If its an app that ppl depend on and is actively worked on ,  .  its worth the time for tests .   
3	Whats the best way to let clients plug their own IoC container into your framework ?  CSL ?  Custom interface ?  Hard code my pref  &  screw um ?   :  )

3	 @ patrik _ hagne Sweet ,  thanks for the tip !   Any way to filter if x . TheMemberYouWantCallsFor (  )  takes an argument ?

3	Color scheme after moving to VS 2010 and R #  5 . 1 are making my eyes bleed .  Ouch . 
3	 @ ferventcoder A monkey wrench and a good book arent that expensive though  :  ) 
3	Upgrading to VS 2010 /  . NET 4 ,   MVC 3 beta  ( straight from MVC 1 )  ,  and latest Spark build all at the same time .  This should be fun .  .  .

3	 @ ferventcoder Yea .  Its mostly a matter of ripping it out of our current project and tweaking it . 
3	 @ ferventcoder Later this summer ?  
3	Trying to act like a hip Web 2 . 0 company and failing miserably is worse than just acting like an uptight old company in the first place . 
3	 @ DavidGood  Sounds like youll be running around like a chicken with its head cut off . 
3	 @ JustinEtheredge Im seeing the speed issues with Google Apps recently too .  Getting annoying . 
3	 @ JimHolmes I know holding in the shift key messes it up  ( at least in the version Im running )  . 
3	How do you get tests to explain the  " why "  for complex scenarios ?  Easy to see what they do ,  but tough to explain in test / context names alone .

3	 @ JonKruger A base context for an NUnit spec would require you to remember a base . context (  )  call .  MSpec doesnt .  Small ,  but everything helps . 
3	 @ lautzenheiser Ill keep that in mind  :  ) 
3	 @ lautzenheiser Not 100 %  sure ,  but I believe different project .  Theyd be sitting right next to us though .
