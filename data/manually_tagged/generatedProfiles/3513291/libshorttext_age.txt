-0.5	Had a mild panic attack that my VPS was owned ,  because I found this image in  / tmp 
-0.5	I talk like a northern monkey ,  but whats the deal with people just ignoring half my sentences ?  They just wait until its their turn to talk

-0.5	 @ LoonyPandora And yes ,  it is a dodgy HD stream of the BT sport coverage .  .  .  Why the BT sport website doesnt work properly Ill never know .  .  . 
-0.5	Great ,  BT Sport is so totally useless ,  choppy and slow ,  Im watching a dodgy stream rather than the service I actually pay for .  .  . 
-0.5	Someone was asking for my slides from last year at  # lpw2013  -  but I didnt get any details .  Hope they read hashtags !  
-0.5	Feeling mega inadequate next to some awesome people .  Should pull my finger out and do something that matters rather than half - assed code . 
-0.5	 @ yaili It should be  " width = device - width "  and youve got  " width - device - width "   :  )  
-0.5	 @ yaili Very nice ,  I like your good things page ,  and the ASCII art in the source .  You have a typo in your viewport meta - tag though  ( nitpick ) 
-0.5	Just one of those days where nothing works .  Every tool ,  every 3rd party API ,  everything is just totally  & amp ;  utterly broken .  Burn it all . 
-0.5	 @ cackhanded Also ,  a few of the JS questions on there are wrong ,  as I found out when I cheated and ran the question code in the console .  .  .

-0.5	Lazyweb :  Whats the legality with apps that use your Facebook data  ( inc photos )  to make shadow profiles before you sign up for a service ? 
-0.5	 @ OvidPerl my point being ;  if its so hard for so many smart people to intuitively understand  & amp ;  do  -  is it even the right concept ? 
-0.5	 @ OvidPerl Perhaps that shows fundamental problems with the models used by test suites  & amp ;  languages ,  rather than bad company / devs / tools ? 
-0.5	 @ builtinperl  @ LoonyPandora Thats a compliment btw .  Im really really impressed . 
-0.5	 @ BuiltinPerl The site  & amp ;  branding across social networks looks great !  Im genuinely shocked that something perl related actually looks good !

-0.5	 @ panic A suggestion ,  could you link to the changelog in tweets like this ?  Perhaps I should read better ,  but I clicked  & amp ;  got an unexpect DL . 
-0.5	 @ HurriDan Fair one ,  its more detailed than explainable in a few tweets .  Was asking to get the opinion of someone outside the echo - chamber . 
-0.5	 @ HurriDan Interesting .  I thought it solved the ethical problems people have with meat ?  No life ,  killing ,  exploitation ,  etc . 
-0.5	 @ HurriDan Ive been asking this of a few people lately ,  but whats your opinion on lab - grown meat / food ?  Ethical ?  Potentially world - changing ? 
-0.5	 @ HurriDan I cant find the link ,  but consider the price of a 99p McDonalds burger and what goes in it .  Bread ,  Meat ,  Veg ,  etc . 
-0.5	 @ HurriDan Whilst its probably mostly profit in this case ,  food production is deceptively expensive .  People dont pay the true cost . 
-0.5	 @ NeilCrosby  @ o2 Its not just you .  I sense the internet outrage machine is about to be engaged .

-0.5	 @ PerlSawyer Cool .  I hope one day the perception of it changes .  My opinion on the morality of meat - eating is too nuanced for twitter btw . 
-0.5	 @ PerlSawyer Whats your opinion on lab - grown meat ?  Genuinely curious ,  some people are icky about the thought  -  I think its a great idea . 
-0.5	 @ DrHydeous  @ pacificrim Its a film about robots punching monsters in the face .  How could they screw that up ?  ?

-0.5	Only one thing could induce this much rage at 2 : 30am  -  JavaScript .  fucking JavaScript .  
-0.5	node . js community :  In the boilerplate docs ,  make sure you actually replace the placeholders in with ,  yknow ,  THE ACTUAL MODULE INFORMATION ! 
-0.5	 " the default options are used to do something with whatever "   -  Fucking ace documentation right there 
-0.5	 @ Abablabab Yeah ,  a file called  " yourmum "   : P
-0.5	 @ Abablabab Nope ,  thats one of the pages I was looking at .  Basically just says  " put these settings in a file "  .  I guessed in the end .  .  . 
-0.5	Jeez ,  how hard is it to find an example of what format an  "  . npmrc "  file should be .  .  .  No examples on the doc page ,  and google comes up short . 
-0.5	 @ rabenfeder Thats an awesome idea ,  thanks ! 
-0.5	Im all 2 - factor - authed up the wazoo now .  After all the breaches over the past year or so ,  figured an update is worth the tiny extra hassle . 
-0.5	 @ rowanmanning Niiiice !  In the words of Kimi Räikkönen :   " Leave me alone ,  I know what Im doing " 
-0.5	 @ ianstormtaylor I find linkedin email previews do that .  If thats the latest email in your inbox ,  delete it via we mail ,  bobs your uncle !

-0.5	 @ rowanmanning Of course .  Cant pass up free stuff and chatting to interesting people .  Maybe well actually end up having a beer this time ? 
-0.5	 @ rowanmanning Im indifferent to most of it TBH .  Bit about  " conceptual incompatibilities "  spells out whats been grinding my gears for ages ! 
-0.5	 @ rowanmanning Totally .  Any choice between methodologies is about compromise .  Having a dissenting voice helps devs understand the compromises
-0.5	 @ rowanmanning For me ,  the takeaway is to think about the compromises youre making rather than just doing what someone on the internet says . 
-0.5	This :   " conceptual incompatibilities between a declarative style language and object - oriented  [  .  .  .  ]  design principles "  
-0.5	 @ jake74 No chance for permanent work .  Useful if youre freelance .  Sometimes Ive looked at their ad ,  worked out the company  & amp ;  applied direct

-0.5	 @ PeeEssDoubleYou Get Ed Woodward on the phone .  If anyone can seal that deal its a shit Ian Hislop lookalike . 
-0.5	 @ brain _ opera Yeah ,  its a bit dodgy on mine too .  Guess it just cant handle all the fanciness .  iOS7 is a bit buggy in general I find as well
-0.5	 @ mxcl Perhaps .  .  .  Would be interesting to see how it pans out though  -  if it does actually go through . 
-0.5	 @ mxcl Dunno man ,  Id get bored if I didnt do anything with my time .  Open Source stuff ,  etc .  Its an interesting social experiment IMHO . 
-0.5	 @ Amytriptyline84 Its a totally accurate representation of what happened to my mind when I realised it is an n turn ! 
-0.5	 @ Amytriptyline84 Wha .  .  .  .  That is .  .  .  Mind  =  =  Blown 
-0.5	Does it annoy anyone else that the Apple winking emoji has the wrong eye winking ?   ;  )   =  =  right eye 😉  =  =  left eye .

-0.5	Playing GTA V ,  listening to  @ darren _ cullens band .  All good .  ♫
