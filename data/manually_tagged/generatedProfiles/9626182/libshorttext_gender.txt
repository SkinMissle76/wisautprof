-1	 @ ruby _ gem what ?  Why are you saying this ? 
-1	 @ firagabeatsrock innit . 
-1	 .  @ northernrailorg so the company that runs the train is not able to affect the condition of the train ?  Who signed this lease agreement ?  ? 
-1	 @ northernrailorg thats not an excuse ,  you are responsible for the quality of your own service .  If that service is bad you must address it . 
-1	 @ northernrailorg why not renovate them ?  This is the corroded old toilet on this train .  Your passengers are people !  
-1	 @ northernrailorg Why is the state of your trains are so much worse than other train companies ?  The Notts - Leeds trains are filthy .

-1	 @ FriendlyTester a teams responsibilities go beyond delivering good software ,  they must also ensure theyll be even more effective in future
