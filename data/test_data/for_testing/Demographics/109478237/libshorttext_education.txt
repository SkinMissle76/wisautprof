3	Right ,  stocked up on Zims ,  declaration now pls
3	Jesus ,  Seattle opening 20pt favs .  No - brainier on the Jags surely ? 
3	Could be good wicket for Eng ,  20 mins at em before lunch

3	Interesting .  Looking at the news ,  seems like for the first time this year Washington has actually played some defense .  .  .  . 
3	 # Benteke treated Genk like shit to move to us ,  Villa can hardly be surprised when he repeats his antics
3	Should the Eagles be concerned ?  Seems Oregon s offence wasnt wholly dependent on Chip Kelly
3	Lions lost the plot .  Surely the evens Australia wont last till Saturday
3	Bet the Bengals big today .  Like the Packers too ,  but today we see Good Andy Dalton and SD dont live with them . 
3	Western Kentucky  & amp ;  UL Ragin Cajuns two great offenses ,  only one can play defense .  Taking Hilltoppers  - 4
3	Its a practice match ffs ,  some utter and complete shite being talked about this England / Essex game just cos its on Sky

3	Miss Urine having problems with this wee boy  # educatingyorkshire
3	Manchester City a big price ,  no ?

3	Interesting ,  Jags  @  Broncos will be the highest handicap in NFL history

3	Market panic  :  ) 
3	James Hildreth .  Hard to think of anyone else so hyped and so consistently shit
3	So this weekend I was on both Western Kentucky and the NY Giants .  Had a lifetimes worth of turnovers against me in two games  # sigh  # FUMBLEl
3	Vegas completely middled on the first playoff game ;  will be chaos if Saints / Eagles hovers round the field goal at the end

3	I think  @ domvilla73 s quiet word with Lambert at Dortmund airport was the breakthrough in the  # Benteke deal .  .  .  . 
3	Could be a lay of the year job if England are faves to chase a middling total on here
3	Why are Sky so obsessed with Wembley NFL ,  by definition those watching arent going ,  so makes no difference to them where it is ? 
3	Couple of key numbers in tonights football .  Public money hopefully pushes us up to Arizona  + 7  & amp ;  North Carolina  + 10 .  Have to take the dogs
3	Misbah haters out in force again this morning I see  # misbahsfault
3	Sky Sports 2 now  -  Usman Afzaal smashing Warne round the Oval  # forgottenoddities

3	Market very keen on Pak here ,  many a slip possible between here and a lead though

3	 " Trotts shit wheres KP never heard of Stokes is 200 a big score then "   # killmenow
3	Market desperate to plummet one way or the other
3	More luck than judgement the IPL love today IMO ,  Lankans left a few out there  & amp ;  not much depth to Sunrisers
3	Worst thing about England games ,  Skys big guns .  Gower ,  Sir Ian ,  suits ,  joyless commentary .  Bob Key  & amp ;  Butch with fags and beer ,  please

3	Naked eye looked a shocker
3	Local  @ waitrose store putting up Christmas decorations in store .  10th of October .

3	Cant sort out the NFL game tonight ,  cant get past how awful Rams were in Dallas  & amp ;  dont trust 49ers as road favorite
3	Also .   " Matchday One "  is the worst phrase since  " FL72 "  .  Whats wrong with  " Last Wednesday "  ? 
3	 @ nclarke1899 Clear out at trade deadline ?  Not many to market really ,  heard Rios to Cincinnati possible ,  maybe Danks  & amp ;  Peavy to contenders ? 
3	Live events on BT Sport today :  Barnet v Cambridge ,  Nigeria v Ethiopia .  Bet subscribers feel thats money well spent
3	A low total for DET @ CLE but fully justified .  Weeden  +  Browns D  +  hampered Johnson  +  rain  =  somebody wins this 13 - 10
3	Finally got round to reading Sports Illustrateds OSU expose .  Some shocking stuff in Stillwater ,  great reporting though
3	Every incentive for Louisville  & amp ;  Teddy to run it up tonight for the cameras but Rutgers  + 19 is back door cover territory  # pass
3	Will the  @ SkyCricket Sachin programme be one second of a raised finger followed by 59 minutes of funereal silence ?

3	No Baaaaaaallll ! 
3	 @ MrLix yeah absolutely agree
3	Is this teacher on educating Yorkshire really called Miss Urine ? 
3	 @ nclarke1899 weird team this year what Ive seen , they swing at EVERYTHING as well ,  think someone drew a walk in April maybe .  Poorly managed
3	So after a day in large part spent discussing Trent Richardson as a Colt ,  time to watch Wigan Athletic play in Europe .  Odd day
3	Brian Hoyer done for the year .  # GodhatesCleveland
3	Well played Elton

3	Pregame suggesting public strongly betting Pittsburgh tonight .  I like the Reds  # MLBPostseason
3	Enjoyably farcical scenes in Philly ,  they need an orange ball
3	Browns have two high - pick offers for Josh Gordon .  Hard to see why theyre refusing ,  Jason Campbell wont get it within 10 yards of him
3	Quite fancy Guyana for the Windies T20 at the prices
3	Anyone got a next Villa manager market up ? 
3	Ah ,  the match losing run - a - ball 40 from Ravi coming up ? 
3	The Granderson deal is terrific business for the Mets at a position of need
3	England properly going round the park on SS2
3	Perth more suited by a wicket like this IMO ,  struggles have been when pushing on flat wickets
3	This is one of those where all your normal mates on Facebook are on Spain and all your industry mates on Twitter are on Tahiti
3	Oregon / Washington line dropping off the 14 .  Can see the upgrade in opposition theory but Ducks still win this by 20 + 
3	Khurram Manzoor :   " Credit my wife as well .  She wasnt here "  lol
3	Case Keenum starts for Houston in Kansas City .  Line - wise ,  what ,  2pts extra than Yates ? 
3	 @ Athletics Garlic fries in AT & amp ; T Park  ;  ) 
3	 @ markyiverson Biggest line ever in Super Bowl era .  Only one to beat it was Baltimore v expansion Falcons 1966 ,  31 . 5
