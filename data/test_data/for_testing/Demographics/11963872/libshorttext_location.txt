17	 @ charley _ roach Did  @ antbaenas Nicky Minaj mask arrive yet ? 
17	 @ antbaena 
17	 @ RichHarkness a Pi would take years to mine even a single coin .  The processing power needed is massive ,  but deliberately so . 
17	 @ imyke  @ mattalexand  @ viticci mykestories [ dot ] net
17	Awesome job ,    @ kylelambert !   & gt ;  This Incredible Portrait of Morgan Freeman Was Painted on an iPad 
17	 @ RichHarkness try explaining how the stock market works to normal folk ! 
17	 @ antbaena Into Darkness was a proverbial shit floating in the bowler hat of remakes . 
17	 @ RichHarkness in an apple store ?  specialist tends to be most popular .  genius isnt as glamorous as its made out to be
17	 @ heidivodka lost it at this 
17	Santas grotto at The Grove 
17	But on the plus side ,  my iPhone 5 was replaced .  Apparently the battery was also faulty in addition to the camera . 
17	 @ ismh 
17	And the world survives another solar orbit .  Kudos . 
17	 @ sheepfred very true ! 
17	 @ thedoyle Thats one of my favourites ! 
17	Seriously ,  funniest movie ever . 
17	 @ heidivodka 
17	iPhone camera has this weird mark ,  lens is clean and scratch free .  Seems a Genius Bar visit is needed 
17	 @ marcoarment Welch doesnt have a shit list ,  its just a single text file containing a wildcard character . 
17	 @ thedoyle  @ iKylez hunted * 
17	Back in Blighty
17	 @ mrjosereyes 
17	 @ iKylez awesome .  Wonder if  @ thedoyle will be in the country .  .  . 
17	 @ imyke it was the same for Forza 3 on 360 which was two discs .  Disc 2 had to be installed to the hard drive before you could play it . 
17	Its a Christmas miracle !  RT  @ justinbieber :  My beloved beliebers Im officially retiring
17	 @ fneb agreed ,  but it’s a step in the right direction and the pardon is more symbolic of the acceptance of the “crime” being absurd . 
17	 @ imyke the beauty of podcasts is that geography is never an issue . 
17	 @ staroversky I was in an Apple Store and they were literally putting them on the shelves . 
17	 @ caseyliss  @ marcoarment  @ siracusa   @ hotdogsladies I think I just crossed the streams 
17	Anyone making those claims will receive a swift kick to the shins and paper cuts between their toes . 
17	 @ johnny _ winter  @ Penderworth woah ,  woah .  I wont hear a bad word uttered about the Creme Egg .  Anyone who doesnt enjoy them is a communist
17	 @ fneb  @ MarsCuriosity i remember watching it last year !  uncharted Worlds ,  wasnt it ? 
17	 @ tumtumtum Thanks ,  glad it isnt just me then ! 
17	 @ AmazonHelp and now Amazon have admitted part of my order was given to the wrong courier and has no idea where it is .  What a shambles
17	Ive ordered the parts and have even grabbed a few bargains in the Steam sale . 
17	 @ heidivodka Riker is making me question certain lifestyle choices 
17	Quite impressed with the Jawbone UP24 I picked up in LA . 
17	 @ fneb It seems to be officially supported ,  they have a kbase on it too 
17	 @ imyke  " Give me your number ,  your boots and your motorcycle " 
17	 @ ismh A few actually got made ,  heres one booting up 
17	So it seems Twitterrific’s notifications will push mentions from blocked users .  Switching back to Tweetbot as that’s not acceptable . 
17	 @ macdrifter thought as much ,  just looked into it and iCloud can restore all passwords but only to same device ,  not a new one . 
17	That was a damn good Reuben
17	 @ RichHarkness Ive used it previously between iOS ,  Mac and Android .  Has always worked flawlessly .  The apps are great . 
17	 @ apkawel  @ drdrang  @ macdrifter  @ techdiffpodcast ironically ,  I unfollowed  @ iAWriter for their tasteless and illogical use of the patent system
17	 @ Zite  @ johnny _ winter this is actually getting  * worse *  .  Almost ready to ditch the app completely . 
17	 @ fneb I assume  " poor health "  isnt a good enough reason for doctors appointments with them ? 
17	 @ johnny _ winter  @ Zite Same here .  Getting a  * lot *  of articles about subjects Ive got no interest in that are of a questionable content
17	 @ fneb if I had a bigger budget ,  Id go Intel .  Though AMD will be more than enough for my needs now and in the future
17	 @ mattalexand 20 ICICLES YOU WONT BELIEVE ARE JUST FROZEN WATER  - BuzzFeed
17	 @ iKylez I can see !  If youre not working at Pixar or ILM by next week then something has gone wrong in the world . 
17	 @ fneb AMD works best for my budget and the performance between 1 / 2 sticks of RAM is about 2 - 3 %  ,  but lets me upgrade easier down the road
17	 @ RichHarkness yep .  Can’t be bothered with a next - gen console ,  plus the game prices are just too much
17	 @ Glinner A fair and coherent response to a poorly written and anonymous forum post that has the internet up in arms ?  How dare you ! 
17	 @ neilcochrane1 haha !  I have no such excuse .  .  .  But Ill still watch it guilt - free ! 
17	Multiple vaults in  @ 1Password is just brilliant
17	Best ever purchase at a pound shop 
17	 @ johnny _ winter Have had a few other people say the same thing .  How long ago ?  I thought the stores were able to replace the camera part now
17	 @ fneb no ,  the music !   : p
17	 @ fneb ah gotcha !  Will try SteamMover
17	 @ thedoyle Remember :  Every take off is optional but every landing is mandatory .

17	 @ iKylez Ill be in Manchester over Christmas and assume  @ thedoyle will be too .  .  . 
17	 @ AmazonHelp bit annoyed a Prime order I placed that stated one - day delivery is now going to be 4 days . 
17	 @ beckettl33 John Newman  =   
17	 @ johnny _ winter I got a carrier settings update though my iPhone has never been on a 4G capable network before ,  only ever offered a 3G toggle
17	 @ macdrifter  @ collis yep ,  really sad to see it go . 
17	 @ RichHarkness or its alternate title  " Percy Jackson and the Harry Potter lawsuit "  . 
17	 @ Penderworth  @ tutsplus excellent !  I’ve recently started using Lightroom so will be reading this through
17	 @ squeeby 
17	 @ fneb finally started a gaming rig build ! 
17	Great work Amazon .  Part of my order was “misrouted” and was given to the wrong courier ,  and they don’t know which . 
17	PC Assemble !  
17	 @ johnny _ winter sounds like itd be a whole unit swap then !  Thats actually preferable as mine is a little on the scratched side  :  ) 
17	 @ imyke you  # meta
17	People of the UK :  Stop what youre doing and put Film4 on . Its Airplane !   # dontcallmeshirley
17	 @ caseyliss Pepsi Max  & gt ;  Diet Coke . Anyone who says otherwise is a communist
17	Back from Dusseldorf
17	As someone who has the pleasure of knowing  @ kylelambert and seeing him work first hand ,  its disheartening to hear people claim hes a fraud
17	 @ fneb Ta !  Been playing a lot of FTL recently .  Hoping No Mans Sky gets a release but after the studios flood ,  not sure itll be this year
17	 @ siracusa Sweet zombie Jesus ,  this has fixed my  " Why do all my PS3 games overlap the screen ?  "  problem . 
17	Joey ,  have you ever been in a Turkish prison ?   # airplane
17	 @ johnny _ winter  @ TheMacFixer  @ leighswifty I’ve bought so many USB 3 . 0 hubs that don’t quite work with a Mac properly that I’ve just given up
17	 @ squeeby CTRL - UNSEE
17	Its heard to believe that some of those involved with Airplane !  are responsible for the majority of the Scary Movie franchise
17	Cacti 
17	Three just activated 4G on my iPhone .  
17	Yet another reason not to read The Verge 
17	 .  @ siracusa VGX summed up in a GIF 
17	 @ staroversky IFTTT and Myfitnesspal mostly .  Fitbit seems overly complex and I just want something thats easy to operate . 
17	 @ johnny _ winter My business account with Cater Allen uses BACS only ,  no FPS either .  Have to wait a few days when transferring
17	 @ staroversky the sleep tracking and app integration to third party services sold it to me . 
17	 @ RichHarkness no skill is needed ,  just vast processing power .  Dedicated bitcoin mining machines cost upwards of ten grand
17	Writer Pro Developers Double Down on Innovations in Being Douchebags :  
17	 @ staroversky I was considering the Fuelband SE but as I use the Nike running app ,  the Jawbone offered more features and integration . 
17	FARSCAPE IS ON NETFLIX !

17	 @ thedoyle somehow the noise is terrifying . 
17	OMG APPLE WILL HAVE TO ADOPT USB IN EU !  !  ! No .  If you think that ,  you’re a moron . 
17	Apple Geniuses :  If my iPhone 5 camera is faulty ,  is that a whole unit swap or is the camera component replaced ? 
17	Git Commit 
17	 @ caseyliss  @ erinliss 
17	 @ RichHarkness I’m 30 and am in the same mindset on my way to work .  LAST DAY WOO

17	Hollywoodland 
17	 @ johnny _ winter  @ Zite exact same article here as well
17	 @ RichHarkness Wunderlist is x - platform and works great .  Even share lists with other users . 
17	 @ iKylez same again unfortunately  :  (  wish I was still working from home !  !  ! 
17	 @ johnny _ winter BACS is three working days ,  unfortunately .  Most banks should support immediate using Faster Payments  /  FPS
17	Its almost time for Brian Butterfields Christmas Pizza 
17	I was under the impression restoring from an iCloud backup would also restore account passwords ?  Had to enter most of them again…
17	 @ RichHarkness I think Nexus 5 displays it regardless of network .  Keep it on though ,  Id say
17	 @ RichHarkness if it helps ,  its a work trip and Ive seen sod all of LA ! 
17	Benrath Castle 
17	Most of the components have arrived ,  with the GPU and case arriving Mon / Tue .  I might actually have a gaming rig built this side of 2013
17	Thanks to the Mac App Store ,   @ dropbox and  @ 1password I have the majority of my apps and data for my new Mac set up in less than an hour
17	About time !   " UK government scraps the paper car tax disc after more than 90 years "  
17	 @ johnny _ winter in which case ,  that is pretty poor service .  Ive done transfers on a Saturday night that worked instantly
17	 @ iKylez dude ,  you were in London ?  !  ? 
17	 " If you move your mouse pointer while the data is being returned to Microsoft Excel ,  the query may not fail "

17	 @ fneb this link should work 
17	 @ fneb I just got a new rMBP so the Mac mini is going .  That game looks great ,  even has controller support !

17	 @ imyke  @ johnvoorhees  @ mattalexand  @ ismh  @ ismh Roger Moore returns in WAITING FOR REVIEW . 
17	 @ squeeby 
17	I really want to like Remember Me ,  but it just isnt that great a game . 
17	 @ mattalexand Speaking of garbage at CES ,  someone ,  somewhere ,  is upset because they cant use Google Glass and their 3D TV at the same time . 
17	This is a glorious anecdote on laziness 
17	Joey ,  you ever hang around the gymnasium ?   # airplane
17	The poll of 1 , 000 US visitors to Scotland found 33 %  thought haggis was an animal .  .  .  
17	And the award for best cliffhanger goes to…
17	 @ Twitterrific Im continually getting notifications of mentions from users Ive blocked ,  but they dont appear in the timeline . 
17	Be nice to those working in retail today .  They’re as stressed as you are ,  but it isn’t their fault you left your shopping to the last minute
17	The allure of abandoned Tube stations 
17	 @ squeeby Is that your home number ?  !  ? 
17	The ‘Home Alone’ Plot Point You Might Have Missed 
17	 @ fneb Sounds like a good idea to have .  My current Steam Library is only 60GB for now and Ive got a  * lot *  to get through
17	 @ viticci is this really Nintendos digital policy ?  
17	 @ danielmartyn if you can make a tiled version ,  Ill make you feel good
17	 @ OliverMCarding 
17	 @ RichHarkness Good God ,  it was glorious .  I still maintain 3D is superfluous ,  but it has to be watched in IMAX to truly experience it . 
17	 @ Penderworth efficient and to the point .  I kid ,  loved it . 
17	 @ RichHarkness I’ve been researching it more recently ,  too .  Very interesting stuff !  I know someone who has a dedicated mining rig for bitcoin
17	 @ macdrifter wish I’d done an iTunes backup first now .  iCloud backup never restores quite right
17	 @ staroversky its actually pretty great .  Lack of display isnt a problem ,  always have my iPhone on me ,  and the app works really well . 
17	Skyrim mod turns dragons into Thomas the Tank Engine 
17	 @ Twitterrific is there a workaround at all ?  Im having to turn off notifications which isnt ideal
17	 @ antbaena any Lostprophets ?
