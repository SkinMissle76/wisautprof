-0.58	 @ SuperStanners BTW ,  dreamt that you were loudly slagging me off in the pub because of my taste in magazines . 
-0.58	 @ bernardtyers  @ AlecMuffett Depends what they wanted it for ,  what I got in return ,  their data policy ,  and how much I relied on the app .

-0.58	 @ philstuart Yeah .  Really liked it a lot ,  but dont think it was a classic . 
-0.58	 @ paddycarey Right ,  and if you ever wanted to change to another system much easier to replace XBMC than your TV . 
-0.58	I want to look at some big data .  Who works on a high - traffic site and wants to give me access to their Google Analytics ? 
-0.58	That’s one barrier to Google Glass adoption removed .  
-0.58	 @ jonronson Not fair to blame it on Twitter ;  it was people ,  facilitated by Twitter .  Same as the Arab Spring .

-0.58	I’d rather keep TV as a dumb receptacle and do the smart business on mobile devices that are easier to change and upgrade .

-0.58	Looks like this new update to Facebook for Android means its time to uninstall the app .  
-0.58	 @ perezdavid I prefer to use my phone or tablet to control my TV ,  and not have the apps on the TV itself .  Why do I need  * another *  platform ? 
-0.58	Why I want Bitcoin to die in a fire :

-0.58	Interesting infographic showing HTC’s Android update process :  
-0.58	I suspect that if I ever bought a smartwatch ,  I would only ever use the clock app . 
-0.58	Think this has gone round before ,  but bears repeating ;  media - influenced opinion vs reality of modern Britain .  
-0.58	Could everyone please stop saying the Factory Floor album was one of the best of 2013 .  It wasn’t .  It’s awful . 
-0.58	How about a mass New Year’s resolution :  to exercise restraint before we spread stories that haven’t been confirmed ?  
-0.58	An update to my earlier tweet about uninstalling the Facebook app :  Privacy ,  permission ,  and opting out 
-0.58	 @ alastc Probably .  Looks like it was never properly tested on a tablet or laptop . 
-0.58	 .  @ BTCare is it true that you will block potentially life - saving sex education websites ?  
-0.58	Solid proof at CES that electronics companies don’t care about users  -  e . g .  the world’s most complicated TV remote .  
-0.58	Or how about the dual - boot Android / Windows 8 tablet / laptop :  
-0.58	Aw ,  you said  " sleeps "  instead of  " nights "  !  We all find you incredibly sweet and charming now ! 
-0.58	 @ dstorey  @ thebabydino Sounds like you need to watch the last 20 minutes of Scrooged again . 
-0.58	Merry Christmas .  
-0.58	Id thought that 2013 wasnt a vintage year for documentaries ,  but The Act of Killing changed my mind completely .  
-0.58	 @ brucel Thought you’d like it .  Staggering work .  Good interview with the director here :  
-0.58	 @ djmc  @ DeanPerry The example given is SMS authorisation ,  which is fine .  But it’s an example ;  once permission’s given ,  they can do anything . 
-0.58	In the past everyone celebrated New Year’s Eve but now they JUST LOOK AT THEIR PHONES .  
-0.58	Was going to start asking questions about Harry Potter but worried that people will answer them as if they are actually important . 
-0.58	False dichotomy or either - or dilemma :  who will be king in 2014 ?  
-0.58	The only news from CES which is genuinely laudable is that all of Intel’s new processors are conflict mineral free .  
-0.58	Without Alicia at the helm ,  I expect Blackberry will begin a slide into obsolescence . 
-0.58	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers I don’t know .  But taking this to the European courts seems like a more time - intensive approach than uninstalling . 
-0.58	Reliably informed by  @ richquick and  @ mkjones that  " We Are Never Ever… "  was released in 2012 .  Still the best song of 2013 . 
-0.58	Very long ,  quite nerdy ,  but interesting piece on OS / 2 ,  and modern parallels with Microsoft and Blackberry :  
-0.58	 @ luke161 Because as far as I can tell there are no actual jokes in it ,  just exaggerated pastiche . 
-0.58	The vine - swinging with monkeys scene in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull is one of the lowest points of modern cinema history . 
-0.58	The bugs I ate at  # dinosnores .   @  Natural History Museum 
-0.58	This graffiti appears more admiring than insulting .  
-0.58	Knowledge sharing is so common in the web industry that we forget how rare and newsworthy it is in some others .

-0.58	Hope to see fewer zombies and more pirates in games in 2014 . 
-0.58	 @ RobHicks666 Kids should grow up too . 
-0.58	How Britain exported next - gen surveillance :  
-0.58	Taylor Swifts  " We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together "  was the best song of 2013 .  Im still immune to judgement . 
-0.58	It’s unsurprising that a thing built purely for connection to the internet isn’t useful when the internet is unavailable . 
-0.58	 @ arseblog That’d be brilliant ,  thanks .  I might blog some stuff about it ,  but won’t make any numbers public without permission . 
-0.58	Charles Darwin getting into the Christmas spirit .   # dinosnores

-0.58	My first New Years resolution is to beat Level 32 of “Juicy Jacuzzi” in Candy Crush Saga .

-0.58	What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur with Tom Cruise and David Beckham ?  Tyranno - short - arse Becks .   # dinosnores
-0.58	 @ paddycarey Considering 80 %  of what I do is through the browser ,  I have the same potential drawback on my Macbook ,  Ubuntu box ,  etc . 
-0.58	 @ matthewhughes  @ verge It was mostly a rhetorical question .  The answer is depressingly simple . 
-0.58	 @ webinista My fear is that it’s not Firefox OS that needs improving ,  but the web on mobile . 
-0.58	This is my kind of table setting .   # dinosnores 
-0.58	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers Those permissions are not optional .  I don’t agree to grant them .  My choice therefore is to uninstall the app . 
-0.58	 @ TheIndyPeople  @ Independent That article is completely wrong .  Read his  * actual *  apology .  
-0.58	Speaking of which ,  why do you still like Christmas ?  Nobody likes Christmas anymore . 
-0.58	A little late ,  but just saw the documentary Blackfish ,  on the killer orca at SeaWorld .  Another outstanding  @ bbcstoryville film .  Recommended . 
-0.58	Pretty bold of Samsung to position the Gear for the creepy stalker market .  
-0.58	 @ brucel Thats old .  My shit is all original .  My jokes ,  too . 
-0.58	 @ luke161 It’s knowing crap instead of accidental crap .  Fun for a two minute promo ,  but can you imagine actually watching 90 minutes of it ? 
-0.58	If you’re at all interested in football ,  there’s a must - read article in  @ WiredUK on how data shapes modern tactics :

-0.58	Firefox OS for TV ?  Wow .  I’m not even convinced it’s ready for mobile yet ,  let alone the murky waters of TV .  
-0.58	 @ SuperStanners But without the debonair charm of Gareth Hunt . 
-0.58	Being obliged to watch some Harry Potter .  Really ?  THIS is what all the fuss is about ? 
-0.58	 @ richquick Old .  Im making new stuff  ( hence the quality )  . 
-0.58	Two companies still owe me money from last year .  Reminders sent ,  public shaming to follow . 
-0.58	 @ patrick _ h _ lauke Go easy on me . 
-0.58	 @ AlecMuffett  @ bernardtyers Not really .  If I give permission to use SMS in this way and FB later decide to use it in another way ,  they can . 
-0.58	Florence Welch’s vocal on Sweet Nothing was probably the best of 2013 . 
-0.58	 @ vasilis Hate to break it to you ,  those emails are fake . 
-0.58	This morning I started singing “All the dingleberries” to Beyoncé’s ‘Single Ladies’ ,  and now I can’t stop . 
-0.58	 @ brucel The only one I stopped watching was This Is The End .  Self - indulgent ,  too much improvisation . 
-0.58	Amazing takedown of Love Actually :  
-0.58	Ive said it before ,  but my personal data gets shared on my terms .  Its an exchange ,  a  negotiation ,  not a tax for installing an app . 
-0.58	Two sets of navigation ,  two adverts ,  a promoted area ,  and an illustration .  But no useful content ,  not even a title . 
-0.58	It looks like  @ recode have designed for huge high - res screens ;  on my Macbook I see no content on the page at all .  
-0.58	 @ fabiovenni  @ arseblog I’ll be putting some analysis online ,  sure . 
-0.58	 @ prehensile Not my screenshot ,  so don’t know the full URL . 
-0.58	Blackberry should hurry to fill her role with someone more suitable .  I expect Christina Aguilera is available . 
-0.58	 @ MaxTB It’s not kneejerk ;  I don’t want to give open access to my SMS to FB .  I choose to uninstall the app and use the website instead . 
-0.58	 @ Glinner People Who Eat Darkness came to paperback in 2013 ,  not sure if that counts…
