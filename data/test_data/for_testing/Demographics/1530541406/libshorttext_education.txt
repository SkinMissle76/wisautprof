2	There is nothing quite like coming home from a long stay away and the jolly old English weather reminding you what real autumn feels like

2	 @ katybluewater seems a bit of a way from Redhill ,  there must be something in the town ? 
2	Popping to Redhill for a coffee with a chum in about an hour ,  wheres a jolly place to go ? 
2	How lovely ,  flies buzzing around bins in Redhill .  Be gone you parasitical winged vermin .  I banish you from Surrey forever ! 
2	Well I must say that summer was jolly nice ,  popping the boating stripes back into storage for next year .  Wheres my Parka and wellies ? 
2	 @ deanneblaylock  @ chrismads not sure this is entirely above board ,  but here you go !   # selfie

2	I do so love an early start to the weekend .  Motoring back towards Reigate and heading straight to the pub for Pimms and a pint  # summer
2	Alastair Cook ,  13 is not an acceptable score !  Strong rendition of the national anthem though ,  good lad ! 
2	Cant watch this lot anymore ,  switching over to the  # Ashes
2	Just saw Ed Balls face .  Nearly choked on my coffee  # PMQs
2	Sat watching  # PMQs with a cup of coffee .  Its like the head boy and captain of the rugger team squabbling in the common room
2	So ,  what have I missed ?   # Surrey
2	 # Reigate looks outstanding in the sun ;  welcome home me
2	And back in  # Surrey after a two week sojourn to the Lake District .   A little bit of walking and a lot of sitting in pubs  # delightful
2	My head hurts .   I feel like a horse is galloping in my skull .   This situation requires tea ,  toast and marmalade
2	IT is not dignified to be drunk in public ,  so heading back to mine with G and Al to continue the party  # nightcap
2	LIVING LA VIDA LOCAAA

2	Sun is shining ,  weather is sweet .  .  . gosh ,  those would be outstanding song lyrics
2	After a long day there is little better than lounging in the garden with a glass of red wine . 
2	The lure of a pub garden is calling me through the evenings warmth ,  but first must don a suit for a business meeting
2	Been north of Banstead all day  -  or out of town as I call it  -  heading back to the safety of Reigate now  # LightHeaded
