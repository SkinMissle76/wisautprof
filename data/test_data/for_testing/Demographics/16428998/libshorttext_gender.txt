-1	Ive think Ive been pretty versatile  changing my sound on violin these last few weeks . 
-1	The stars look awesome tonight !  !  ! 
-1	Going to have lunch at Chuys with some friends !  !  !

-1	So I completely failed at exiting a room and headbutted the corner of a really heavy door leaving a large red swollen bump on my forehead
