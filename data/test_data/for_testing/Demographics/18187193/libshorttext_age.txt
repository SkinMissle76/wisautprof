-0.58	 @ BGJasonP Congratulations buddy ! 
-0.58	Brilliant play from Drogba .  Hes still incredible
-0.58	Not vintage from Real tonight ,  but great dummy from Benzema for Ronaldo to tap home .  Quiet night for Ronnie ,  but surely Ballon dOr winner ? 
-0.58	 @ LTPeterson92  @ BrownBearSahil missed out there .  I think Herrera would have been for you ,  but need a physical presence and creator in one
-0.58	 @ Sport _ AdRev Good man !  Works good ,  just a distinct lack of Football and FM chat ! 
-0.58	 "  .  .  . as Arsenals season plunged into chaos .  "   -  The Sun .  What a load of tosh that sentence is .

-0.58	Usually quite rate Howard Webb but should have been a pen for Liverpool then
-0.58	 @ LeighMonty12  @ LTPeterson92 Id genuinely take a punt on Berbatov if we are after a ST
-0.58	Jonjo Shelvey is a barrel of laughs isnt he
-0.58	 @ MessiMinutes if you want to be the best ,  you have to beat the best .  Were capable . 
-0.58	It speaks to youth in a language they understand .  Sport can create hope where once there was only despair .  .  . 
-0.58	 @ LTPeterson92 thought he had taken a touch too many but managed to squeeze the ball through .  Loved it .  Hate Dawson
-0.58	 @ LeighMonty12 I reckon my signed photo of him will be worth a small fortune after that  ;  ) 
-0.58	 @ garns007 decent draw then bud ! 
-0.58	 @ Hesfivefootfour  @ LittleDutchVA not saying the Ox will score those goals ,  but is a real handful and more confident running with ball
-0.58	 @ BrownBearSahil I wouldnt fancy Gala .  Away leg will be so tough . 
-0.58	Superb work from Bale ,  is he fully fit though ?  Left thigh taped up and obvs missed PSG friendly .

-0.58	RIP Nelson Mandela
-0.58	 @ garns007 thought that would be the case ,  probably same for me .  Was a good game last season in the League Cup ! 
-0.58	 @ ConnorHarte44  @ BrownBearSahil in our 49 game unbeaten run Pires scored 19 goals .  .  .  He was class . 
-0.58	 @ BrownBearSahil need a consistent base too ,  constantly changing CBs and CMs  ( I know cant be helped )  but regularity will help
-0.58	 @ annalouiseadams For what its worth I think you should go to the Uni that you enjoyed most .  Could you not loan your ST out ? 
-0.58	Millions of Euros worth of talent subbed on and off for Real and their home - grown Jesé sets Benzema up .   # realmadrid
-0.58	 @ davidjaca A la Rami .  Shame theyve farmed him out on loan from Jan ,  esp if Dukic isnt even in charge then ! 
-0.58	 @ MirrorFootball Nothing like Wenger ,  the coat isnt long enough !

-0.58	 @ garns007 should be a good game .  You going to try and go ? 
-0.58	 @ arsenalvision Surely Wenger wouldnt allow that ? 
-0.58	Lazio vs Inter and Real Madrid vs Celta Vigo tonight .  Sorted ! 
-0.58	
-0.58	 @ BrownBearSahil why would you do that ?  Haha . 
-0.58	 @ LTPeterson92  @ BrownBearSahil thats what I mean ,  Coentrao good at both aspects .  Could definitely solve your long term LB problem

-0.58	Bit late ,  but Happy New Year everyone ! 
-0.58	 @ SianyMacalarny Brilliant stuff ,  Sian .  Completely agree RE Vermaelen too .  For years we have wished for 3 / 4 quality CBs and now we have 3 ! 
-0.58	Awesome defending from Castan ,  this match is brilliant !  Rossi should have taken it on his right side ,  wanted too much time
-0.58	 @ LeighMonty12 Well ,  now Ive put £5 on Zola to WBA ,  he probably will take over the Spuds .  .  . 
-0.58	 @ Sport _ AdRev 
-0.58	 @ BrownBearSahil two obvious names massive losses .  An in form Nani could be massive boost
-0.58	 @ G92Jones would be good mate but I play on a Saturday !  Would be different if it was to report ,  though !
