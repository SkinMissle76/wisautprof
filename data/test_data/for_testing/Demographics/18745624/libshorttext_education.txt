2	 @ dianacnearhos All this weather mess makes me extremely happy I have a home playoff game today
2	 @ dianacnearhos Trust me ,  United is far worse
2	 # Bengals confident theyre ready to win in playoffs and end a 22 - season drought 
2	 @ kemper34 He wasnt
2	So is Shayne Graham trending in both Cincinnati and New Orleans at the moment ? 
2	 @ CEvearitt Luck bounced back from his and has done something that Dalton hasnt  -  -  win a playoff game
2	RT  @ dcmayes  @ joereedy what are the chances Bengalis will play Denver next round if they win ?  & gt ; Divisional ?  Zero . 
2	 @ HoosierLyss  @ burnSTYLEr I wonder if that will be discussed on Pats show
2	 @ mikeschanne  @ BlockedByLance  @ MoEgger1530 And why would I block Mo ? 
2	 @ WaffleHouse16 Agreed and if they do they should
2	 @ WaffleHouse16 If you were smart and read his timeline ,  you will see why I said that .  Win or loss I still have a job to do .  No effect
2	 @ Sammyboy2715 Cant send a tweet like that in the second quarter though

2	Things a little chippy in Champaign
2	 @ DarrylSlater Third longest active postseason win drought in the league .  You get to see No .  1 tomorrow . 
2	 @ Foster777 that would be Marv
2	For a dramatic representation of how ML press conferences sometimes go 
2	 @ kevingildea Because Marvin always answers questions directly and he never checks me into the boards 3 times a press conference
2	RT  @ jnicklawson :   @ joereedy i remember predicting 0 - 16 3 years ago & gt ; I had 5 - 11 and was being generous
2	 @ kevingildea  @ barnesjb29 Well Kevin you did say I am a  # terriblebeatreporter and  " should get canned " 
2	 @ ReneeMcDowell I know but since Im one of your few Ohio followers I felt like I had to do a rebuttal there
2	RT  @ KyleLawless12 :   @ joereedy chances both TE play tomorrow ?  & gt ; Decent
2	RT  @ nrajag :   @ joereedy what are the odds Newman is active tomorrow ?  & gt ; Slim
2	 @ ReneeMcDowell Umm  .  .  .  
2	RT  @ kevingildea :   @ joereedy are rosters expanded for playoffs ?  Meaning can they activate more then 45 ?  & gt ; No and it has been 46 since 2011
2	3 years ago today was the most contentious and uncomfortable press conference in Bengals history .  Since then :  30 - 20 and 3 playoff trips
2	 @ BPhillips4GG Unfollow button is on the right Adam
2	 @ EffAyBeOh True ,  but if Howard had remained healthy imagine Maualuga back at SAM ,  Tez in Middle and Howard at WIL . 
2	 @ EffAyBeOh Thomas Howard was playing the same spot before he got injured and led the team in tackles . 
2	Can we cue up the Flipper theme for Boyd ? 
2	 @ TimSullivan714 Im all in favor of that if its Matt Millen

2	 @ timothyrh League rules
2	 @ jwheel011  @ Zslowmotion We’ll see
2	 @ iShayWatiWant Chad didn’t buy one single ticket .  It was a stunt
2	RT  @ FartinVanBuren :   @ joereedy Newman listed doubtful .  .  too caught up in the sell out drama to tweet this one ?  & gt ; Did that over an hour ago
2	RT  @ Zslowmotion :   @ joereedy yes or no ?  If you were a betting man ,  is Newman active for Sunday ?  & gt ; No
2	RT  @ Nmbr1WhoDeyFan :   @ joereedy is most disappointed person about sellout .  Now he has nothing to tweet about .  & gt ; really ?  
2	 # Bengals announce P & amp ; G bought the remaining tickets
2	Now I can go back to working Rhime of the Ancient Mariner into my Sunday advance
2	Thank God !   # Bengals announce the game is sold out .  Let freedom ring
2	Newman did practice today for the first time since the injury on Dec .  8 but is still doubtful .  He was limited .   # Bengals
2	 # Bengals Probable :  Collins ,  Crocker ,  Green ,  Kirkpatrick ,  Vinny Rey ,  A . Smith ,  Whitworth
2	 # Bengals injuries Doubt :  Newman ;   ? able :  Cook ,  Eifert ,  Gilberry ,  Gresham  .  .  . 
2	Since there is a  @ BlockedByLance account ,  I cant wait to see if there is a BlockedByReedy or BlockedbyMikeSilver account
2	 @ chgolaw Did I ask you to end all tweets that way ?  I dont think I did
2	 @ chgolaw This just in ,  sometimes players dont work out at one spot and work at others . 
2	 @ tom _ dillingham No ,  I cant
2	 @ IMTTHBY  @ chgolaw Because said tweeter usually grips and moans about everything and also because I hadnt seen that Evan Mathis made it
2	 @ chgolaw Next time when theres more than one Mathis ,  be specific .  I dont know ,  ask Paul Alexander
2	 @ chgolaw Robert Mathis has always played for the Colts
2	 @ adamgould1 Interesting ,  did one better
2	Figured I would switch up the avatar in honor of today

2	If you majored or minored in Literature ,  Sundays  # Bengals -  # Chargers advance is for you .  Plenty of references to a Coleridge poem
2	 @ ScoundrelThomas Glad to hear it .  Bundle up
2	 @ gregmastin Chargers have played well in cold weather
2	 @ ScoundrelThomas Why cant fans step up and purchase tickets for a team that won a division title and finished 8 - 0 at home ? 
2	One of these days I might actually get to write about a game happening on Sunday  # ticketfatigue
2	 @ Deck2424 
2	 @ RobBoyles1418 Kroger didnt .  Large portion but still tickets remaining
2	Plus if Kroger bought all the tickets and there was a sellout ,  dont you think they would have said it ? 
2	And as noted previously ,  Kroger and  # Bengals had been talking for awhile about this
2	From digging around multiple sources ,  the number of locations and past Kroger tix buys ,  indications are Kroger bought more than 1 , 200
2	 @ OchoDirko No
2	More on Krogers purchase of  # Bengals tickets and where military members / veterans can get them on Sat .  
2	 @ gregmastin Duke did yesterday .  It was in todays story
2	 @ DukeGirl8 has to get to an acceptable number first plus in this case they have to pay full price and not 33 cents on the dollar
2	 @ 95RallyCat Did you see what I said five minutes ago ? 
2	 @ AndrewDasNYT 10 , 000 of the best and brightest ? 
2	A Kroger spokeswoman would not say how many tickets were bought
2	 # Bengals tickets will be donated to active service members and veterans at seven Kroger locations in Ohio and Kentucky
2	Kroger and  # Bengals have been working on a ticket buy for awhile plus Kroger has come through in the past
2	Kroger announces it has purchased  " a large quantity of tickets "  for the  # Bengals game
2	 @ MikeGarafolo Last I heard around 5 - 6K
2	Meijer to Kroger  -  -  We stepped up in Indy ,  what are you going to do in Cincy ? 
2	 @ bmychal14 Triplette
2	 @ MrSportsNews Both Indy and GB were in the 3 , 000 range last night which means close to TV station buy .  Cincy has not announced a number yet
2	 @ mpendland44 Thanks for following
2	 @ Fox19Kelly So you drew the short straw and had to do Stadium duty today ? 
2	 @ Mr _ BobMurdock 321 - SEAT buys ad time .  I think most fans know about secondary market
2	Looking at the  @ JimIrsay Twitter feed ,  it sounds like Indy has a sellout
2	 @ mpendland44 Sorry ,  Im in ticket sales question fatigue mode
2	 @ DukeGirl8 Yup .  Welcome to Cincinnati
2	 @ mpendland44 When there is something to announce ,  it will be announced
2	 @ Mr _ BobMurdock Yes ,  it counts but only once  -  -  when it was bought at the team ticket office or Ticketmaster
2	 @ Mr _ BobMurdock Why wouldnt they count ?  They were originally bought by someone
2	 @ jsmytho What do you call him lowering ticket prices in the regular season the past two years ?  Thats not helping the fan base ? 
2	 # Bengals headed to the bubble at UC to practice today
2	 @ jsmytho No it wouldnt because he has done that before for regular - season games .  Hasnt bought all but a significant portion . 
2	 @ johnwilhelm17 Since 2005 .  I get the MB rage ,  just misplaced when it comes to this week
2	 @ gabeworld33 The league has blacked out playoff games before
2	 @ gabeworld33 They’ll announce how many left in the morning . 
2	 @ gabeworld33 No .  Have to opt into it in July .  Plus since the league takes all ticket revenue for postseason ,  not sure it would apply
2	 @ gabeworld33 Yes you are .  Teams can choose whether to opt into the 85 percent rule or not .  Only two teams  ( TB and Miami )  did . 
2	The Nick Saban postgame presser could be just precious tonight
2	 @ FSOhioZJackson Story Time with Uncle Zac ?

2	RT  @ FSOhioZJackson :  2014 :  Youngstown University of Mooney 2 ,  SEC 0 & gt ; Youngstown ,  Ohio ,  bro
2	The last time I saw Katherine Webb in the Superdome — Super Bowl Media Day — she was much happier . 
2	The league ,  not MB ,  gets the ticket revenue .  For the  " I’m not giving MB my money "  segment this is your dream week to go to a game
2	It’s amazing how the people sending me the anti Mike Brown emails tis week are missing one important point with the playoff game  .  .  . 
2	Hell of a pitch and catch there
2	 @ davebiddle  @ BretHoovler If I can’t remember why I blocked you ,  I usually do parole .  I do have certain people blocked who are in for life
2	 @ davebiddle  @ BretHoovler Done
2	 @ HubbuchNYP He’s ripping the kicker’s heart out with his own hands

2	RT  @ JasonAnderson55 :   @ joereedy  @ pdxhero its called multitasking ,  I recommend you try it sometime & gt ; This is called blocking which I recommend
2	 # Bengals are saying that Fifth Third ,  Cincinnati Insurance Co .  ,  Cintas ,  UDF ,  Liberty Mutual / Safeco ,  WCPO and Jeff Ruby have bought tickets
2	 # bengals are saying the 3 , 500 tickets available number per their official twitter account is not valid

2	 @ jamo3 _ 6 _ 0  @ CodyJohnson08 He didnt do it the first time .  Motorola did
2	 @ TyrusHumphrey I mentioned him and Minnesota on Tuesday ,  where have you been ?
