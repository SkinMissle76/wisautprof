40	Todays pregame theme song  ( and no it isnt Katy Perry )  :  
40	By the way ,  thanks to all the new followers this week and all who stuck around despite  # ticketfatigue
40	 @ dianacnearhos All this weather mess makes me extremely happy I have a home playoff game today
40	 @ dianacnearhos Trust me ,  United is far worse
40	 # Bengals confident theyre ready to win in playoffs and end a 22 - season drought 
40	 @ kemper34 He wasnt
40	So is Shayne Graham trending in both Cincinnati and New Orleans at the moment ? 
40	 @ CEvearitt Luck bounced back from his and has done something that Dalton hasnt  -  -  win a playoff game
40	RT  @ dcmayes  @ joereedy what are the chances Bengalis will play Denver next round if they win ?  & gt ; Divisional ?  Zero . 
40	 @ HoosierLyss  @ burnSTYLEr I wonder if that will be discussed on Pats show
40	 @ mikeschanne  @ BlockedByLance  @ MoEgger1530 And why would I block Mo ? 
40	 @ WaffleHouse16 Agreed and if they do they should
40	 @ WaffleHouse16 If you were smart and read his timeline ,  you will see why I said that .  Win or loss I still have a job to do .  No effect
40	 @ Sammyboy2715 Cant send a tweet like that in the second quarter though
40	 @ WhoDeyJungle Check his timeline
40	I feel bad for  @ adamteicher

40	Going with Colts and Saints today
40	Things a little chippy in Champaign
40	 @ DarrylSlater Third longest active postseason win drought in the league .  You get to see No .  1 tomorrow . 
40	 @ Foster777 that would be Marv
40	For a dramatic representation of how ML press conferences sometimes go 
40	 @ kevingildea Because Marvin always answers questions directly and he never checks me into the boards 3 times a press conference
40	RT  @ jnicklawson :   @ joereedy i remember predicting 0 - 16 3 years ago & gt ; I had 5 - 11 and was being generous
40	 @ kevingildea  @ barnesjb29 Well Kevin you did say I am a  # terriblebeatreporter and  " should get canned " 
40	 @ ReneeMcDowell I know but since Im one of your few Ohio followers I felt like I had to do a rebuttal there
40	RT  @ KyleLawless12 :   @ joereedy chances both TE play tomorrow ?  & gt ; Decent
40	RT  @ nrajag :   @ joereedy what are the odds Newman is active tomorrow ?  & gt ; Slim
40	 @ ReneeMcDowell Umm  .  .  .  
40	RT  @ kevingildea :   @ joereedy are rosters expanded for playoffs ?  Meaning can they activate more then 45 ?  & gt ; No and it has been 46 since 2011
40	3 years ago today was the most contentious and uncomfortable press conference in Bengals history .  Since then :  30 - 20 and 3 playoff trips
40	 @ BPhillips4GG Unfollow button is on the right Adam
40	 @ EffAyBeOh True ,  but if Howard had remained healthy imagine Maualuga back at SAM ,  Tez in Middle and Howard at WIL . 
40	 @ EffAyBeOh Thomas Howard was playing the same spot before he got injured and led the team in tackles . 
40	Can we cue up the Flipper theme for Boyd ? 
40	 @ TimSullivan714 Im all in favor of that if its Matt Millen
40	RT  @ mikeschanne  @ joereedy can you take the ticket avatar down .  .  .  . how about something playoff positive thoughts ?  & gt ;  
40	Played for the safety
40	 @ timothyrh League rules
40	 @ jwheel011  @ Zslowmotion We’ll see
40	 @ iShayWatiWant Chad didn’t buy one single ticket .  It was a stunt
40	RT  @ FartinVanBuren :   @ joereedy Newman listed doubtful .  .  too caught up in the sell out drama to tweet this one ?  & gt ; Did that over an hour ago
40	RT  @ Zslowmotion :   @ joereedy yes or no ?  If you were a betting man ,  is Newman active for Sunday ?  & gt ; No
40	RT  @ Nmbr1WhoDeyFan :   @ joereedy is most disappointed person about sellout .  Now he has nothing to tweet about .  & gt ; really ?  
40	 # Bengals announce P & amp ; G bought the remaining tickets
40	Now I can go back to working Rhime of the Ancient Mariner into my Sunday advance
40	Thank God !   # Bengals announce the game is sold out .  Let freedom ring
40	Newman did practice today for the first time since the injury on Dec .  8 but is still doubtful .  He was limited .   # Bengals
40	 # Bengals Probable :  Collins ,  Crocker ,  Green ,  Kirkpatrick ,  Vinny Rey ,  A . Smith ,  Whitworth
40	 # Bengals injuries Doubt :  Newman ;   ? able :  Cook ,  Eifert ,  Gilberry ,  Gresham  .  .  . 
40	Since there is a  @ BlockedByLance account ,  I cant wait to see if there is a BlockedByReedy or BlockedbyMikeSilver account
40	 @ chgolaw Did I ask you to end all tweets that way ?  I dont think I did
40	 @ chgolaw This just in ,  sometimes players dont work out at one spot and work at others . 
40	 @ tom _ dillingham No ,  I cant
40	 @ IMTTHBY  @ chgolaw Because said tweeter usually grips and moans about everything and also because I hadnt seen that Evan Mathis made it
40	 @ chgolaw Next time when theres more than one Mathis ,  be specific .  I dont know ,  ask Paul Alexander
40	 @ chgolaw Robert Mathis has always played for the Colts
40	 @ adamgould1 Interesting ,  did one better
40	Figured I would switch up the avatar in honor of today

40	If you majored or minored in Literature ,  Sundays  # Bengals -  # Chargers advance is for you .  Plenty of references to a Coleridge poem
40	 @ ScoundrelThomas Glad to hear it .  Bundle up
40	 @ gregmastin Chargers have played well in cold weather
40	 @ ScoundrelThomas Why cant fans step up and purchase tickets for a team that won a division title and finished 8 - 0 at home ? 
40	One of these days I might actually get to write about a game happening on Sunday  # ticketfatigue
40	 @ Deck2424 
40	 @ RobBoyles1418 Kroger didnt .  Large portion but still tickets remaining
40	Plus if Kroger bought all the tickets and there was a sellout ,  dont you think they would have said it ? 
40	And as noted previously ,  Kroger and  # Bengals had been talking for awhile about this
40	From digging around multiple sources ,  the number of locations and past Kroger tix buys ,  indications are Kroger bought more than 1 , 200
40	 @ OchoDirko No
40	More on Krogers purchase of  # Bengals tickets and where military members / veterans can get them on Sat .  
40	 @ gregmastin Duke did yesterday .  It was in todays story
40	 @ DukeGirl8 has to get to an acceptable number first plus in this case they have to pay full price and not 33 cents on the dollar
40	 @ 95RallyCat Did you see what I said five minutes ago ? 
40	 @ AndrewDasNYT 10 , 000 of the best and brightest ? 
40	A Kroger spokeswoman would not say how many tickets were bought
40	 # Bengals tickets will be donated to active service members and veterans at seven Kroger locations in Ohio and Kentucky
40	Kroger and  # Bengals have been working on a ticket buy for awhile plus Kroger has come through in the past
40	Kroger announces it has purchased  " a large quantity of tickets "  for the  # Bengals game
40	 @ MikeGarafolo Last I heard around 5 - 6K
40	Meijer to Kroger  -  -  We stepped up in Indy ,  what are you going to do in Cincy ? 
40	 @ bmychal14 Triplette
40	 @ MrSportsNews Both Indy and GB were in the 3 , 000 range last night which means close to TV station buy .  Cincy has not announced a number yet
40	 @ mpendland44 Thanks for following
40	 @ Fox19Kelly So you drew the short straw and had to do Stadium duty today ? 
40	 @ Mr _ BobMurdock 321 - SEAT buys ad time .  I think most fans know about secondary market
40	Looking at the  @ JimIrsay Twitter feed ,  it sounds like Indy has a sellout
40	 @ mpendland44 Sorry ,  Im in ticket sales question fatigue mode
40	 @ DukeGirl8 Yup .  Welcome to Cincinnati
40	 @ mpendland44 When there is something to announce ,  it will be announced
40	 @ Mr _ BobMurdock Yes ,  it counts but only once  -  -  when it was bought at the team ticket office or Ticketmaster
40	 @ Mr _ BobMurdock Why wouldnt they count ?  They were originally bought by someone
40	 @ jsmytho What do you call him lowering ticket prices in the regular season the past two years ?  Thats not helping the fan base ? 
40	 # Bengals headed to the bubble at UC to practice today
40	 @ jsmytho No it wouldnt because he has done that before for regular - season games .  Hasnt bought all but a significant portion . 
40	 @ johnwilhelm17 Since 2005 .  I get the MB rage ,  just misplaced when it comes to this week
40	 @ gabeworld33 The league has blacked out playoff games before
40	 @ gabeworld33 They’ll announce how many left in the morning . 
40	 @ gabeworld33 No .  Have to opt into it in July .  Plus since the league takes all ticket revenue for postseason ,  not sure it would apply
40	 @ gabeworld33 Yes you are .  Teams can choose whether to opt into the 85 percent rule or not .  Only two teams  ( TB and Miami )  did . 
40	The Nick Saban postgame presser could be just precious tonight
40	 @ FSOhioZJackson Story Time with Uncle Zac ?

40	The last time I saw Katherine Webb in the Superdome — Super Bowl Media Day — she was much happier . 
40	The league ,  not MB ,  gets the ticket revenue .  For the  " I’m not giving MB my money "  segment this is your dream week to go to a game
40	It’s amazing how the people sending me the anti Mike Brown emails tis week are missing one important point with the playoff game  .  .  . 
40	Hell of a pitch and catch there
40	 @ davebiddle  @ BretHoovler If I can’t remember why I blocked you ,  I usually do parole .  I do have certain people blocked who are in for life
40	 @ davebiddle  @ BretHoovler Done
40	 @ HubbuchNYP He’s ripping the kicker’s heart out with his own hands

40	RT  @ JasonAnderson55 :   @ joereedy  @ pdxhero its called multitasking ,  I recommend you try it sometime & gt ; This is called blocking which I recommend
40	 # Bengals are saying that Fifth Third ,  Cincinnati Insurance Co .  ,  Cintas ,  UDF ,  Liberty Mutual / Safeco ,  WCPO and Jeff Ruby have bought tickets
40	 # bengals are saying the 3 , 500 tickets available number per their official twitter account is not valid
40	 # Bengals receive extension until 4 p . m .  tomorrow to get a sellout
40	RT  @ pdxhero :   @ joereedy you have a game prediction joe ?  & gt ; No ,  I’ve been too busy answering blackout questions
40	RT  @ jessemoyer :   @ joereedy Thats Dierdorfs last game ,  right ?  & gt ; Correct
40	Nothing announced yet but signs are pointing to the  # Bengals getting an extension to sell tickets 
40	You people do realize that Motorola was the one who picked up the tab on those tickets that Chad  " bought "  back in 09
40	 @ jamo3 _ 6 _ 0  @ CodyJohnson08 He didnt do it the first time .  Motorola did
40	 @ TyrusHumphrey I mentioned him and Minnesota on Tuesday ,  where have you been ? 
40	Nothing officially announced as of yet ,  but all signs pointing toward an extension  # Bengals
40	RT  @ CodyJohnson08  @ joereedy You think Chad will buy the rest of them tickets ?  & gt ; NO
40	 # Bengals Burfict ,  Peko honored by Cincinnati PFWA with complete voting results

40	Cincinnati PFWA names LB Vontaze Burfict as  # Bengals 2013 MVP and honors DT Domata Peko with Good Guy Media Award
40	If  # Bengals win on Sun .  ,  the announcers for the New England game next Sat .  would be Greg Gumbel / Dan Dierdorf and Allie LaForce  ( sideline ) 
40	Newman and Collins appear to be the only ones not practicing  # Bengals
