45	Love web when it offers fix for boring probs :  fix your trackpad .  Cardigan ,  pipe  & amp ;  garden shed beckon :  
45	Interesting graph .  Cycling safety vs cycling rates by country .  Correlation vs causation 
45	Brilliant piece by  @ IanMartin on the deep need to take offence which I found quite offensive to the easily offended .  .  
45	Wonder if  @ guardian or  @ bbcnews will cover this shocker ?  My guess  " right wing mud - slinging etc .  .  .  .  
45	Dear  @ Times _ CS I know IOS programming is bit much for you but do spell error message correctly .  We see it so often 
45	Brilliant column by  @ matthewsyed “Shock exclusive :   top footballer refuses bribe” on the honesty and integrity that goes unreported
45	Sadly  -  toxic waste story red herring  -  body found on Port Meadow : 
45	Rather nice but uncommunicative police people posted at all the gates onto the Meadow
45	Port Meadow  & amp ;  Wolvercote Common Closed  -  slightly odd reports of toxic waste been dumped ?  More soon .  . 
45	Not “all the news that’s fit to print” for  @ guardian and  @ bbcnews but “all the news that fits our bias” . 
45	2 / 2 …exist for  @ guardian and  @ BBCNews .  See these results .   The metropolitan left lives in a bubble of censorship 
45	1 / 2 The bias of leftist media is often selection bias rather than actual reporting bias .  Many stories simply don’t… 
45	Congrats  @ rowan _ UK  -  Will be glad to see you back in action .  Well done and hope recovery continues to be quick
45	Too often  @ guardian seems driven by mean spirited priggery .  How does naming Marine A help justice ,  victim or him ?  
45	Interested  @ Peston to know whether you find those grammar school stats slanted ,  sloppy or just plain hilarious .  Any def of social mobility ? 
45	Very sweet of you  @ tomrutland .  Used to be Oxford undergraduate  -  sadly many years ago !  Thanks for info and I’ll buy the beer if we chat
45	OK thanks  @ tomrutland so to be clear SU Council voted for it and it is elected by vote ? 
45	Do you have figures on number undergraduates  @ tomrutland  @ ousunews who opted out of OUSU ?  Arguably gives option to express dissent ? 
45	Not saying that  @ tomrutland  @ ousunews living wage has no arguments for it but want to know how OUSU sought vote  /  legitimacy for it ? 
45	Do you have  @ tomrutland a link to show when vote was ,  how many voted and how many in favour  /  against ? 
45	the one  @ tomrutland in the tweet I replied to .  Surely OUSU should represent all not just leftists ?  Proper use of cash and resources ? 
45	Interested  @ ousunews to know what a group which represents all undergraduates is doing involved in partisan campaigns ?  Love to hear logic ? 
45	 @ mrnathannelson  @ leguape Restricted means “not for public release” .  Lowest level of security and really not an issue ! 
45	Surely good schools  @ TristramHuntMP  @ UKLabour should not be political football and you should signal clear definite move from past failure ? 
45	This good news from  @ TristramHuntMP 
45	Good summary here  @ JananGanesh 
45	The science is relatively clear  @ JananGanesh  -  about 50 %  of IQ is inherited 50 %  environment  -  studies of identical twins living separately
45	This is great : 
45	 .  . Effect  @ stephentall vital to startups and business .  Efficient fast transport is one of best investments govt can make  -  physical internet
45	Then  @ stephentall we should close motorway and rail system to revive north !  Sure some wealth is sucked to capital but network  /  cluster…
45	On hs2  @ stephentall go to marseille or aix and see evidence .  People can live in south ,  work in Paris and they do  -  it makes dramatic change
45	 @ stephentall honestly i’d avoid .  Tried it  -  software  & amp ;  usability poor compared to iphone .  Camera better than iphone 5 so go for iphone 5s
45	Then  @ DuncanStott stop attacking the capital of small business with Business Rates and Mansion Tax .  Libdems can be wrong .  In this you are .  . 
45	Why don’t you do a startup  @ DuncanStott ?  Experience often combats prejudice better than debate .  You Cable - istas seem to condemn too much
45	 .  . real people’s jobs  @ DuncanStott and penalise hard work and creativity .  Libdems seems to have a weird obsession with stopping that
45	 .  .  buit tired  @ DuncanStott of leftist policy wonks lecturing us about how world would be better if we paid even more .  Heavy taxes destroy .  .  . 
45	We were discussion business rates  @ DuncanStott  -  think you should admit your theory is incorrect .  Those of us who pay big taxes do get .  .  . 
45	Funny  @ DuncanStott how libdems always believe they smugly know best but seldom have real - world experience .   # swiveleyedtheoreticians
45	 @ DuncanStott 
45	IFS :  “Business property is an input into the production process and ,  on efficiency grounds ,  should not be taxed . ”  @ DuncanStott
45	How can it be borne by the landlord ?   @ DuncanStott .  I pay it not them !  It comes out of my bank account .  If I can’t pay then business bust
45	Surely  @ DuncanStott I should know since I pay them !  Think you’re bit inaccurate on this .  Its a tax on business occupant not landlords
45	“NNDR are payable by the occupiers of the premises”  ( N Norfolk )   @ DuncanStott so business rates paid by me as entrepreneur not landlord
45	Thats a bit unfair  @ DuncanStott !  NNDR paid by those who “occupy non - domestic property”  ( Oxford City Council )  .  Landlords only pay when empty
45	Too many libdem dog whistle policies  @ DuncanStott .  Posturing for political gain means serious damage to small business as tax side - effect
45	Bigco avoids corp tax  @ DuncanStott so target Bigco not small business !  Thought libdems supposed to be liberal  ( Manchester )   & amp ;  like startups
45	whereas  @ DuncanStott corp tax is paid on profits  ( so you have cash to pay it )  and hits bigco not startups .  Libdems bit loopy on property tax
45	If you’d run a startup you’d know that fixed cash costs early on can and do kill .  Simple equation is raise bus rates  =  kill more startups
45	Not sure  @ DuncanStott .  Tenants pay business rates 100 %  whether they make profits or not so it kills struggling businesses . 
45	Genuine question  @ DuncanStott .  Why are business rates better than corp tax ?  Surely as fixed not  % profit they can damage ?  Interested .  . 
45	2 / 2 would  @ michele _ paule  @ Oxford _ Labour hand sweeties to all .  Roll on the utopia of debt ,  economic decay ,  vicious fights of nice Mr Millli
45	1 / 1 Gosh  @ michele _ paule  @ Oxford _ Labour if only Brighton had voted Labour then the sun would shine ,  lambs gambol in the field and Bo Peep…
45	You’re spot on  @ KenBobPryde .  Hadn’t thought of it like that .  Pray that print and journalism can survive else civilisation somewhat stuffed
45	 @ jenkerro  @ leguape they’ll be in roscoff and st Malo  -  local restaurants will have their own fisherman and speak English  -  try viamichelin
45	 @ jenkerro  @ leguape they should be able to put you in touch and tell them it will help exports  -  other route is go via wholesalers
45	 @ jenkerro  @ leguape unlikely to find one who speaks English but tourist office will and they should want publicity 
45	Although this bit Im more culturally tuned in to 
45	Been to many French weddings but never quite get used to cultural difference !  Chateau de Sully ,  Burgundy 
45	 @ ScottSeamons I’m a huge Tebbit fan and love reading or listening to him even when I don’t agree  -  he is echt Essex  -  land of my fathers
45	Not offended  @ ScottSeamons at all  -  swear away .  Pleasures of being Tory is making lefties hot and bothered  -  although persuasion wins votes
45	No  @ ScottSeamons free market is usually best practical solution but requires law ,  intervention and endless change .  It’s a fact not ideology
45	Leftists  @ ScottSeamons so smugly certain of moral superiority that swearing at opponents ok ?  Are good manners reactionary construct comrade ? 
45	Speaking as a  *  *  *  *  Tory  @ ScottSeamons no xenophobia and the free market is not and cannot be an ideology  -  it’s the best practical solution
45	I don’t follow you or  @ lionelbirnie  @ KenBobPryde for political prejudices but cycling pleasure  -  couldn’t you post politics with other acct ? 
45	Sigh  @ KenBobPryde .  Cycling journalists win public followers due to status and exploit it with shouty leftist rants for selfish satisfaction
45	This is really good and hugely reassuring given past Rohan Silva on government IT 
45	Wonder how the literary theory loons would reply to this or would they even try ?  Dinosaurs still in Oxford 
45	 @ LabourLeft  @ michele _ paule is that official party policy ?  Not arguing with your view but interested to know if that is definite party plan ? 
45	Time to trash skyscrapers  -  the tumescence enhancer for developers .  Achitecture still lost in the last century  
45	 @ dalestetina all our thoughts and prayers with you and family  -  sure it will be a long road but you’ll get there and we’re with you . 
45	The Sleepwalkers  @ NickCohen4 by Christopher Clark .  Brilliant read on WWI buildup and uncanny links to pol now ,  Middle East ,  slide to war
45	Just when you thought centre of Birmingham was as ugly  & amp ;  inhuman as it could get ,   @ BhamCityCouncil prove you wrong 
45	Panic over !  I’m back in Oxford after far too long away  -  really quite lovely seen through less familiar eyes and a slightly tired brain
45	De Gaulle wrote the rules  @ afneil of 5th republic .  Whole point was to bin “weak parliamentary democracy”  & amp ;  president close omnipotent
45	Suggest  @ stephenpollard we build framework to fix whole Mid East with partners .  Needs decades of effort and money not few cruise whizz bangs
45	Let’s see  @ stephenpollard the detailed achievable plan  -  the British Army is not paramilitary wing of “progressive” utopian opinion
45	Military action  @ stephenpollard must be defined ,  achievable  & amp ;  have political objective  -  not about making “progressive” liberals feel good
45	This part argument  @ stephenpollard  -  point is where we can act morally  -  practicality all  & amp ;  missiles useless gesture 
45	Late reply  @ ScottSeamons sorry on hols .  Interesting view on BBC and one I hadn’t heard before  -  wonder why it’s stagnated ? 
45	Good balanced piece on fracking by  @ EconSciTech worth reading whatever your opinion 
45	The problem is leaders  @ KenBobPryde that have no military past  /  sense of horror of war  -  what is the pol aim that war might achieve ? 
45	I completely agree with you  @ KenBobPryde
45	That’s interesting  @ ScottSeamons  ( no sarcasm )  .  Why ?  I think bbc is left biased but still support it’s existence although hope more balance
45	No  @ DuncanStott shows public got MPs they voted for not chosen by pol party fiat .  Political parties are necessary fudge not divine right
45	Confused  @ DuncanStott AV referendum was clear .  Do we keep asking until people give “right” result or even impose “progressive” opinion ? 
45	Fascinating article on how animals getting fatter not just us and theories on why  -  worth a read 
45	No coincidence  @ rozoulay  @ yojimbo23  @ benmumbycroft given the quality of founders and tech startups we saw at ISIS presentation  :  -  ) 
45	Hissy fit on hiring of Jim Messina shows UK leftists odd belief that Democrat  =  left  =  libdemlabour .  Whole US politics “right” of UK Tories
45	Also  @ DuncanStott benefits paid only to those who work  /  seek work so seems like Clinton Workfare or IDS Tory reform  -  glad you approve  ;  -  ) 
45	Difference  @ DuncanStott is no technobabble about bitcoin and closer to IDS ‘universal credit’  -  may be good idea  -  little detail in article
45	Are you  @ DuncanStott pointing at Cyprus ,  crippled by euro ,  social breakdown and Russian money as example we should follow ?  Seems bad idea  ;  ) 
45	Drains feeling quite overcome by recent events 
45	St Giles mildly moist a few minutes ago after thunderstorm 
45	2 / 2 Nye Bevan  @ DuncanStott  ( Weekly Argus )  when he was housing minister .  Tragic that today left are “desiccated calculating machines” vs him
45	1 / 2  @ DuncanStott “I am fed up with hearing about workmens types of houses .   .  .  A rabbit - warren accomodation leads to a rabbit - warren mind . 
45	If I did  @ DuncanStott then I apologise  :  )   trying to say that human happiness is aim and is complex  -  formulaic rabbit hutches not answer
45	And you insist on typecasting  @ DuncanStott anyone that doesn’t see reality as 5 - year tractor plan  
45	Sure numbers are roughly correct  @ DuncanStott but you selectively misquote to fit argument which is black  /  white 
45	OCC mocks development that is not leninist - concretist  @ DuncanStott as “windfalls” .  They want big ,  ugly  & amp ;  monotonous .  Ring road  =  River Oder
45	OCC cores strategy  @ DuncanStott only talks “strategic” projects i . e .  housing “estates” or business “parks”  -  no thought to human identity
45	Then the “data”  @ DuncanStott is fiddled like so much of the numbers used by OCC in its development plans  -  facts altered to fit politics
45	Figures can’t be right  @ DuncanStott Castle Mill horror alone is hundreds of flats .  My concern is building beautifully in the right place
45	In Oxford  @ DuncanStott we have leftist big government promoting interest of concreteists  -  think in slogans and despise the little guy
45	 .  @ DuncanStott have you even glanced at Oxford Leninist 10yr plan “Core Strategy” .  No mention of beauty ,  small business or small developers
45	 @ DuncanStott so let concreteists loose on fusty old Oxford ,  make it as ugly and inhumane as Swindon ,  big profit and juicy gerrymandering
45	 @ richardmoore73 that was seriously funny or at Lear funny that I took you seriously ! 
45	 @ KenBobPryde We’re friends with diff politics ,  shared humanity  & amp ;  passion for cycling !  Opinions can be wrong ,  beliefs false but both human
45	 @ richardmoore73 he’s right about rowing .  I’ve done both .  Involves every muscle  & amp ;  spitting blood .  Cycling tough but not as peak extreme
45	 @ marcuschown  @ KenBobPryde Sigh .  Could we hear about TdF today and leave out the Trotskyite tinfoil hat brigade ?  Cycling binds not divides us
45	 @ ProperEllipsis very sorry to hear about  mugging .  Technique seems same as happened 20 years ago to me in parks road !  SOP for E Oxford gang ? 
45	 @ DuncanStott someone can’t be right wing who wants “sunshine from cucumbers” .  Basis of right is empirical dismissal of barmy utopian schemes
45	 @ DuncanStott reason not to support is yet another barmy scheme by “progressive” utopians that would look like the euro’s drunken yob brother
45	Argument  @ DuncanStott  @ yablochko same as Luddites in C18th vs Arkwright’s spinning Jenny .  Fallacy of lump of labour 
45	 @ DuncanStott  @ yablochko guff like that  shows complete intellectual zombyism of left .  Blind assertion with a dusting of pixie tech dust deco
45	 @ DuncanStott  @ yablochko absolute pie - in - the - sky wibble .  Try constructing rational argument not mashing utopia with tech  & amp ;  declaring victory ! 
45	 @ Ox _ Bex  @ TonyOX3  @ oxchris  @ Gatineau1 Touché .  Tu es la reine Oxfordienne des snobs du pain gastronomique .  Chapeau ! 
45	 @ TonyOX3 no but there is one baker there that cuts the mustard when it comes to croissants
45	 @ Ox _ Bex  @ TonyOX3  @ oxchris  @ Gatineau1 that is completely understandable  -  you are completely forgiven !   ;  -  )  Even we food snobs are human …
45	Should also say  @ gatineau1 make the best croissants this side of Dijon  -  certainly nothing in the UK and large parts of France comes close
45	 @ TonyOX3  @ Ox _ Bex  @ oxchris no serious Frenchperson would ever buy bread in a “supermarché”  -  de Gaulle would turn in his grave  @ gatineau1
45	 @ TonyOX3  @ Ox _ Bex  @ oxchris the only good bread in Oxford is made by 
45	 @ TonyOX3  @ alumnioxford  @ DuncanStott Understand .  Always difficult to punish big - co or big - gov since public pays but they can’t be above law
45	Castle Milll  @ DuncanStott typical of prosaic lack of ambition in UK architecture  -  time to reintroduce beauty as planning aim  @ AlumniOxford
45	 @ TonyOX3  @ DuncanStott OCC is hoarding big cash reserves and has insurance .  Public wont be hit .  Time for new demolition policy  @ AlumniOxford
45	Agreed  @ DuncanStott but they should be beautiful ,  well - designed and not looming 3 storeys over Port Meadow ! 
45	I’m own a house  @ DuncanStott so no rent although bank has big slice for startup loan !  Paid for it from sale of hitech startup . 
45	Banks have and never will lend to startups  @ DuncanStott .  We risk our houses each time we start a new business .  Mansion tax needs rethink
45	Houses are main collateral for loans to startups  @ DuncanStott  -  we need to limit actual demand not engage in class war
45	Do abandon  @ DuncanStott your sanctimonious superiority .  Last flat we lived made family homeless under Shelter definitions  # prolierthanthou
45	Campaigners for concrete  @ duncanstott always talk supply never limiting demand .  Immigration of past decade and family breakup are left taboo
45	If Oxford conservationists  @ DuncanStott had not fought for decades then it would be as ugly as Swindon .  Progress does not mean concrete
45	Loggers in Amazon  & amp ;  Java  @ DuncanStott feel same about nimby natives .  Why not try to alter approach and understand not condemn opponents ? 
45	2 / 2 res pop .  Can’t build 300 , 000 houses so have to build in county towns .  Objective of left is swell Oxford to grow power of leftists
45	1 / 2 Facts on prices are clear  @ DuncanStott but there are many poss solutions like building in satellite towns .  Oxford has working pop 3x…
45	Those of us  @ DuncanStott want preserve beauty and environment know balance needed with development .  To you every issue black and white ? 
45	 @ ianhudspeth you forgot Chris Froome in yellow at TDF !  Much more important to we hippy cyclist types
45	 @ spokesmen best wishes on a speedy recovery  -  miss your commentary and hope what’s been a tough year gets lot better .  We do care about you
45	 @ Vaughters  @ delbified surely fair Moncoutié ,  clean super talented rider to point out the less scrupulous who destroyed career ?   # moralcourage
45	Good article on banks .  As a reformed ex - banker ,  the last para is bit strong but agree with much of the rest 
45	Like to see more hedgehogs again ?   @ mattwridley on natural balance ,  badgers and biodiversity 
45	 @ kickoutbnp Is your hate morally superior to the hate you claim to fight ?   -  I think its the fight you love not peace  @ BegsAli  @ tonybrett
45	 @ kickoutbnp Your attacks on Tony  & amp ;  other decent people  ( not EDL )  make me think you are as bigoted as those you oppose  @ BegsAli  @ tonybrett
45	 @ kickoutbnp understand your view but don’t agree demonising opponents works  -  you alienate reasonable people like us  @ BegsAli  @ tonybrett
45	 @ barnthebarn Could you DM me your email ? 
45	Excellent piece in  @ TheOxfordMail in support of  @ tonybrett  -  good to see paper standing for democracy and tolerance
45	Question  @ BegsAli  -  why don’t you oppose Marxists too  -  murdered many more than fascists and much more powerful and prevalent today ? 
45	I apologise  @ BegsAli .  Was answering  @ kickoutbnp .  he hasn’t aligned himself or supported EDL in any way
45	 @ kickoutbnp  @ BegsAli Whole point of the Niemoller quote is that totalitarians will pick on any group eventually ,  like you do .   @ tonybrett
45	 @ BegsAli  @ kickoutbnp Don’t think bullying me  ( yet )  but  @ tonybrett .  You seem to believe that anyone questions UAF is evil and you perfect
45	Hmmm  @ kickoutbnp  @ BegsAli 
45	No  @ kickoutbnp .  I agree the BNP is racist but  @ tonybrett is not .  He’s a good man and you are a bully
45	No  @ kickoutbnp I’m trying to defend the decent and honest man  @ tonybrett you are attacking and trying to destroy  -  I think you’re a bully
45	Or  @ kickoutbnp are you so perfect that anyone who disagrees with you is automatically evil ?  Sounds quite totalitarian to me .   @ tonybrett
45	 @ kickoutbnp Oh gosh ,  then you are wrong .   @ tonybrett does not stand with the EDL ,  just disagrees with you  -  can’t you spot the difference ? 
45	What  @ kickoutbnp  @ tonybrett is a very good councillor .  Lib Dem  ( unlike me )  how on earth can you call him a hatemonger ?  Do need to calm down
45	 @ spineynorman78  @ BegsAli Ad Hominem attacks on those with different opinions are roots of totalitarian behaviour  -  be nice .   @ tonybrett
45	 @ spineynorman78  @ BegsAli Very dangerous to assume that only you are right  /  virtuous  -  I’m often wrong and change my mind .   @ tonybrett
45	 @ spineynorman78  @ BegAli I called  @ tonybrett a hero not him !  If you believe in tolerance  & amp ;  free speech then argue your point not attack
45	 @ tonybrett done
45	Too often  @ tonybrett only the fanatics organise  -  thoughtful voice isn’t heard  -  they are tribal  & amp ;  we’re too quiet in response
45	We need to give you broader support  @ tonybrett  -  been thinking for some time that Oxford needs campaign for freedom speech  & amp ;  real liberalism
45	You’re a hero  @ tonybrett .  The aggression  & amp ;  intolerance of those who claim to stand for peace  & amp ;  tolerance ,  needs to be questioned  & amp ;  changed
45	Impressed  @ tonybrett superb piece  -  well done !  Small acts of moral courage like yours are what makes a healthy community tick . 
45	Truth is complex  @ michele _ paule unions are / were often against meritocracy .  Print unions were ,  teaching unions can be now in my opinion
