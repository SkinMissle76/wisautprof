-0.26	 @ bobblybibbly yeah I love Hey Big Spender .  Watched him win a few times .  U cud pick 6 that could win !  !  Ive a couple EW too
-0.26	 @ bobblybibbly I generally back him but hes a lot of weight but a legend of a horse
-0.26	 @ stevielovesgaga Im loving it
-0.26	 @ bobblybibbly I got him at 14 - 1 weeeee
-0.26	 @ bobblybibbly in a lesser race hed carry 7 lb less than today -  I wouldnt fancy him tbh
-0.26	 @ bobblybibbly think so -  its to do with the min weight carried in the race and is carrying more weight ie 7 lb than his true weight . 
-0.26	 @ bobblybibbly I think its basically hes carrying 7lb more than he would have done due to his official ratings compared to other horses
-0.26	Im not backing any favourites today .  Just stuck a pin in the welsh national but always back  @ Tidal _ Bay and gone with Unioniste in Lexus
-0.26	 @ MrMoves poor lad .  Hopefully they can sort it -  Denman had a similar thing I think
