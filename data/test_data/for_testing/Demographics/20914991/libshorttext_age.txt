-0.32	 @ Bass _ Wakil I almost didnt see Jay and it would prevent the Dan  / Amy issue

-0.32	 @ Bass _ Wakil 
-0.32	 @ iamlouisesmith  * homer voice *  in case you cant tell ,  I was being sarcastic .

-0.32	 @ insanewitgenius I think it was good .  Its one of those films I think you need to think about for a while after . 
-0.32	In other news ,  Home Alone owes a lot to that film . 
-0.32	Ive been trying to think of a way to describe that sort of thing for ages and it just clicked . 
-0.32	A review I read afterwards described the difficulty of reconciling your emotional and intellectual reactions as a key point . 
-0.32	Earlier I watched the original Straw Dogs for the first time .  It was one of those films that is awkward to watch but well made .

-0.32	 @ Pulpsong  @ Bass _ Wakil  @ KelvBrown is it the fact that Indiana Jones presence makes no difference to the film ? 
-0.32	Its ok to call in to work and say youre not coming in because youve not yet watched Muppets Christmas Carol yet this year ,  right ? 
-0.32	 @ zoe _ skellington apparently the road is closed and its not possible to get there
-0.32	That 60 minutes or so saved me several hours .  Thanks ,  Matt and Trey . 
-0.32	I have not seen or read Game of Thrones but I have seen the South Park episodes and now I know exactly what happens .  Nothing . 
-0.32	 @ emslj no ,  you are amazing .  Just lacking in the film department .  But you make up for it in many other ways . 
-0.32	 @ emslj have you only just watched that too ? 
-0.32	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux oh right .  yeah .  i bet theres still no pandas in it ,  though ?
