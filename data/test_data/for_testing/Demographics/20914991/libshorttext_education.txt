2	 @ JamesandBeard  @ garabe the bit where his dad tells supes not to save him to hide his secret . 
2	 @ garabe  @ JamesandBeard theres one nice bit but ultimately it needs more batman . 
2	 @ Damien _ sprigg  @ bringthewayne these could be long drawn out negotiations  if theyre not willing to give us Rooney in exchange . 
2	 @ BarneyBebop  @ mandawyn Woof !  Hey Barney !  Hows life treating you ?

2	FA CUP 3RD ROUND DAY !  Need to clean out guinea pigs ,  exercise ,  shower and eat lunch in the next hour . 
2	 @ charliefowlerrr why not  :  ( 
2	 @ Lizzie _ Pope  @ bananasdaisys yes .  Like that ! 
2	To make the sender think they did something stupid / crazy / embarassing
2	What is the funniest response I could give to a text which says  " how did you know I was drunk last night ?   " 
2	 @ beaumont _ ali let me know if it works .  I need a new gimmick . 
2	 @ voose _ lagina  @ insanewitgenius you made the mistake of mentioning it over lunch when I was bored . 
2	 @ beaumont _ ali only after 3 coffees . 
2	 @ voose _ lagina  @ insanewitgenius let me just check in the dictionary that I havent misunderstood the meaning of the word hilarious . 
2	Ive forgotten what day of the week it is .  Tomorrow will be a nice surprise Friday . 
2	 @ voose _ lagina amazing weather .  I was pretty much wet through .  Interesting start to the year .

2	 @ jodiedoubleday yeah ,  it was our 5th or 6th date .  shes off to cameroon in spring for a year and a half .  shame ,  she was nice but not The One
2	Hadnt actually walked along white cliffs before though and it was an enjoyable if wet and painful experience . 
2	If we had decided that first ,   I could have stayed in the warm watching who framed Roger rabbit . 
2	2014 so far .  Go for a walk along white cliffs in hail and fall in the mud at suggestion of girl .  Then decide it wont work between us . 
2	 @ jodiedoubleday i woke up before them all . 
2	Its 2am .   I have a date at 12  how many alarms should I set ? 
2	I won 3rd prize in a drawing competition by entering a blank bit of paper with the title snow .

2	5th greatest accomplishment of 2013 :  driving all around Britain without getting lost .  I have no sense of direction .

2	 @ LokoStef17  @ bringthewayne relatively to what theyre like now theyre immaculate ! 
2	 @ inTirNaNog lets go with poetry .  Cobain ,  Hendrix and Morrison had been dead 3 .  Does he want you to do more music too ? 
2	 @ LokoStef17  @ bringthewayne but the council pitches there are horrid .  Much worse than Vicky rec
2	 @ LokoStef17  @ bringthewayne theres the main one which is the actual Folkestone ground and theres 3 which are now where astro turfs are
2	 @ johnnyxl nope
2	 @ bananasdaisys I may have one for you tomorrow . 
2	 @ bringthewayne compare that to the polo ground nowadays . 
2	I will consult  @ bananasdaisys  ,   @ Lizzie _ Pope and  @ iamlouisesmith to get them to make life decisions for me . 
2	In other news ,   diary started .  I have set me 9 goals for 2014 .  And am breaking them done into monthly chunks . 
2	I love me a bit of local history . 
2	 @ rhysdgriffiths Im pretty chuffed for him . 
2	 @ emslj naughty Emma .  Get scrubbing . 
2	 @ Pulpsong silly owain .  Fanta isnt water . 
2	 @ bananasdaisys  @ iamlouisesmith  @ Lizzie _ Pope haha .  nothing exciting has happened today .  .  .  .  I will have a think .  but I like Lizzies idea . 
2	And therefore hopefully make better choices and make more of my life .  Will see how it goes .  I give it a week .  Tops . 
2	I am going to start keeping a diary .  I figure having to justify my actions to myself will make me assess whether they were the best choice . 
2	 @ lmgiles88 you packers as well then ? 
2	 @ emslj are they better than Mark Hoppus ? 
2	 @ lmgiles88 sounds like it was quite exciting ! 
2	I want to see if the Packers make the playoffs but not as much as I want to sleep .  Im such a hardcore fan . 
2	 @ bananasdaisys  @ Lizzie _ Pope the Vikings fed their children beer as it was healthier than water .  You could be a warrior ! 
2	 @ bananasdaisys Ill sponsor you if you drink nothing except beer
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil but its always when I have a bad guy that we re - do it .  i like being bad . 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil I almost didnt see Jay and it would prevent the Dan  / Amy issue
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil not a massive issue but was thinking it might be worth bad guys putting up thumbs when they open their eyes . 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil 
2	 @ iamlouisesmith  * homer voice *  in case you cant tell ,  I was being sarcastic . 
2	 @ iamlouisesmith Look , the sooner you accept that you personally caused all of the rains to come & amp ; punish these people , the sooner we can move on
2	Bit gutted that Poundland hasnt got a sale on .  I was hoping to pick up some bargains . 
2	My neighbours have dressed up nice & amp ; spent thousands on their wedding .  In contrast ,  I am going to sit my pants & amp ; play WWE2008 that I got for 50p
2	 @ johnnyxl its a she .  .  .  .  but thats not the only reason your joke fails  : p
2	I have just finished re - reading the book thief .  I must be getting sentimental in my old age as it really hit me this time . 
2	 @ insanewitgenius I think it was good .  Its one of those films I think you need to think about for a while after . 
2	In other news ,  Home Alone owes a lot to that film . 
2	Ive been trying to think of a way to describe that sort of thing for ages and it just clicked . 
2	A review I read afterwards described the difficulty of reconciling your emotional and intellectual reactions as a key point . 
2	Earlier I watched the original Straw Dogs for the first time .  It was one of those films that is awkward to watch but well made . 
2	 @ DuncanMoris I might do another later if Im feeling frisky . 
2	 @ DuncanMoris i hope you enjoy my flusticle . 
2	 @ SamuraiGopher  @ TheChambersBar I definitely won a hangover
2	I am currently in shock  that  @ TheChambersBar Boxing Day quiz actually played out in full . 
2	Deal or No Deal should actually take 2 minutes .  And people should not be applauded for opening a box . 
2	For the record ,   I want to state that the only reason I lost scrabble today was because my parents change the rules . 
2	 @ RhianBWatts I have been thinking about it all day and that might be it . 
2	 @ petefrasermusic I have just watched it .  It doesnt really give away much that you dont already know .  Its just like the warm - up guy .

2	Might have to go baby and watch the last few series now .  .  .  . 
2	Havent watched doctor who in ages .  His assistant is quite cute
2	 @ voose _ lagina consider yourself well shunned
2	Watching a celebrity TV show and I know who half the celebrities are .  This is unprecedented . 
2	 @ curlybeach I wanted to disagree but I think youre right . 
2	 @ SarahBDemented that sucks  :  ( 
2	 @ mandawyn has be been downgraded from fiance because of that comment ? 
2	 @ jsullivanwhu Messi ? 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil youre a Christmas . 
2	Christmas is confusing me this year . 
2	I also cant see why they leak the Queen s speech . 
2	Ive still not worked out the moral message behind the Gruffalo . 
2	First task of Christmas accomplished .  Browse Homebase sale .   # grownup
2	 @ alicepopey lack of willpower .  I am at home .

2	 @ beaumont _ ali double win .  Can I have some posh wine ? 
2	 @ beaumont _ ali it is christmas ! 
2	Ok .  Its the bit when Michael Caine dances along with Christmas Present in a horrendous way . 
2	LIGHT THE LAMP NOT THE RAT ! 
2	 @ beaumont _ ali hey I have 2 guinea pigs to look after .  I have responsibilities too . 
2	I probably change my mind about my favourite bit of this film every five minutes .  At the moment its when Rizzo kisses Gonzos nose
2	 @ beaumont _ ali youre starting late . 
2	Beaker totally flips Scrooge the bird .   # muppetschristmascarol
2	Enough sentiment .  Pass the rum . 
2	I dont think I appreciate enough having my family live so close .  Hope everyone gets home safe and without too many delays .

2	 @ nogpob I think the Pope has tried to pre  - empt this and ruin your day
2	 @ Pulpsong  @ Bass _ Wakil  @ KelvBrown is it the fact that Indiana Jones presence makes no difference to the film ? 
2	Its ok to call in to work and say youre not coming in because youve not yet watched Muppets Christmas Carol yet this year ,  right ? 
2	 @ zoe _ skellington apparently the road is closed and its not possible to get there
2	That 60 minutes or so saved me several hours .  Thanks ,  Matt and Trey . 
2	I have not seen or read Game of Thrones but I have seen the South Park episodes and now I know exactly what happens .  Nothing . 
2	 @ emslj no ,  you are amazing .  Just lacking in the film department .  But you make up for it in many other ways . 
2	 @ emslj have you only just watched that too ? 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux oh right .  yeah .  i bet theres still no pandas in it ,  though ? 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux did you say something about this ?  im not sure I was paying attention . 
2	 @ petefrasermusic so tempting to plagarise your retweeting now .  .  .  . 
2	 @ vikkistone cracking pins ,   luv
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux  .  .  .  a decline in ability ,  possibly never to win again .  cf King of Tokyo . 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux I am a little bit worried that my cockiness is due to my initial natural affinity for Japanese games before .  .  . 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux I think I missed my calling .  I should be gardener to the Emperor . 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ hannahlyonwall  @ LuciasMalcolm NO ONE COMMAND PANDA AND GARDENER AS GOOD AS I
2	 @ emslj I like your new photo ,  all nice and bright  :  ) 
2	 @ emslj Told you so . 
2	 @ dancork Well .  .  .  it has landed .  Not in the standard way though .  From about 2 cm I can land it ok .  I should maybe read the manual .  .  . 
2	 @ dancork so far ,  I think the helicopter has only crashed maybe 50 times .  Its pretfy resilient . 
2	 @ Bass _ Wakil I think I have an affinity with pandas . 
2	 @ emslj itll be fucking amazing . 
2	 @ garabe 25p for zoo ander ?  Mental .

2	 @ lukemckinney although it might be worth sorting out a VPN in advance . 
2	 @ lukemckinney you can do it fine .  From what I recall social media is blocked but I didnt have any other issues . 
2	Saying youre cool about something you are totally freaking out about is the new black . 
2	Considering using guinea pigs birthday as an excuse for a party / to get drunk . 
2	 @ voose _ lagina youre making this too easy now . 
2	 @ Herring1967 Dont listen to him  -  Ill do it for Â£1 , 000 a week !  AND I have on my CV scoring a hat - trick when I was 11 .  Beat that ,  Herring !

2	 @ voose _ lagina its a sort of apathetic determination
2	 @ Boo _ Gray1983 dont fuck up ! 
2	 @ voose _ lagina MERRY CHRISTMAS ! 
2	 @ voose _ lagina I never got any .  Even on my birthday .  Blatant favoritism . 
2	Earlier today ,  my colleague told me she cant stand the Muppets .  I wasnt able to speak to her for half an hour . 
2	OH MY GOD .  Should totally have been watching West Ham v Spurs . 
2	 @ zoe _ skellington I am rather jealous .

2	BLOG :  I have been thinking about this for a while .  Who can you trust to be your role model ?   
2	 @ Coullj  @ KelvBrown did they fire you because they realised they could change light bulbs themselves ? 
2	 @ Scriblit I think one died and then the other went a few days later with a broken heart . 
2	Ive only just noticed the similarities between Elf and Rudolf The red nose reindeer .
