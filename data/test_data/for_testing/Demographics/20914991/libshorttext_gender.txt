-1	 @ bananasdaisys  @ Lizzie _ Pope the Vikings fed their children beer as it was healthier than water .  You could be a warrior ! 
-1	 @ bananasdaisys Ill sponsor you if you drink nothing except beer
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil but its always when I have a bad guy that we re - do it .  i like being bad . 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil I almost didnt see Jay and it would prevent the Dan  / Amy issue
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil not a massive issue but was thinking it might be worth bad guys putting up thumbs when they open their eyes . 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil 
-1	 @ iamlouisesmith  * homer voice *  in case you cant tell ,  I was being sarcastic . 
-1	 @ iamlouisesmith Look , the sooner you accept that you personally caused all of the rains to come & amp ; punish these people , the sooner we can move on
-1	Bit gutted that Poundland hasnt got a sale on .  I was hoping to pick up some bargains .

-1	I have just finished re - reading the book thief .  I must be getting sentimental in my old age as it really hit me this time . 
-1	 @ insanewitgenius I think it was good .  Its one of those films I think you need to think about for a while after . 
-1	In other news ,  Home Alone owes a lot to that film . 
-1	Ive been trying to think of a way to describe that sort of thing for ages and it just clicked . 
-1	A review I read afterwards described the difficulty of reconciling your emotional and intellectual reactions as a key point . 
-1	Earlier I watched the original Straw Dogs for the first time .  It was one of those films that is awkward to watch but well made . 
-1	 @ DuncanMoris I might do another later if Im feeling frisky . 
-1	 @ DuncanMoris i hope you enjoy my flusticle . 
-1	 @ SamuraiGopher  @ TheChambersBar I definitely won a hangover
-1	I am currently in shock  that  @ TheChambersBar Boxing Day quiz actually played out in full . 
-1	Deal or No Deal should actually take 2 minutes .  And people should not be applauded for opening a box . 
-1	For the record ,   I want to state that the only reason I lost scrabble today was because my parents change the rules . 
-1	 @ RhianBWatts I have been thinking about it all day and that might be it . 
-1	 @ petefrasermusic I have just watched it .  It doesnt really give away much that you dont already know .  Its just like the warm - up guy .

-1	LIGHT THE LAMP NOT THE RAT ! 
-1	 @ beaumont _ ali hey I have 2 guinea pigs to look after .  I have responsibilities too . 
-1	I probably change my mind about my favourite bit of this film every five minutes .  At the moment its when Rizzo kisses Gonzos nose
-1	 @ beaumont _ ali youre starting late . 
-1	Beaker totally flips Scrooge the bird .   # muppetschristmascarol
-1	Enough sentiment .  Pass the rum . 
-1	I dont think I appreciate enough having my family live so close .  Hope everyone gets home safe and without too many delays .

-1	 @ nogpob I think the Pope has tried to pre  - empt this and ruin your day
-1	 @ Pulpsong  @ Bass _ Wakil  @ KelvBrown is it the fact that Indiana Jones presence makes no difference to the film ? 
-1	Its ok to call in to work and say youre not coming in because youve not yet watched Muppets Christmas Carol yet this year ,  right ? 
-1	 @ zoe _ skellington apparently the road is closed and its not possible to get there
-1	That 60 minutes or so saved me several hours .  Thanks ,  Matt and Trey . 
-1	I have not seen or read Game of Thrones but I have seen the South Park episodes and now I know exactly what happens .  Nothing . 
-1	 @ emslj no ,  you are amazing .  Just lacking in the film department .  But you make up for it in many other ways . 
-1	 @ emslj have you only just watched that too ? 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux oh right .  yeah .  i bet theres still no pandas in it ,  though ? 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux did you say something about this ?  im not sure I was paying attention . 
-1	 @ petefrasermusic so tempting to plagarise your retweeting now .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ vikkistone cracking pins ,   luv
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux  .  .  .  a decline in ability ,  possibly never to win again .  cf King of Tokyo . 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux I am a little bit worried that my cockiness is due to my initial natural affinity for Japanese games before .  .  . 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ Helionflux I think I missed my calling .  I should be gardener to the Emperor . 
-1	 @ Bass _ Wakil  @ hannahlyonwall  @ LuciasMalcolm NO ONE COMMAND PANDA AND GARDENER AS GOOD AS I
-1	 @ emslj I like your new photo ,  all nice and bright  :  )

-1	Saying youre cool about something you are totally freaking out about is the new black .
