-0.24	IF ONLY FOR A SECOND  /  /  Mimi Foundation  /  /  UK :  
-0.24	 @ Danielf90 Some hospitals more than others .  And what nonsense that it should be about buzzwords rather than need ,  but too often true . 
-0.24	The  # MedicalCouncilonAlcohol has some great resources and competitions for students and trainees  # RCPsychDebate 
-0.24	As deterrent ¬£10 doesnt seem much  ( barely packet of fags )  .  Fear might seem quite good value and perversely justify non - emergency use .   # NHS

-0.24	Excellent  @ guardian article about the good work of  @ TurningPointUKs peer mentors .  Gold standard ,  however ,  would be qualified nursing staff . 
-0.24	Extremely unhelpful / misleading of  @ BBCr4today  @ BBCBreaking to repeat incorrect statements re :  antidepressant addiction  ( ‚â† tranquillisers ) 
-0.24	Finally ,   @ BBCFileon4 ,  not accurate description of physical / psychological harms of meth from your speaker  -  more than just ageing and candy ! 
-0.24	 @ Danielf90 Strangely though ,  often it does .  In psychiatry ,  for instance . 
-0.24	 @ mattyheron i do lots of work in ICU  -  delirium rife and many pts not unconscious .  .  .
