-1	IF ONLY FOR A SECOND  /  /  Mimi Foundation  /  /  UK :  
-1	 @ Danielf90 Some hospitals more than others .  And what nonsense that it should be about buzzwords rather than need ,  but too often true . 
-1	The  # MedicalCouncilonAlcohol has some great resources and competitions for students and trainees  # RCPsychDebate 
-1	As deterrent ¬£10 doesnt seem much  ( barely packet of fags )  .  Fear might seem quite good value and perversely justify non - emergency use .   # NHS
-1	 .  @ BBCr4today What actually is squally rain ?  There seems to be a lot of it about today . 
-1	Antidepressant use on the rise in rich countries ,  OECD finds

-1	 @ soukici  @ mattyheron  @ JonBradfield my 3 year old godson thought it was the best thing EVER . 
-1	 @ Danielf90 Thats because the local commissioners and hospital didnt purchase a proper Liaison service .  Its coming soon though .

-1	August Osage County Official Trailer 
-1	Proposal  -  why dont we instead inform pts the actual cost to  # NHS of attendances  ( staff ,  tests / scans ,  transport  & amp ; c )  on discharge summary ? 
-1	Apparently I value :  assertiveness ,  coping with uncertainty ,  out of hours work ,  educating pts ,  teams ,  ability cope with imprecision  =  my job ! 
-1	 @ myersjoel A character - limit derived cull .

-1	Thanks Sarah Hilton for the crockery  -  think you have  @ mikeyrayment down to a T !  
-1	Excellent  @ guardian article about the good work of  @ TurningPointUKs peer mentors .  Gold standard ,  however ,  would be qualified nursing staff . 
-1	Extremely unhelpful / misleading of  @ BBCr4today  @ BBCBreaking to repeat incorrect statements re :  antidepressant addiction  ( ‚â† tranquillisers ) 
-1	Finally ,   @ BBCFileon4 ,  not accurate description of physical / psychological harms of meth from your speaker  -  more than just ageing and candy ! 
-1	 @ Danielf90 Strangely though ,  often it does .  In psychiatry ,  for instance . 
-1	 @ mattyheron i do lots of work in ICU  -  delirium rife and many pts not unconscious .  .  .
