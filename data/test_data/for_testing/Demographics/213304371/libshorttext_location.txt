17	 @ DrEdWild Cripes are you complaining again ?   @ domcavlan will start online - bullying you too if not careful . Caution :  
17	‚ÄòMental health trusts delivering better value‚Äô :   @ NHSEngland responds to evidence of falling budgets 
17	 @ Danielf90 Indeed .  A failure of your trust  ( and their commissioners )  to appreciate the huge mental health morbidity in their hospital
17	 @ domcavlan  @ mikeyrayment phew .  that means i dont have to have to source a border terrier as well as a spaniel .  
17	 @ myersjoel Youre welcome  : D

17	 @ AliceLomax  @ beaconuk  @ PaulBurstow Id guess it would be as bad in physical health setting where I often see lack of discharge planning ? 
17	Too often experienced drug / alcohol nurses in ED replaced by  ( cheaper )  workers who cant offer staff / pts adequate support  @ guardian
17	 @ domcavlan probably both .  but the bathroom is hideous .   @ mikeyrayment has plans for a total refurb . 
17	 @ Psycle _ Doc Congratulations on the conference today  -  couldnt stay all day but it had a great buzz

17	Interesting evening with  @ victoriajhume at  @ ExploreWellcome for preview of Foreign Bodies exhibition 
17	Disappointing lack of  # mental health in Phase 1 of  # Keogh Review of Emergency Care .  Vital in  " supporting self care "  and need crisis pathways
17	 @ Danielf90  @ NHSE _ Dean .  .  .  not a skeleton service .  Absolutely doctors ,  but other teams too ,  sure . 
17	 @ WesselyS If wasnt so depressing it would be comic .  Meanwhile ,  was pleased to see you on ballot paper yesterday .  .  .  good luck !   # castmyvote

17	 @ DrEdWild  @ drjustinW Ill DM you . 
17	And ,   @ BBCFileon4 ,  majority of problematic users of NPS  /  meth still working .  Not the typical addiction story but can be just as harmful . 
17	 @ AlexBThomson How did it go yesterday ?   * fingers crossed * 
17	Accidentally find myself elected to be Secretary  /  Chair - Elect of the  @ RCPsych Liaison TNC .   # WillIEverLearn ?

17	 .  @ mikeyrayment and I go out to avoid the clich√©d  # DrWho tosh and who do we bump in to ?   ( cc  @ pmhaydock )  
17	Can‚Äôt help but observe that  @ mikeyrayment looks astonishingly like Princess Jazzbeard

17	Twitter does sometimes make me smile .  
17	Fantastic evening at  @ hinthuntlondon and already booked for Level 2  @ drjustinw  @ mikeyrayment 
17	The shoeshop queue was enormous ,  but N5s Imelda Marcos  (  @ mikeyrayment )  didnt need to resort to dirty protest  :  - 0 
17	I knew it !   " Alzheimers patients brains boosted by belting out Sound of Music "

17	 @ DrEdWild No backup required thanks .  Though if I can find an AMHP then we can detain  @ domcavlan for the protection of others . 
17	 @ mattyheron wheres Liaison œà  ?   * storms off sobbing * 
17	IF ONLY FOR A SECOND  /  /  Mimi Foundation  /  /  UK :  
17	 @ Danielf90 Some hospitals more than others .  And what nonsense that it should be about buzzwords rather than need ,  but too often true . 
17	The  # MedicalCouncilonAlcohol has some great resources and competitions for students and trainees  # RCPsychDebate 
17	As deterrent ¬£10 doesnt seem much  ( barely packet of fags )  .  Fear might seem quite good value and perversely justify non - emergency use .   # NHS
17	 .  @ BBCr4today What actually is squally rain ?  There seems to be a lot of it about today . 
17	Antidepressant use on the rise in rich countries ,  OECD finds 
17	 @ AlexBThomson I note a subtle change in your LinkedIn profile  -  does this augur good news ?  Bravo if so !  Who else ?  Now ,  about that merger .  .  . 
17	 .  @ WLLiaisonPsych out in force today at  @ Psychiatry2020 Trainee Conference :   @ drchrishilton  # Liaisonœà workshop and Amrit Sachar on  # PhysCAT
17	Enjoyed meeting  @ RoehamptonUni therapy students today to teach about psychiatric model and debate pros and cons of labelling and meds  # DSM5
17	 @ guytnoble  @ victoriajhume They did .  Fantastic stuff .  And a great and important left field at an academic conference ! 
17	Bit disappointed by  @ BBCFileon4  -  failed to highlight the massive harms of crystal methamphetamine in some UK subpopulations eg MSM  /  HIV
17	
17	 @ Tim _ JR _ Hill A vivid metaphor !

17	 .  @ bmj _ latest  -  No  # MentalHealth category ?  So much for  # Parity !   # TheBMJAwards  @ RCPsych Details here :

17	 @ Danielf90  @ NHSE _ Dean But Dan ,  its not about juniors working more ,  its about all of us working more effectively . 
17	RT :   @ myersjoel :  So Ive been busy all day .  2 thoughts :  1 )  No Shit Sherlock .  2 )  what a little star . 
17	 @ soukici  @ mattyheron  @ JonBradfield my 3 year old godson thought it was the best thing EVER . 
17	 @ Danielf90 Thats because the local commissioners and hospital didnt purchase a proper Liaison service .  Its coming soon though . 
17	 @ domcavlan  @ mikeyrayment glad you could be there for him in his hour of need .  .  .  
17	 .  @ annacfryer fantastic to be at a conference where the programme includes both a National Clinical Director  @ DrG _ NHS and a Core Trainee ! 
17	 @ DrGrumble More than one per hospital ?   # overkill
17	Both  @ RCPsychs Sue Bailey ,  and Broadway /  @ Disney / MurderSheWrotes Angela Lansbury Damed in the NY Honours .   # Bravi 
17	 @ Danielf90  @ silv24  @ thomjcarter  @ ncl _ medic The whole point of 7 day working is to have the AHP depts operating .  More important than docs
17	 .  @ imperialcollege Emergency Medicine Professor Emeritus Robin Touquet giving the  # MaxGlatt lecture at Medical Council on  # Alcohol Symposium
17	The dangers of social media :   " Britons drunk in three quarters of Facebook photos "

17	 @ cpeedell  @ NHAparty Would love to see this graph going back to the pre - Thatcher years and upto current gov .  Considerable squeeze even so . 
17	August Osage County Official Trailer 
17	Proposal  -  why dont we instead inform pts the actual cost to  # NHS of attendances  ( staff ,  tests / scans ,  transport  & amp ; c )  on discharge summary ? 
17	Apparently I value :  assertiveness ,  coping with uncertainty ,  out of hours work ,  educating pts ,  teams ,  ability cope with imprecision  =  my job ! 
17	 @ myersjoel A character - limit derived cull .

17	 @ LAHFArtsHealth :   @ bsosinowicz  @ victoriajhume  @ guytnoble Sorry to miss you all  -  was caught up at work . 
17	Thanks Sarah Hilton for the crockery  -  think you have  @ mikeyrayment down to a T !  
17	Excellent  @ guardian article about the good work of  @ TurningPointUKs peer mentors .  Gold standard ,  however ,  would be qualified nursing staff . 
17	Extremely unhelpful / misleading of  @ BBCr4today  @ BBCBreaking to repeat incorrect statements re :  antidepressant addiction  ( ‚â† tranquillisers ) 
17	Finally ,   @ BBCFileon4 ,  not accurate description of physical / psychological harms of meth from your speaker  -  more than just ageing and candy ! 
17	 @ Danielf90 Strangely though ,  often it does .  In psychiatry ,  for instance . 
17	 @ mattyheron i do lots of work in ICU  -  delirium rife and many pts not unconscious .  .  . 
17	 @ zebsoanes You foraged cinnamon ?  Bravo sir !
