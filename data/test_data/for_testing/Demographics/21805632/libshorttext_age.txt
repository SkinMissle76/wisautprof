-0.42	 .  .  .  and now the National Rail website has slowed to a crawl .  I wonder why that might be ? 
-0.42	Oi !  What have you done with the bloody trains ,  Jude ?  ! 
-0.42	People who claim they are a little bit OCD should read this ,  then shut the fuck up .   # OCD
-0.42	Aah ,  stuff it .  Ill get the next train today . 
-0.42	 @ claz0r You have friends !  If you want to do stuff ,  just let us know .  I for one am almost always game for doing next to nothing together . 
-0.42	 @ claz0r Aah ,  yes .  In which case ,  I merely totally agree with you . 
-0.42	 @ claz0r Or just leave it off .  90 %  of the time ,  it is utterly irrelevant whether the person is male or female . 
-0.42	Its all gone wrong . 
-0.42	 @ retallicka Crikey !  When are you going ,  then ?

-0.42	 @ PennyRed  @ BBCr4today Well said ,  maam .  You articulated my perspective wonderfully .  Thank you . 
-0.42	Of course ,  for the irony to properly function there ,  a )  I would have to be a celebrity ,  and b )  lots of people would have to retweet it . 
-0.42	I find it astonishing the way people will retweet any old bollocks just because a celebrity said it . 
-0.42	 @ AlecIJohnson how did you know ? 
-0.42	 .  .  .  and a quick google search tells me that this crap has happened before .  Twice in the last 3 years ,  in fact . 
-0.42	So ,  trains from Bracknell were fucked due to leaves on the line .  Which were still attached to a tree .  Which had fallen and hit a train . 
-0.42	Fuck me ,  Im hot !   # fnaar

-0.42	 @ Feathery _ Wings  @ Timato _  You got that one wrong ,  Timmy .  Been too many years since GCSE French for you .  Or was it O - level ?   ;  ) 
-0.42	 @ BrotherMunro Baah !  Dawn of War was awesome .  Shadow of the Horned Rat was crap in comparison .  Us Fantasy players have been shortchanged .   : P

-0.42	 @ just _ immi Youd think ,  but if it doesnt work ,  thats the easiest way to fix it .  Worth checking ,  at least . 
-0.42	Thank Maynard for the complex polyrythmns of Tool .  Impossible to doze off when theres 17 / 16 music in your ears .
