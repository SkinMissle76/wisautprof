2	 @ MissUkulady I see .  Dont let yourself get pressured into doing things you wont enjoy ,  is all . 
2	 @ MissUkulady Screw obligations .  Do what you want to do ! 
2	 @ MissUkulady Have you asked  @ VectorJon if you can come to his ? 
2	 @ lyn _  _ sea is a saint .  That is all . 
2	 @ Timato _  Try 12 : 50 ! 
2	 .  .  .  and now the National Rail website has slowed to a crawl .  I wonder why that might be ? 
2	Oi !  What have you done with the bloody trains ,  Jude ?  ! 
2	People who claim they are a little bit OCD should read this ,  then shut the fuck up .   # OCD
2	Aah ,  stuff it .  Ill get the next train today . 
2	 @ claz0r You have friends !  If you want to do stuff ,  just let us know .  I for one am almost always game for doing next to nothing together . 
2	 @ claz0r Aah ,  yes .  In which case ,  I merely totally agree with you . 
2	 @ claz0r Or just leave it off .  90 %  of the time ,  it is utterly irrelevant whether the person is male or female . 
2	Its all gone wrong . 
2	 @ retallicka Crikey !  When are you going ,  then ? 
2	 @ BrotherMunro Yo ,  Chris !  Ive made it to the castle ,  but I cant find anyone here .

2	 @ Timato _  Do you mean plough ?   # NotAmerican
2	 @ PennyRed  @ BBCr4today Well said ,  maam .  You articulated my perspective wonderfully .  Thank you . 
2	Of course ,  for the irony to properly function there ,  a )  I would have to be a celebrity ,  and b )  lots of people would have to retweet it . 
2	I find it astonishing the way people will retweet any old bollocks just because a celebrity said it . 
2	 @ AlecIJohnson how did you know ? 
2	 .  .  .  and a quick google search tells me that this crap has happened before .  Twice in the last 3 years ,  in fact . 
2	So ,  trains from Bracknell were fucked due to leaves on the line .  Which were still attached to a tree .  Which had fallen and hit a train . 
2	Fuck me ,  Im hot !   # fnaar
2	 @ ChrisGPackham Youve got something on your face .

2	 @ gemgemloulou Easy :  bikini underneath owls jumper . 
2	 @ gemgemloulou Crikey !  Go for it !  Also ,  check the contract as to who has control of the pics and what they can do with them . 
2	 @ Timato _  Ive always wondered that .  Weird ,  eh ? 
2	 @ Timato _  Dont know why .  Theyre probably closer to your age than she is . 
2	 @ claz0r You running the length of the A3 ? 
2	Old Stoneface with the rock hard pecs !  RT  @ LisaRoseStead How buff was Buster Keaton ?  ?  
2	 @ Timato _  Yo !  My phone just died ,  so its off and on charge .  Gonna have some food then head quizwards after that .  Might be a bit late . 
2	Have some passive - aggressive hint - dropping :  
2	 @ peachesanscream Be cautious :  Whenever you get into it and fit ,  the hem will disappear . 
2	 @ just _ immi Thats a chance youll have to take . 
2	 @ just _ immi Go into the shop tomorrow ,  leave it on the shelves . 
2	Almost uncanny how much this sounds like the real thing :  
2	 @ gemgemloulou Brava ! 
2	 @ Alyonkaa Rightyho ,  Ill let you know next time something is happening . 
2	 @ Alyonkaa Actually ,  theres a plan in the pipeline for this Sunday afternoon .  Will have to get back to you .  Same phone number ? 
2	Good grief !  I tweet about a flat in Wandsworth ,  and i immediately get followed by a Wandsworth estate agent .   # DamnBots
2	 @ Alyonkaa Not just Game of Thrones ,  either ;  theres all kinds of stuff we play .  Great fun .  Battlestar Galactica is particularly good  :  ) 
2	 @ Alyonkaa About once a month ,  on average ,  at  @ JonathanPWaldens flat in Wandsworth ,  or  @ alphatraces house in Tooting . 
2	 @ Alyonkaa Ooh !  Ive played that one a few times with some of my friends .  Its rather good .  Fancy joining us ?  Havent seen you for aaaages ! 
2	 @ Feathery _ Wings  @ Timato _  You got that one wrong ,  Timmy .  Been too many years since GCSE French for you .  Or was it O - level ?   ;  ) 
2	 @ BrotherMunro Baah !  Dawn of War was awesome .  Shadow of the Horned Rat was crap in comparison .  Us Fantasy players have been shortchanged .   : P
2	I fucking love buttered toast .   # ExpensiveTastes
2	 @ BrotherMunro Umm ,  I think Warhammer :  Total War is already in the pipeline .   : D
2	 @ GiniJG Oh ,  hai !   : D

2	Oh ,  hello !  Ludicrously pretty toy shop girl is back .   * wibble * 
2	 @ gemgemloulou Probably because they thought you looked amazing . 
2	Made it home OK ,  for those who care .   * sleeps * 
2	 @ just _ immi Probably also worth checking there isnt a sticker over the lens .  .  . 
2	 @ just _ immi Youd think ,  but if it doesnt work ,  thats the easiest way to fix it .  Worth checking ,  at least . 
2	Thank Maynard for the complex polyrythmns of Tool .  Impossible to doze off when theres 17 / 16 music in your ears . 
2	Soooo tiiiiiired .  Must .  .  .  Not .  .  .  Sleep .  .  .

2	I am a huge fan of smoking ,  smoking makes things better :  smoked ham ,  smoked salmon ,  smoked cheddar .  .  . 
2	 @ Heresy _ Corner English law requires reasonable belief as to consent .  Even if an animal can consent ,  can a zoophile have such a belief ? 
2	 @ AlecIJohnson Lots and lots .

2	Seriously ,  HOW DID I GET HOME ? 
2	 @ leestuartevans  @ claz0r Quite drunk Chris is VERY sensible .  Very drunk Chris managed to make it home ,  too .  Sober ( ish )  Chris has NO idea how .

2	Memo to self :  next time you are wallowing in self - pity ,  watch an episode of Bottom .  Things can always be worse . 
2	 @ Aiannucci To jump the shark ,  doesnt it have to have been good in the first place ? 
2	 @ DavidAllenGreen Are you familiar with AP Herberts Misleading Cases ?  He wrote one thats uncannily similar to Trenton Oldfield . 
2	 @ bengoldacre Have you seen the new blog from Edzard Ernst about his research into complementary medicine ?
