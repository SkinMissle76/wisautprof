-1	 @ lyn _  _ sea is a saint .  That is all . 
-1	 @ Timato _  Try 12 : 50 ! 
-1	 .  .  .  and now the National Rail website has slowed to a crawl .  I wonder why that might be ? 
-1	Oi !  What have you done with the bloody trains ,  Jude ?  ! 
-1	People who claim they are a little bit OCD should read this ,  then shut the fuck up .   # OCD
-1	Aah ,  stuff it .  Ill get the next train today . 
-1	 @ claz0r You have friends !  If you want to do stuff ,  just let us know .  I for one am almost always game for doing next to nothing together . 
-1	 @ claz0r Aah ,  yes .  In which case ,  I merely totally agree with you . 
-1	 @ claz0r Or just leave it off .  90 %  of the time ,  it is utterly irrelevant whether the person is male or female . 
-1	Its all gone wrong . 
-1	 @ retallicka Crikey !  When are you going ,  then ? 
-1	 @ BrotherMunro Yo ,  Chris !  Ive made it to the castle ,  but I cant find anyone here .

-1	 @ PennyRed  @ BBCr4today Well said ,  maam .  You articulated my perspective wonderfully .  Thank you . 
-1	Of course ,  for the irony to properly function there ,  a )  I would have to be a celebrity ,  and b )  lots of people would have to retweet it . 
-1	I find it astonishing the way people will retweet any old bollocks just because a celebrity said it . 
-1	 @ AlecIJohnson how did you know ? 
-1	 .  .  .  and a quick google search tells me that this crap has happened before .  Twice in the last 3 years ,  in fact . 
-1	So ,  trains from Bracknell were fucked due to leaves on the line .  Which were still attached to a tree .  Which had fallen and hit a train . 
-1	Fuck me ,  Im hot !   # fnaar

-1	Have some passive - aggressive hint - dropping :  
-1	 @ peachesanscream Be cautious :  Whenever you get into it and fit ,  the hem will disappear . 
-1	 @ just _ immi Thats a chance youll have to take . 
-1	 @ just _ immi Go into the shop tomorrow ,  leave it on the shelves . 
-1	Almost uncanny how much this sounds like the real thing :  
-1	 @ gemgemloulou Brava !

-1	 @ Alyonkaa Actually ,  theres a plan in the pipeline for this Sunday afternoon .  Will have to get back to you .  Same phone number ? 
-1	Good grief !  I tweet about a flat in Wandsworth ,  and i immediately get followed by a Wandsworth estate agent .   # DamnBots
-1	 @ Alyonkaa Not just Game of Thrones ,  either ;  theres all kinds of stuff we play .  Great fun .  Battlestar Galactica is particularly good  :  )

-1	 @ BrotherMunro Baah !  Dawn of War was awesome .  Shadow of the Horned Rat was crap in comparison .  Us Fantasy players have been shortchanged .   : P
-1	I fucking love buttered toast .   # ExpensiveTastes
-1	 @ BrotherMunro Umm ,  I think Warhammer :  Total War is already in the pipeline .   : D

-1	 @ just _ immi Probably also worth checking there isnt a sticker over the lens .  .  . 
-1	 @ just _ immi Youd think ,  but if it doesnt work ,  thats the easiest way to fix it .  Worth checking ,  at least . 
-1	Thank Maynard for the complex polyrythmns of Tool .  Impossible to doze off when theres 17 / 16 music in your ears .
