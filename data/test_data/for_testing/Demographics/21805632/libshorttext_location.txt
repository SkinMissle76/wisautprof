40	 @ MissUkulady I see .  Dont let yourself get pressured into doing things you wont enjoy ,  is all . 
40	 @ MissUkulady Screw obligations .  Do what you want to do ! 
40	 @ MissUkulady Have you asked  @ VectorJon if you can come to his ? 
40	 @ lyn _  _ sea is a saint .  That is all . 
40	 @ Timato _  Try 12 : 50 ! 
40	 .  .  .  and now the National Rail website has slowed to a crawl .  I wonder why that might be ? 
40	Oi !  What have you done with the bloody trains ,  Jude ?  ! 
40	People who claim they are a little bit OCD should read this ,  then shut the fuck up .   # OCD
40	Aah ,  stuff it .  Ill get the next train today . 
40	 @ claz0r You have friends !  If you want to do stuff ,  just let us know .  I for one am almost always game for doing next to nothing together . 
40	 @ claz0r Aah ,  yes .  In which case ,  I merely totally agree with you . 
40	 @ claz0r Or just leave it off .  90 %  of the time ,  it is utterly irrelevant whether the person is male or female . 
40	Its all gone wrong . 
40	 @ retallicka Crikey !  When are you going ,  then ? 
40	 @ BrotherMunro Yo ,  Chris !  Ive made it to the castle ,  but I cant find anyone here . 
40	 @ peachesanscream I knew that 62 "  girl I knew at uni was engaged to a closeted gay guy all along ! 
40	 @ Timato _  Do you mean plough ?   # NotAmerican
40	 @ PennyRed  @ BBCr4today Well said ,  maam .  You articulated my perspective wonderfully .  Thank you . 
40	Of course ,  for the irony to properly function there ,  a )  I would have to be a celebrity ,  and b )  lots of people would have to retweet it . 
40	I find it astonishing the way people will retweet any old bollocks just because a celebrity said it . 
40	 @ AlecIJohnson how did you know ? 
40	 .  .  .  and a quick google search tells me that this crap has happened before .  Twice in the last 3 years ,  in fact . 
40	So ,  trains from Bracknell were fucked due to leaves on the line .  Which were still attached to a tree .  Which had fallen and hit a train . 
40	Fuck me ,  Im hot !   # fnaar
40	 @ ChrisGPackham Youve got something on your face . 
40	 @ jembloomfield  Have you moved institutions ,  then ? 
40	 @ Feathery _ Wings  @ Timato _  Hes a wonderful idiot .   : P
40	 @ Alyonkaa Dont watch TV ,  silly .  Play computer games !  Read books !  Draw things ,  write things ,  make things ! 
40	 @ claz0r  @ gemgemloulou Fashion maestro ,  me .  Not at all do i just throw clothes on randomly every morning . 
40	 @ gemgemloulou Easy :  bikini underneath owls jumper . 
40	 @ gemgemloulou Crikey !  Go for it !  Also ,  check the contract as to who has control of the pics and what they can do with them . 
40	 @ Timato _  Ive always wondered that .  Weird ,  eh ? 
40	 @ Timato _  Dont know why .  Theyre probably closer to your age than she is . 
40	 @ claz0r You running the length of the A3 ? 
40	Old Stoneface with the rock hard pecs !  RT  @ LisaRoseStead How buff was Buster Keaton ?  ?  
40	 @ Timato _  Yo !  My phone just died ,  so its off and on charge .  Gonna have some food then head quizwards after that .  Might be a bit late . 
40	Have some passive - aggressive hint - dropping :  
40	 @ peachesanscream Be cautious :  Whenever you get into it and fit ,  the hem will disappear . 
40	 @ just _ immi Thats a chance youll have to take . 
40	 @ just _ immi Go into the shop tomorrow ,  leave it on the shelves . 
40	Almost uncanny how much this sounds like the real thing :  
40	 @ gemgemloulou Brava ! 
40	 @ Alyonkaa Rightyho ,  Ill let you know next time something is happening . 
40	 @ Alyonkaa Actually ,  theres a plan in the pipeline for this Sunday afternoon .  Will have to get back to you .  Same phone number ? 
40	Good grief !  I tweet about a flat in Wandsworth ,  and i immediately get followed by a Wandsworth estate agent .   # DamnBots
40	 @ Alyonkaa Not just Game of Thrones ,  either ;  theres all kinds of stuff we play .  Great fun .  Battlestar Galactica is particularly good  :  ) 
40	 @ Alyonkaa About once a month ,  on average ,  at  @ JonathanPWaldens flat in Wandsworth ,  or  @ alphatraces house in Tooting . 
40	 @ Alyonkaa Ooh !  Ive played that one a few times with some of my friends .  Its rather good .  Fancy joining us ?  Havent seen you for aaaages ! 
40	 @ Feathery _ Wings  @ Timato _  You got that one wrong ,  Timmy .  Been too many years since GCSE French for you .  Or was it O - level ?   ;  ) 
40	 @ BrotherMunro Baah !  Dawn of War was awesome .  Shadow of the Horned Rat was crap in comparison .  Us Fantasy players have been shortchanged .   : P
40	I fucking love buttered toast .   # ExpensiveTastes
40	 @ BrotherMunro Umm ,  I think Warhammer :  Total War is already in the pipeline .   : D
40	 @ GiniJG Oh ,  hai !   : D
40	 @ Feathery _ Wings Oh ,  hai ! 
40	 @ peachesanscream Well then ,  this is the tumblr for you !   ( VERY NSFW !  )

40	 @ TeenyBella Sue em . 
40	Today is a bad day to have shitty skin . 
40	Oh ,  hello !  Ludicrously pretty toy shop girl is back .   * wibble * 
40	 @ gemgemloulou Probably because they thought you looked amazing . 
40	Made it home OK ,  for those who care .   * sleeps * 
40	 @ just _ immi Probably also worth checking there isnt a sticker over the lens .  .  . 
40	 @ just _ immi Youd think ,  but if it doesnt work ,  thats the easiest way to fix it .  Worth checking ,  at least . 
40	Thank Maynard for the complex polyrythmns of Tool .  Impossible to doze off when theres 17 / 16 music in your ears . 
40	Soooo tiiiiiired .  Must .  .  .  Not .  .  .  Sleep .  .  . 
40	 @ just _ immi Tried updating the drivers ? 
40	 @ claz0r  @ WaverleyBC But if they grit them ,  where will Godalming residents do their luge practice ?

40	It is not the business of the press to expose criminals .  That is what the courts are for .   # leveson
40	 "  @ PeteBrissenden :   @ gemgemloulou Yep ,  along with my all time favourite :  Lawrence Of A Labia "  Ironic ,  as the real man was gay . 
40	I am a huge fan of smoking ,  smoking makes things better :  smoked ham ,  smoked salmon ,  smoked cheddar .  .  . 
40	 @ Heresy _ Corner English law requires reasonable belief as to consent .  Even if an animal can consent ,  can a zoophile have such a belief ? 
40	 @ AlecIJohnson Lots and lots . 
40	 @ russss  @ londonhackspace As you do . 
40	Seriously ,  HOW DID I GET HOME ? 
40	 @ leestuartevans  @ claz0r Quite drunk Chris is VERY sensible .  Very drunk Chris managed to make it home ,  too .  Sober ( ish )  Chris has NO idea how . 
40	 @ claz0r  @ leestuartevans Its OK ,  i made the same mistake !   # BunglersInCrime
40	 @ bengoldacre Whats wrong with hectolitres ?  Dont you speak ancient Greek ? 
40	 @ Pseudorandom71 Ive finished .  Managed not to lose a dodgy rook ending .  Everyone is done now ,  match drawn . 
40	Memo to self :  next time you are wallowing in self - pity ,  watch an episode of Bottom .  Things can always be worse . 
40	 @ Aiannucci To jump the shark ,  doesnt it have to have been good in the first place ? 
40	 @ DavidAllenGreen Are you familiar with AP Herberts Misleading Cases ?  He wrote one thats uncannily similar to Trenton Oldfield . 
40	 @ bengoldacre Have you seen the new blog from Edzard Ernst about his research into complementary medicine ?

40	No ,  wait .  I think theyre playing a fucking coldplay song !  FFS !   # closingceremony
40	Oh ,  listen !  Real music !   # closingceremony

40	I thought for one hopeful moment that Coldplay had finished .  Hope dashed .   # closingceremony
40	Why are  @ gentlemanrhymer and  @ prof _ elemental not performing ?   # closingceremony

40	 @ godalmingad disappointed that there are apparently no squash courts . 
40	Dammit ,  Mary Beard !  Youre making my TV show !  But without the sexy young presenters !  FOOL !  
40	 @ Susanna _ Forrest Any legal library will have them .  An awful lot of it is still good law . 
40	You might like these ;  macro photographs of the insides of musical instruments :  
40	 @ AlecIJohnson Oh ,  sod .  Should have checked for that sort of thing .  Dont log in to Twitter often enough ,  clearly .

40	 @ leestuartevans Thats not Genevieve !  This is Genevieve !  
40	 @ TeenyBella Yes .  
40	I wouldnt have thought that costume was physically possible !  RT  @ G33KPRON Venture Bros Cosplay :  Molotov Cocktease 
40	 @ jembloomfield That makes me think of a bog ,  sooty ,  Wales - sized boot stamping on the Earth . 
40	Today has made me feel decidedly mediocre ,  so tomorrow i shall try extra hard to be awesome .

40	You speak the truth .  Omnomnomnom .  .  .  RT  @ Timato _  Brie bacon and cranberry panini .  So so good
40	 @ sheepfilms Youve been retweeted by  @ cyriakharris .  Watch out ,  your kitty is probably just about to turn into something terrifying .  .  . 
40	 @ ProfBrianCox  @ davidallengreen If you genuinely believe youve been cursed ,  its common assault .  Otherwise ,  no :  no actus reus .
