3	 @ O2 yes Sony supply it but as locked to you ,  you need to request it .  Hold o2 responsible as you locked it without permission
3	 @ O2 Yes now locked to O2  , requested the code via you but now been told that as the phone was not supplied by you you cannot supply it
3	 @ Moucho _ Blasto fine Just been to watch the new Harry Potter movie
