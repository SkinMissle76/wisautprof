41	 @ DaveGorman Excellent good to know the internet has some consistancy
41	 @ DaveGorman you realise you are one of the few things ever that breaks rule 34 of the internet
41	 @ O2 yes Sony supply it but as locked to you ,  you need to request it .  Hold o2 responsible as you locked it without permission
41	 @ O2 Yes now locked to O2  , requested the code via you but now been told that as the phone was not supplied by you you cannot supply it
41	 @ Moucho _ Blasto fine Just been to watch the new Harry Potter movie
41	 @ O2 I got it from a catalogue as a sim free phone and it worked ok .   It was sent off through one of your stores about 4 months ago
41	 @ ValeWolf My wife and I were welling up too
41	 @ HarryPotterFilm  -  Going to the Newcastle Screening so will only see the red carpet onscreen ,  but looking forward to the film
41	 @ O2 yes it was fine before .  You flashed the phone with you software when you returned it .  Looks like it contained the lock
41	Just got back in from new Harry Potter Movie ,  It was Really good ,  especially the end .  # DeathlyHallows
41	Do you think my wife will admit Im right now ?   I have  @ DerrenBrown ,  the BBC and mathematics on my side :  
41	Off to see the new Harry Potter movie tonight .   Got myself good husband points for that . 
41	 @ DerrenBrown thank you for the show last night .  Just so you know my wife is terrified of you . 
41	 @ TeamIntergen hope everything was OK when you got to the office this morning
41	 @ O2 Why would the unlocked Sony I sent for a new screen now need a code from Sony  ( in up to 7 days )  before I can use it with my new Provider

41	 @ O2 are we having trouble with the website ?  " Even the My o2 app cant sign in . 
41	 @ O2 I spoke to Sony who confirmed that flashing it caused the lock and only you can unlock it

41	 @ O2 Do you not supply it ?  Do you have a way of contacting sony directly ?
