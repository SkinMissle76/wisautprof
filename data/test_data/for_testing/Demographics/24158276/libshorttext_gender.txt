-1	 @ dave1010 It also means it is the 5th anniversary of when I should have bought a load of them  ;  ) 
-1	 @ davewalker They should be in the Gmail account of the Google account you used on Android .  Cant Windows phone get them from Gmail ? 
-1	 @ MoneySavingExp Not really .  The statutory paternity pay wouldnt even cover my mortgage ! 
-1	 @ spolsky Their code structure is broken .  What if I want meat but I dont want all those other things ?   :  ) 
-1	 @ charlie _ whiting Yeah ,  I forgot about the cost - per - point .  Sauber could go bankrupt if they win the last race ! 
-1	 @ Christianitymag So Abraham ruled his little tribe ,  and then suddenly the Egyptians were in charge .  How did that happen ? 
-1	 @ jonfildes  @ BBC _ Future Im hoping for a future where BBC considers UK to be part of the world and can therefore view BBC worldwide stuff ! 
-1	Not that anyone who is likely to give such prizes away is following me or would likely care what I think  ;  ) 
-1	 @ suziperry  @ ideal _ home _ show The dress doesnt seem to match the scenery !   :  ) 
-1	Dear Twitter users .  Having a prize for the xth follower just means no - one will follow you until you get to x - 1 ,  which youll never reach .  . 
-1	Does anyone actually watch the whole of a 2 minute YouTube advert without skipping after 5 seconds ?  How long before we lose the skip option ? 
-1	£9 . 99  @ Argos _ Online order paid with a £10 voucher somehow cost me another 1p .  Suspect with card fees itll cost Argos more .  Why Argos ,  why ? 
-1	 @ GeorgeTakei I thought we agreed I would be the one wearing grey to this party ,  now Ive got to warp home and get changed  * sigh * 
-1	 @ McLarenF1  @ JensonButton  @ SChecoPerez Me me me !  Although Im not in Brazil so might find it difficult to collect  :  (   # BelieveInMcLaren
-1	 @ revkatebottley  @ davewalker Yeah I already made mistake of looking there .  Mistake in that it took a long time to drag myself away .  .  .   :  ) 
-1	 @ Christianitymag I was also disappointed that Ishmael didnt sing any Glorie songs
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Precaution if Kimi cant be bothered to turn up for a race  ;  ) 
-1	 @ weareworship Also your Mission Worship downloads page only has one song on it .  Shouldnt there be 16 ? 
-1	 @ AuntBessies Gravy obviously .  Although topping with jam is good for a dessert if there are leftovers  :  ) 
-1	 @ cmcclarney Thank you for the great worship on Friday night and this morning .   :  ) 
-1	 @ LeeMcKenzieF1 Im already looking forward to  @ therealdcf1s next instalment of Vettel  & amp ;  McKenzie rumours  ;  ) 
-1	 @ charlie _ whiting Youd also need to find a way for Vettel to remember his original number should he ever give up being World Champion
-1	Had a very nice gluten - free breakfast at  @ TheCoffeeHouse5 with the  @ ccmh men this morning  :  ) 
-1	 @ tfaiso I tried it at  " Original "  .  My poor old Windows laptop laughed at me and just gave me stuttery playback !  Looked great at 1080p tho  :  ) 
-1	 @ MoneySavingExp 3 different energy comparison sites ,  3 different results !  Argghh !  I need a comparison of comparison sites !  !   :  ) 
-1	When given a choice of secure WiFi with a saved password or an open network ,  why does Android often go for the latter ? 
-1	Dear  @ apress ,  Im afraid your  $ 12 ebooks offer doesnt quite match up to  @ packtpub  $ 5 offering ! 
-1	8 yr olds  @ clarksshoes worn out before he outgrew them .  Seems no point paying extra for Clarks then ,  will go to  @ Sainsburys for next pair
-1	Headline  " Professor Green arrested in London "  .  Was it for the murder of his brother the Priest ,  in the Library with the lead pipe ? 
-1	 @ danshapiro Im trying to decide whether to get a only - a - small - delay little backup Christmas pressie or a long - delay big backup pressie :  ) 
-1	 @ tim _ weber Be careful what you ask ,   @ Scobleizer might start posting more pics of himself in the shower
-1	 @ tfaiso Mental note ,  find generous rich dude to stalk ,  erm ,  retweet  ;  )  If everyone were as generous as you ,  world would be a better place !  :  ) 
-1	 @ vickybeeching Consider it an opportunity .  Perhaps your next album  could be a dance CD  ;  -  ) 
-1	 @ tfaiso If I did that with my mrs ,  Id get the drink soon enough .  .  .  poured all over me !   :  ) 
-1	 @ WilliamsF1Team Aww ,  no PC version  :  (  Could you give me an XBox or PS3 to go with it should I win ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ danshapiro Thanks ,  honest is good  :  ) 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary £19 . 98 is the  / sale /  price of a t - shirt ?  !  Does it light up if they win or something ? 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Its not for the trophies or the prize money ,  RBRs motivation is the AutoSport awards !  SV really wants to be a standup comic
-1	 @ dnaltews  @ inetpro Remember .  Youre the product ,  the advertiser is the customer . 
-1	 @ tfaiso I would choose the Nexus 5 ,  but I didnt see one in the photo !   ;  ) 
-1	 @ davewalker Our church has a toaster somewhere that was used for a Mens Breakfast once .  Its unlikely to be in the kitchen though
-1	 @ timebenezer Perhaps it is International Get Some Work Done day  ;  ) 
-1	 @ achrisevans Perhaps they can afford to let us have 280 character tweets now  ;  ) 
-1	 @ MSE _ GuyAnker  @ MoneySavingExp From Jan ?  So does this mean all the firms are likely to increase their prices in Dec to pre - empt it ? 
-1	 @ McGuireDavid Of course it can sometimes lead to finding 50 forums with the question ,  and none of them with a useful reply ! 
-1	 @ robwalling  @ danshapiro Your copy ?  Even if secretly it is for you ,  arent we meant to be pretending its for the kids ?   ;  ) 
-1	RT  @ suffolkcc The clocks change this evening .  Remember to  # TickTockTest your smoke alarms too !   /  /  Suffolk .  Only 3 days behind the rest of UK
-1	 @ ScarbsF1 No doubt RBR have a way of squeezing 9 different models in windtunnel at a time  & amp ;  CFD software that only uses a couple of flops .  .  . 
-1	 @ JennieGow  @ BBC5LiveF1 Christian Horners foot ? 
-1	Strange noise coming from building next door .  Sounds like one of Amazons drones has got trapped and is struggling to find an exit .  .  . 
-1	 @ inetpro  @ dnaltews 190million unique twitter users each month .  Even if 10 %  marked adverts as spam ,  still 170 million left .  Hardly a dent  :  ( 
-1	 @ violetposy An iPod / iPhone is the obvious answer .  Then you wont have the same problem next year  ;  -  ) 
-1	Well I guess it is official ,   @ dungerman has declared me  @ ccmh s  " boffin "  .  .  . 
-1	 @ suffolkcc Havent you noticed that you arrived at work an hour before everyone else the last couple of days ? 
-1	Im now hoping every Church in Suffolk will try  @ openlp  .  .  well at those who are awake at 6 : 40am listening to  @ dungerman  ;  ) 
-1	 @ TMDWP Thanks ,  I think my evening is just about to disappear under a load of HISHEdotcom videos !   :  ) 
-1	 @ twurchofengland If only someone had told the poor child that he only needed to write this bit :  amazon  . com / gp / product / B0032HF60M  :  ) 
-1	Show the world we want a phone worth keeping !   # phonebloks 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary  @ Lotus _ F1Team Instead of Kimi ,  Eric might need it if Heikki finishes out the points so he can quickly escape from Davide .  .  ;  ) 
-1	 @ Canonjjohn Also blackmail aspect ?  Give me a treat or Ill do harm .  .  .  not a particularly good example for kids
-1	 @ McGuireDavid I often use questions ,  accuracy of results is often improved  ( since someone else has likely posted same question somewhere ) 
-1	 @ MSE _ GuyAnker  @ MoneySavingExp To clarify ,  I mean increase prices for those of us mid - contract  ( rather than new contracts ) 
-1	 @ timebenezer I said in the  ( very brief )  interview it was  " about 10 years old "  .  .  .  lucky guess !   :  ) 
-1	 @ weareworship I wanted to mention that you really need an  " Other "  in your signup Denomination list !  Were a Local Ecumenical Project church . 
-1	 @ virginmedia Seriously ?  If you hold your passwords in plain text anywhere it is not secure ,  no matter what .  Glad Im not a Virgin customer ! 
-1	 @ codinghorror I think you need to come down to the real world at some point .  Not everyone has spare cash to throw at latest tech ! 
-1	 @ McGuireDavid Indeed .  They should be using tracking cookies then theyd know exactly which you want to watch .  .  . 
-1	 @ ArgosHelpers I really do hope you have a project going on to drag your 19th century systems into the 21st century ! 
-1	 @ BTCare £900mil for a few games of football ?  I was hoping the increase in line rental etc would be going towards infrastructure  * sigh * 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Perhaps Maldonado is the only one who has a pen ? 
-1	 @ thechurchmouse Who copied who ? 
-1	 @ NobleF1 Is there / will there be a video of his speech online ? 
-1	 @ oneplusi Perhaps you should choose the sportscar with the most photogenic seat fabric .  .  . 
-1	 @ BTCare You appear to be talking to yourself ,  but good attempt at pretending  @ BTSport and  @ BTCare are different accounts  ;  ) 
-1	 @ timebenezer Are you sure it isnt a problem your end ?   :  ) 
-1	 @ GeorgeTakei Before deciding to resurrect Professor X ,  Sir Patrick was asked to audition as Lobsterine in the next X - Men film
-1	 @ McGuireDavid  * reads the Aung San Suu Kyi Wikipedia page *  Cant see anything about copywriting or marathon running .  .  . 
-1	 @ ruskin147 Perhaps you could search for facebook beheading videos on the Surface and kill two birds with one ,  erm ,  guillotine
-1	 @ andrewbensonf1 I suspect Bernie could do RBR a few favours to get him out of the contract though !   ( Not that they need any atm ) 
-1	 @ Jamesallenonf1 I know it wont be fair whoever does it ,  but surely bottom 3 teams would be better than top ?  Close gap ,  not make it bigger ! 
-1	 @ violetposy Plus tiny garden ,  enough parking for one small car and who needs space for wardrobes anyway ? 
-1	 @ dave1010 Well RAM is cheap ,  and anyway everyone knows Google isnt evil .  .   * cough *   ;  ) 
-1	 @ tfaiso Did it get in a fight with the Nexus 5 ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ tfaiso Im going to deliberately watch it at 320x240 out of pure envy  ;  -  ) 
-1	 @ timebenezer itll just often connect to BTWifi  ( which then requires a browser login )  rather than my personal BT WiFi  * sigh * 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Perhaps they were able to borrow a turbo F1 car from the 80s  ;  ) 
-1	 " reduce CO2 emissions by 18 . 4 %  per employee "   /  /  Did  @ McLarenF1 take baked beans off the menu ?   ;  )  
-1	 @ cyclinglawman  @ buryfree Yeah ,  I find it odd .  Im guessing a few councillors are very friendly with a CEO of a bridge building company .  . 
-1	 @ weareworship Your website feedback option doesnt appear to be working
-1	 @ andrewbensonf1 Perhaps they ought to also have a speed limit of 70mph ,  and keep to the left unless overtaking ? 
-1	 @ LouFellingham Fantastic Worship tonight at  @ MissionWorship ,  Thank you  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ McLarenF1 Those simulated tyres must be much better than the real ones to be able to 6 . 5million laps  ;  ) 
-1	 @ worshipcentral  # missionworship Drummer was great .  Shame about the sound engineer who set volume of the kick drum .  Made us ill .   :  -  ( 
-1	 @ inetpro Accept that a service such as twitter needs income ,  and advertising is currently the most viable solution
-1	 @ davelee So why do new gadgets get prominent BBC news coverage ,  where new cars  ( for example )  get relegated to Top Gear ? 
-1	 @ adds68 1080p is so yesterday .   @ tfaiso will now have to wait for the 2160p PS5 so it looks good on his new TV  ;  ) 
-1	 @ mattfarina You should use Windows ,  the upgrade to 8 . 1 went smoothly for everyo .  .  .  oh wait .   ;  ) 
-1	 @ iamspecialized Not nice of you to force Cafe Roubaix bike shop to change name .  He isnt going to court so be nice ,  pay his renaming costs . 
-1	Looking forward to  @ MartinSmithTV at  @ MissionWorship .  Hope the kick drum volume isnt quite so loud as  @ timhughes77 s that made us ill  :  -  ( 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Sky Sources ,  who have just read the BBC website ,  understand that .  .  . 
-1	Really  @ Argos _ Online  ,  too high volume website errors 3 weeks before Christmas ?  Why not just handover your store keys to  @ AmazonUK too ? 
-1	 @ danshapiro On a scale of 1 - 10  ( where 1 = no chance ,  and 10 = Amazon drones on route now )  how confident are you of UK delivery by Christmas ? 
-1	 @ davewalker  @ missnfranchised Or the Churchwarden pigeon hole
-1	Dear Quantum Motorsports ,  please give Lotus your money so they can sign a driver rather than a wallet 
-1	 @ tfaiso Yay ,  a review of something I can afford  :  )  Im looking forward to that one ! 
-1	 @ martinsaunders Reminds me of this 
-1	 @ stedsbc Not so short on the way back though carrying lots of heavy shopping bags with kids screaming at your heels !   :  ) 
-1	 @ inetpro Ahh ,  I misunderstood  :  ) 
-1	 @ JensonButton Just cut a few corners .  You might want to paint the car red and steal a Spaniards helmet first though to get away with it  ;  ) 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Hes getting married ? 
-1	 @ McGuireDavid  :  -  )   ( oh and apologies for the dodgy apostrophe  * embarrassed *  ) 
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary So  @ LewisHamilton can cope with two girls singing in the back ,  but not if his race engineer tells him his tyres are hot ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ ProfBrianCox Umm why deny it ?  Who is it hurting ?  Would the world be a better place with inaccurate GPS or something ? 
-1	 @ tfaiso Ill take your word for it ,  Ive never married a blow up doll so cant compare  :  ) 
-1	 @ shipoffoolscom 
-1	 @ clarksshoes I doubt we have a receipt any more sadly
-1	 @ MissionWorship Well at least you got the web address right in the tweet  :  ) 
-1	 @ McLarenF1  # AskKevin If McLaren have best car  & amp ;  if it turns out you are faster than  @ JensonButton ,  could you let him win the British GP ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ shipoffoolscom Surprised you havent commented on the major news story of today .  Some churches are daring to use projectors ,  not hymnbooks ! 
-1	 @ davewalker  @ missnfranchised For some reason they mysteriously find their way to the PA / Projection desk in our church
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary Ouch .  Thats gotta hurt
-1	 @ guardian  @ tjathurman Nothing like a bit of atheist infighting .  Perhaps they ought to consider splitting into different denominations .  .  . 
-1	 @ ScarbsF1 Perhaps they are trying to attempt to lap the rest of the field before the season ends ! 
-1	 @ curryspcworld Aww ,  I just recently cleared out all my old  /  broken tech ! 
-1	 @ tfaiso I always suggest folk buy a device for what it has ,  not what it may or may not have in future ,  regardless of promises . 
-1	Dear Website .  If someone hasnt visited your site before ,  they do not want  /  can not complete a survey about it
-1	 @ Christianitymag Although I only watched 15 minutes in the middle ,  so not really a fair review  ;  ) 
-1	Someone needs to start selling large butterfly nets on Amazon ,  calling them drone catchers
-1	 @ tfaiso So no need to buy a new Mac Pro now then ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ MBrundleF1 If Grosjean can get from 17th to 3rd ,  Im sure Vettel could be sent to the back of the grid and still win !   ;  ) 
-1	 @ martinsaunders Ouch !  Im quite impressed at how Peter managed to more or less stay on key ! 
-1	 @ BBCWatchdog Supermarkets are right .  Back when I first started with microwave meals I got the  " serves 2 "  for just me .  Serves 1 is OK now . 
-1	 @ charlie _ whiting Perhaps if the investors hurried up and gave  @ Lotus _ F1Team their big cheque ,  Pastor could then rip his up and drive gokarts
-1	 @ McLarenF1 After 8 years  @ HiltonHHonors really ought to fix the HH typo
-1	 @ davelee Nah ,  someone will have stolen it already  ;  ) 
-1	 @ Carolinesymcox Already the startings of a liberal / trad argument in the reviews !  Does FAQ answer  " Why dont two Christians ever agree ?  "   ;  ) 
-1	 @ andrewbensonf1 Meanwhile the English cricket team are in desperate need of rain .  Perhaps if everyone blows at the same time .  .  . 
-1	 @ violetposy Bargain !  Imagine what the price would have been if theyd included windows .  .  . 
-1	 @ TimCAD Congratulations !  Take some paternity leave ,  That cute little chap is definitely more important than us lot  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ violetposy Ahh .  Well perhaps one of those bits of paper with the picture of the Queen and a number in the corner .  Teens like those too  ;  -  ) 
-1	Better to have one prize for a random existing follower  ( to stop unfollow - then - follow )  ,  and another prize for random new between now and xth
-1	 @ suziperry I could say something like  " Quicker than a Williams crew then "  ,  but that wouldnt be nice would it ?   :  ) 
-1	 @ davewalker It did start out in the kitchen .  But the lunch club needed space for the 15 pans they need ,  just in case 14 of them break
-1	 @ GrandPrixDiary We should be OK as long as Newey doesnt design his football boots .  .   ;  ) 
-1	 @ McGuireDavid  # giraffe I thought eyes ,  or window to tell them to get lost .  .  .   :  -  ) 
-1	 @ bobbyllew Well they do have the rights to F1 .  Perhaps they are scared of competition ,  since the tyres might actually go the distance in FE
-1	 @ tjathurman I think there is an app called Twitter which allows you to do that  ;  ) 
-1	 @ petejamesmusic The worship was amazing tonight  :  -  ) 
-1	 @ vickybeeching It looked even stranger the first time I read it ,  I thought it said a Moose had shot the pensioner  ;  ) 
-1	 @ dave1010 Yeah ,  but not much room for the shopping or the kids  ;  ) 
-1	 @ davewalker The tagline on our website is  " Serving Christ ,  serving our community "  .  Im now tempted to stick  " toast "  on the end  ;  ) 
-1	 @ davewalker  @ revkatebottley  * tries hard to read it ,  but fails *   :  ( 
-1	 @ tfaiso Do you have to carry a RAID enclosure on your back ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ tjathurman Yeah ,  should definitely be whose and they always forget the  " is "  after art too . 
-1	 @ EE I dont want to opt out of EE Recommends in 4 days I want out now .  In fact I would have preferred not to be optted in in the first place
-1	 @ tswyatt  @ churchtimes It had the special privilege of being stapled inside the back cover of our Mission England Praise songbooks  :  ) 
-1	 @ davewalker Ive not heard the germ - spreading argument about books !  Is this why those on laptop rota get ill together ?  Germs on keyboard  ;  )
