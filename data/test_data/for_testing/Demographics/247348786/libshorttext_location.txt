21	 @ GEORGIEevents  @ Eventice2014 Thank you Georgie !   :  ) 
21	 @ AnomalousLondon  @ UKBlogAwards you could have a blog page direct on your website so you are only managing one space ?   # bloghour

21	 @ becky _ brown91  @ oneand20  @ chemgradboom  @ essexgirldiary  @ suzym _ marie  @ NectarCollect  :  )  Merry Christmas everyone  :  ) 
21	 @ MissFrewin there is that !  Events can be amazing but they do take away a lot of free - time  & amp ;  that can make regular blogs impossible  # bloghour
21	 @ AnomalousLondon  @ RachelCDailey  ‚Ä¶ . are better platforms that allow for you to set up with your website  # bloghour
21	 @ Annie _ Squirrel  @ suzym _ marie  @ UKBlogAwards I might try mailchimp but not too sure people would read a newsletter  # bloghour
21	If you didn‚Äôt see  * because i‚Äôve been pretty absent *  I finally wrote a new quick update post on  @ Imdamnstudent 
21	 @ joanna _ isms I‚Äôm on blogger as well ,  I got my domain name about a  year ago via blogger  -  I went to settings  -  basic  & amp ;  down to publishing .  .  . 
21	 @ outmumbered  @ UKBlogAwards Thats the same for me Emma  :  ) 
21	Why when I have an assignment due in tomorrow can I not find the motivation to write a small 300 words  & amp ;  be done ?
