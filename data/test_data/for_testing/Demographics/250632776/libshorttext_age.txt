-0.5	First pointless fact of 2013 :  This is the first year since I was born where all digits of the year are different .

-0.5	I now have Android 4 . 2 . 2 ! 
-0.5	I love it when some people start their arrays at 1 rather than 0 .  Makes things really easy .   :  / 
-0.5	Any guesses as to how many bugs were introduced in last nights processing ? 
-0.5	 @ bendemes There was a login permissions error so I fixed it and wanted to reset the two failed requests .  .  . 
-0.5	So annoying when making a small mistake while playing a card game and then going on to losing . 
-0.5	 @ SimpossibleD Good idea .  I need something to stop me getting distracted today ! 
-0.5	Another reason why I dont run anti - virus software !   & gt ; Thousands of PCs internet access cut

-0.5	Argh !  I starting to hate Telerik .  All Im trying to do is make some HTML text bold ! 
-0.5	 @ bendemes Didnt realise win 8 has antivirus now though ! 
-0.5	After about an hour of debugging someone elses code I can confirm  .  .  .  it is broken .  No idea why though .   # ComplexCodeForNoReason
-0.5	 @ BigSpud Ive typed that so many times lately !  The program Im developing atm needs a login every time its run !  I keep mistyping my name  :  (
