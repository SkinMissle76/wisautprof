-1	 @ Ray6ba6bk no thanks
-1	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinsoi hate using the term  " muslim "  I wouldnt like to be labled a christian by the media . 
-1	 @ ChikkyJo  @ Peeka86  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson I see fair points in both arguments .  Ultimately we all need to stand up to the government

-1	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson i dont believe in revenge and no thats not okay either . 
-1	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson The fact that some muslims seem to think  # leerigbys killing was somehow OK makes our blood boil
