2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce you shouldnt genralize so much but I see your point .  I feel there needs to be more positive intergration between
2	 @  _ xFern I like the canadian accent lol
2	 @ Ray6ba6bk no thanks
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinsoi hate using the term  " muslim "  I wouldnt like to be labled a christian by the media . 
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ Peeka86  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson I see fair points in both arguments .  Ultimately we all need to stand up to the government
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson So do you not like the English ? 
2	 @ CharlieSloth lol thats just embarassing
2	 @  _ xFern manchestuurr
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson and never say  "  a christian has killed so and so " 
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson I agree with you with the murder of lee rigby .  I dont like how the media play on the word  # muslim
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ IIIIKHANIII  @ Peeka86  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson i agree with some of your points !   Either way this crap has to come to an end
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson not all edl members are racist ?  I am not a racist . 
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson i dont believe in revenge and no thats not okay either . 
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson The fact that some muslims seem to think  # leerigbys killing was somehow OK makes our blood boil
2	 @ ChikkyJo  @ darnellbabyfce  @ EDLTrobinson does that matter ?  We are standing up for ourselfs and will not let muslim law be enforced in the uk
2	 @  _ y0umakemewanna  @  _ GeorgieWood really ?  Wow what a nice guy .   # respect
