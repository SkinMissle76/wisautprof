2	 @ SocialistHealth Can be used oddly ,  Id agree .  What alternative would you suggest  -  premature ? 
2	 @ SocialistHealth Hmm .  . never bought the  " we start dying from the moment we are born "  idea ,  if thats what you were getting at ? 
2	Reminder from Stateside that palliative care isnt just for the dying ,  but can go alongside curative treatment

2	Whats the point of  @ DHgovuk putting  # endoflifecare in the Mandate if  @ NHSEngland doesnt follow that through in its planning guidance ? 
2	 # endoflifecare is improvement priority in Mandate so why scant reference in the draft planning guidance  @ nhsengland ?

2	 @ Palliative _ Scot  @ Richard56 Interesting :  is the cure v care polarisation we too often see in the NHS a manifestation of Mars v Venus ? 
2	 @ Palliative _ Scot  @ Richard56 Indeed so !  Yet here I am with about 100 Eolc facilitators of whom about 10 are men . 
2	 " Taxes will rise if we reject the nanny state "  spot - on by  @ aliceTTimes .  But Public Health needs to avoid nanny tone . 
2	Interested in Tweeps thoughts on last 2 retweets . 
2	2 / 2 MT “ @ Richard56 :  Partly cos they live longer  & amp ;  must care for dying men .  They can look death in the eye .  Men find it more difficult . ”
2	1 / 2 Thoughts ?  “ @ Richard56 :   # WISHDoha13 Women will be the best advocates for improving end of life care .  Men are useless .  Tom Hughes - Hallett”
2	 @ Richard56 Hmmm food for reflection .  Your view Richard or Toms ? 
2	 @ PeterASinger  @ Richard56 Agree .  Individual level outcome measures is the key next step for Eolc globally . 
2	 @ Richard56 Why ? 
2	 @ JeremyHughesAlz Congratulations Jeremy .  Thats terrific .  Do you know yet what the balance between cure  & amp ;  care will be when prioritising ? 
2	 @ PaulJRethink Its about balance .  Finding cure or effective symptom delay wd be extraordinary .  But we also need good care in here  & amp ;  now
2	NCPC also published guide to help ppl with dementia in pain  & amp ;  distress .  10 , 000 copies ordered just yday

2	NCPC has worked with partners since 2006 to improve  # endoflifecare for people with dementia .  More here  # G8dementia
2	Increasing research funding to £132m by 2025 wont bring many drugs to market .  But could radically transform quality of care  # G8dementia
2	 @ ClaireCater1  @ ProfRHarris Its more than engagement  -  we need to move towards partnership .  Huge implications for everyone .

2	 @ barbarajack14 Look forward to it .  Concept of national collection is vital . 
2	 @ barbarajack14  @ kesleeman  @ hospicedoctor Thanks Barbara .  It has quite a lot of value  ,  but EOLC needs it to have more . 
2	 @ TonyBonser Thanks Tony .  Im on the mend .  Look forward to seeing you too . 
2	 @ stb1106 That was my reaction too  :  -  ) 
2	 @ AliceFuller  @ Jo _ Cloth _ Ears My mind boggleth
2	 @ Jo _ Cloth _ Ears  .  . but couldnt have done it w / o help of  @ stb1106  @ DrLizSampson  @ AliceFuller  & amp ;  other brilliant members of our dementia group
2	 @ Jo _ Cloth _ Ears  @ AliceFuller Ummm .  .  .  I was the lead author on these .  .  .  . 
2	 @ kesleeman for example ,  the number of data fields doesnt feel particularly minimalist .  .  . 
2	Santas PR makeover .  If you havent read this ,  take a moment . 
2	 @ kesleeman  @ hospicedoctor tx .  Ive presented on the MDS several times when shes been present  & amp ;  she hasnt mentioned it before .  Will ask her
2	 @ hospicedoctor  @ kesleeman  @ AntoniaBunnin We are starting work to review / develop MDS .  Will be a long job .  Joint work for NCPC / HtH / PHE
2	 @ kesleeman  @ hospicedoctor interesting to hear that  -  who from ?

2	 @ jameschappers Has the selfie been released yet ? 
2	 @ CochranePaPaS  @ UKCochraneCentr Thanks .  pdf fixed  -  it was a Firefox issue  -  see here for note 
2	 @ UKCochraneCentr  @ CochranePaPaS Thank you !  Have just spotted a problem with the pdf which well try to fix too
2	 @ UKCochraneCentr  @ CochranePaPaS Thank you  -  please wd you send a link when you do ? 
2	 @ dwilliamsHSJ  @ HPIAndyCowper It will never work properly until  importance of putting people  ( not patients BTW !  )  at its heart is understood
2	 @ dwilliamsHSJ  @ HPIAndyCowper  @ NickGolding You can co - design the aims  & amp ;  criteria of the fund  & amp ;  ensure all applications co - designed too . 
2	 @ UKCochraneCentr  @ CochranePaPaS Thank you !  We were asked to write this by 10 Downing St as part of the PM dementia challenge
2	 @ HPIAndyCowper  @ dwilliamsHSJ  @ NickGolding So much wrong with that am tempted to start  # susan and send long tweets ,  but need to work now  ;  -  ) 
2	 @ HPIAndyCowper  @ dwilliamsHSJ  @ NickGolding Will it work if its not co - designed with people  & amp ;  meets their needs not those the NHS perceives ? 
2	 @ dwilliamsHSJ  @ HPIAndyCowper  @ NickGolding Agree BCF banal ,  hence adding coordinated .  This fund must be designed around people not system . 
2	 @ dwilliamsHSJ  @ HPIAndyCowper  @ NickGolding Hmmm .  .  .  .  .  But this fund certainly does .  Im going to bring in  @ JeremyTaylorNV for a view . 
2	Weve just had an order for 10 , 000 copies of our guide on helping people with  # dementia in pain  & amp ;  distress 
2	 @ HPIAndyCowper  @ NickGolding  @ dwilliamsHSJ Who do they mean something to ?  Not the people who experience it . 
2	 @ HPIAndyCowper  @ NickGolding  @ dwilliamsHSJ  " Integration Transformation "  is provider - focused jargon .   " Better coordinated care  "  wd be better . 
2	 @ TTESmith Good piece Tes !
