19	 @ marcoarment agree
19	 @ RKSupport Facebook integration is not fixed after a month .  And Jawbone UP integration fails to work .  May have to start using Strava . 
19	 @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ timmay2  @ thinkbroadband mine sits around 25 / 30mb with up to 40mb .  I measure this with how long it takes to stream Netflix . 
19	 @ donmcallister  @ MacSparky  @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ DaveHamilton my company  @ SmartNestUK custom build  @ sonos in the home  ~  & gt ;  
19	 @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ timmay2 it can be done but with dodgy firmwares and hours of tinkering .  I am going to go easy route .  Keep hub connected . 
19	 @ motech  @ everpix  ;   ( 
19	 @  _ RichS woh !  Whats driving them bad boys ?  I assume your dad built these ? 
19	How strange .  Installed the new iWork and iLife apps on my iPhone running iOS 7 . 03 and the apps are the old ones .  I now need to click update ! 
19	 @ thecolesy good luck
19	 @ motech  @ swein but not sure it support iOS 7 auto import in the background ?  ? 
19	 @ donmcallister  @ MacSparky  @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ DaveHamilton name the airport  " Sonos "  and in the settings make it come on in specific rooms  :   ) 
19	 @ supercoollee yes .  we start work on some HDL goodness next week . 
19	After 2 months of waiting I have finally received my iPhone 5S .  Its a totally different experience apart from I just had my first crash . 
19	Thanks to  @ simplicitybliss for your step by step guide to organising photographs with  @ Noodle _ Hazel and  @ dropbox .   :   ) 
19	 @ TheMacFixer thx  :   ) 
19	 @ motech  @ everpix Replacing everpix 
19	 @ marcobarrios  @ uniboxapp I like the look of this . 
19	 @ picturelife I have photos imported from your iOS apps ,  Dropbox and Facebook .  How does your service deal with duplicates ? 
19	 @ timmay2  @ ChrisHumphreys _  in the end I took Draytek out as its a ugly thing and dont require its features .  Fixed a IP on sky hub for it . 
19	 @ motech  @ swein I’m going back to basics .  Dropbox / Year / Month / JPG .  Using  @ Noodle _ Hazel to organise .  Then I will find a app to point at folder . 
19	 @ motech  @ swein it’s not beautiful but  @ dropbox auto uploads from all devices .  On iOS the Dropbox app has a phot view of all photos date ord . 
19	Failed setting up Draytek with Sky Fibre .  Any help would be appreciated .  I have the username and password .  Just need help with settings . 
19	Sky fibre was activated today .  Before I can use my Draytek 2860 I need to use Wireshark to sniff login credentials .  
19	 @ picturelife your iPhone app on a 4s logs me out periodically .  Any reason ? 
19	 @ RPG _ Europe  @ Go4Control  @ LiveInstall You may find these helpful . 
19	10 days in and its time to charge my  @ Jawbone UP .  Its been attached to me the whole time .  Today did my first 10000 
19	 @ jasontoheal as a power user the only apple device I can rely on is my MacBook Pro .  It just works .  iOS feels so amateur right now .   :   ( 
19	 @ SmartNestUK  @ ArtcousticUK is it not a bit early for a rave ? 
19	Loving the new  @ tweetbot 3 .  It feels somewhat familiar .  Nice work  @ tapbot _ paul ! 
19	 @ japbespokeav  @ iSmart _ Home its a nice refinement .  No nasty shocks ! 
19	 @ marcobarrios so you missed the keynote ?  I thought everything was forward in Norway ?  ? 
19	 @ danbretl  @ picturelife is there a specific time notifications are sent ?  Its 10 : 19 AM GMT and yet to receive a notification .  Shall I delete ? 
19	Merry Christmas everyone ! 
19	 @ customised see you at lunch  :   ) 
19	 @ neilcochrane1 that’s was very thoughtful of you .   :   ) 
19	 @ motech  @ swein also supports video . 
19	 @ picturelife where is that memories notification feature that I loved ?  Has it been removed from iOS ? 
19	The Jambox Mini by  @ Jawbone is fantastic .  Incredible sound from a 7 hour portable Bluetooth speaker .  The speakerphone is also crystal clear . 
19	 @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ timmay2  @ OfficiaIApple its a  " feature "   ;   ) 
19	Moved house and now starting to get back into the headspace of twitter . 
19	 @ mosey  @ marcobarrios check these guys out  ~  & gt ;   @ coin
19	 @ motech I am still interested to see your  @ Podio setup .  I am pretty satisfied with mine . 
19	 @ simplicitybliss any effective way of deleting duplicate photos with  @ Noodle _ Hazel ?  I am cautious as some photos could have the same name . 
19	Sky Fibre Broadband Day .  Unlimited 40mb .  I will no longer use mobile data like an animal . 
19	 @ danbretl  @ picturelife ok I dont know how but I must have untucked the notification settings .  Thanks .  Hopefully get one tomorrow !   :   ) 
19	 @ motech  @ picturelife  @ everpix the trouble is that is a specialist requirement .  I have nothing to hide  ;   ) 
19	 @ motech  @ swein what are pros and cons ?  I see it being my primary picture place .  But still need to work out a way of getting pictures local . 
19	 @ marcobarrios  @ Mosey I don’t know how essential a chip is ?  I use them on my cards everyday but think you can use the stripe alternatively ? 
19	My new toys .  Weekend project to install  @ plexapp  @ dropbox  @ picturelife  @ Noodle _ Hazel .  Setting up  @ iruleathome on iPad 
19	 @ picturelife in other words can I have my pictures uploaded to your service and also synced down to a local computer i . e .  my Lounge Mac mini
19	 @ donavoncade  @ whichwich that looks awesome .  Come to the UK ! 
19	Parrot car kit installed at  @ Halfords _ uk Basingstoke .  Returned many times due to faults .  Refunded parts but not labour ?  ?  A un - happy customer

19	I have uploaded 29 , 485 photos to  @ picturelife .  Also a bunch of these are from my social networks .  Photos everywhere !  
19	 @ timmay2  @ ChrisHumphreys _  my previous post said I would just keep the hub connected  & amp ;  connect via wan2  ( giga )  .  Should be simple He says  ;   ) 
19	 @ viticci you have good taste . 
19	 @ swein  @ motech  @ Dropbox basically this is all a bit of a mess and this could all happen again when investing time into another service…  :   / 
19	 @ customised  @ SmartNestUK it’s all coming together bit by bit .  Noah is up the ladders tomorrow fitting the dish while I’m in the warm .   :   ) 
19	 @ picturelife thanks for feedback .  What market are you targeting ?  It’s a lovely app .  Can you support iOS monthly subscription pls ?   @ swein
19	 @ marcobarrios I agree with everything you say .  I may feel different when  @ O2 pull there finger out and send me my iPhone 5S . 
19	 @ customised just had a brain wave .   # LiveInstall Podcast  ;   ) 
19	 @ TheMacFixer after shoving a blank disc in which I was happy to lose I managed to get the mechanism working again .  Maybe knocked in transit ? 
19	At least when I stream anything over airplay my battery is maintained .  Jambox Mini with airplay .  .  .  That would be awesome  @ Jawbone
19	 @ customised totally ,  but how big a audience ?  I’ll discuss further on yammer tonight . 
19	Can someone please tell me if iMovie theatre / theater iCloud storage uses my 5gb free ?  Or is it like iCloud photo albums which are free ? 
19	 @ picturelife  @ motech  @ innonate could I take the same approach but get my whole family on board ?  £5 each user with 75GB storage ?   # referral
19	 @ Mike _ Selley not sure it will run on my Macbook Pro .  It was made before before my time .   :   ) 
19	 @ iSmart _ Home will do .  What’s the worse that can happen…not get any work done ? 
19	Anyone noticed the  @ vimeo app background on the Apple TV has changed blue ?   # appletv
19	 @ neilcochrane1 what’s this ?  Are you in Bstoke ? 
19	 @ donmcallister is it just me or does apple make it hard work to understand what the limits are for photostream .  How can it replace  @ everpix ? 
19	 @ LiveInstall yes .  But i am in the process of moving house so won’t be for a week I expect .   @ noahderrington seems to be in the process though
19	 @ motech  @ swein hmmm adobe so could be around for some time ?  ? 
19	Since using touch ID for the last few hours it has forgotten my finger prints twice .   " Touch ID Off " 
19	“ @ FlorisvdSande :   @ imyke  @ viticci I’ve written a blogpost about my iCloud Photo stream replacement for  @ everpix 
19	 @ MacSparky  @ donmcallister  @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ DaveHamilton you can set the Sonos to come  " on "  automatically on receiving signal from AEX BTW . 
19	 @ MacSparky  @ donmcallister  @ ChrisHumphreys _   @ DaveHamilton apologies its actually called Autoplay Zone  ( feature )   ~  & gt ;  
19	 @ simplicitybliss great posts .  I havent quite moved over to the dark side yet but wondering if you can implement these in iOS as well ? 
19	Ordered my Mac Mini 2010 with the built in DVD drive .  Will be my home media server .   @ dropbox  @ Noodle _ Hazel  @ plexapp .  Awesome !   :   ) 
19	 @ motech did you get an email from  @ squareonemail ? 
19	 @ picturelife I currently have you guys managing my pictures in the cloud and  @ Dropbox managing them local  ( with bg sync )  .  Could you do both ?

19	 @ picturelife ok now you mention it a few other apps do this also .  By the way loving the app .  When am I supposed to get memories notification
19	 @ motech  @ swein I lie . 
19	 @ swein  @ motech could you use  @ FileTransporter or  @ dropbox as means of storing the photos with  @ picturelife ? 
19	 @ donavoncade  @ businessinsider WTF
19	 @ customised that’s a tease .  Noah and I are in Ascot if you fancy meeting us for lunch ? 
19	 @ motech great post .   @ picturelife is perfect for my requirements .  It’s clean and simple .  I actually prefer it to  @ everpix . 
19	 @ picturelife  @ motech  @ innonate  *  $ 5
19	 @ motech you know what I totally agree with your requirements now .   ;   ) 
19	Loved Anchorman 2 .  It was never going to beat the first one but still great effort !  
19	 @ motech  @ swein have you tried the “explore” feature on the iOS app ?  Think Kaleidescape but pictures .  . 
19	I just donated to the  @ britishredcross  # Typhoon Haiyan Appeal .  Please donate at

19	Disappointed to hear that  @ everpix is closing down .  Flashback was a product I used every day .  Dropbox have a camera upload feature I suppose

19	 @ customised iPhone 5S third charge today  # FiveWordTechHorrors
19	The Up wrist band by  @ Jawbone is on trial to see how I get on with it .  I think we will see many competitors coming out at CES in January . 
19	 @  _ RichS  @ coin I want ! 
19	 @ picturelife  @ danbretl any news guys ? 
19	 @ TheRealJoeCox  @ customised  @ LiveInstall podcasts are a lot of work .  People listen to them more and more .  But is certainly a niche market . 
19	 @  _ RichS nicely done .  Mine are nothing special .  Cambridge audio .  They work .  Business is great .  Currently building Smart Home in Ascot .   :   ) 
19	Thats great Apple .  iOS 7 has another alarm bug .  Woke up naturally checked the phone and its snoozing .  Wait a couple of minutes  -  no sound ! 
19	Im fed up with iOS .  Multitasking is unpredictable .  Composing a email and referencing safari webpage .  When returning to mail its gone ! 
19	 @ electriccrabb thanks for your help this evening with identifying  @ iruleathome issues .  Much appreciated .  Good to catch up with you .   :   ) 
19	Another  # mavericks install .  I have no idea what the performance will be on this White MacBook .  Fingers crossed .  
19	 @ mdm _ tech  @ OmniGraffle yep .  Building a nice selection of stencils so it’s almost a drag and drop experience .  Thx
19	 @ marcobarrios I almost hate iOS 7 .  I am used to the look and feel but it’s painfully buggy and almost unusable as a power user .   :   (
