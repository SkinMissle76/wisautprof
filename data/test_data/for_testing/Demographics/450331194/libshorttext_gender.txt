-1	 @ MattsCravat looks like giant Rupert Bear !  !  Awesome  -  setting a trend ,  pushing the envelope ! 
-1	 @ Optus for a major commuter route the coverage is poor and cell hand - over unreliable  -  maps are simulations ,  get on the train ! 
-1	 @ Optus  ( Craig )  bad coverage between Gosford / Woy Woy ,  none in Kuringai ,  no data at Pymble ,  data drops out a lot most of the way
-1	 @ EBGamesAus would be nice to see  " I have "  and  " I want "  buttons on items in your online store if logged in
-1	Model plane clings to vertical surfaces  -  could be useful exploring on Mars ?

-1	For  # TheTruthAboutFat read 
-1	 # TheTruthAboutFat is that sugar and starch raise blood glucose which triggers insulin which makes your body store fat 
-1	Why arent they discussing diet in  # TheTruthAboutFat ?  
-1	 @ optus coverage so bad on north shore line  & amp ;  not improving ,  going to have to switch to  @ telstra  & gt ;  :  [ 
-1	 @ ReactionEngines when can we get some news on SABRE ?  Whats the next step after the successful test firing ? 
-1	 @ biggestloser _ au is all about entertainment for the masses .  We also need a show with some scientific credibility . 
-1	 @ rapaul yes I watched that ,  good but was a bit quick on some details ,  hence why I looked for you on Twitter .  Maybe Ill write something .  .  . 
-1	 @ rapaul Im getting the hang of it now ,  but a comprehensive guide would be useful for those new to Groovy and Cucumber
-1	 @ rapaul yeah I had a look at the example but its a bit contrived and doesnt really explain things like hooks very well
-1	Move over NASA 
-1	Augmented reality for paper docs 
-1	
-1	DIY village !  
-1	Why oh why is  @ biggestloser _ au still telling Big Fat Lies ?  
-1	 @ StarWalk awesomest astronomy app ,  but why is the Large Magellanic Cloud still not shown in the search ? 
-1	 @ spacegovuk  @ ReactionEngines  @ esa thats great thanks ,  reducing launch costs is surely the key to exploring / exploiting space
-1	 @ spacegovuk to what extent is the UK government supporting  @ ReactionEngines and their SSTO vision ? 
-1	 @ markfos21515630 FYI  @ goldenspikeco
-1	 @ Philtill777  @ markfos21515630   .  .  .  umm ,  Im a noob tweeter ,  what is a tweet with all these tags for ?

-1	 @ Optus its been bad since New Year and Ive restarted my iPhone many times since then  -  just 2 . 5G and EDGE no 3G
-1	If inertial  & amp ;  grav .  mass r both electromagnetic in origin then is  # generalrelativity just a mathematical side - effect
-1	 @ markfos21515630  @ reactionengines its going viral at Mach 5 +  !  ! 
-1	 @ iceinspace jeepers the Star Party costs a lot !  I was going to bring some interested teens but just too expensive  :  ( 
-1	 # generalrelativity asserts that inertial and gravitational mass are equivalent  -  a better theory would explain why
-1	 @ Optus why has 3G coverage gone between Gosford and Woy Woy ?  Or is it just the iPhone 5 misbehaving ?

-1	So much physics rests on things like Coulombs Law which assumes point particles ,  yet we know such things dont exist . 
-1	
-1	Model charged particles as charged rings and you get inertia from acceleration interaction with own EM field .  Inertial mass from charge ! 
-1	Coulombs law similar to Newtons .  Coincidence ?  Not if mass is derived from charge .  Space - time - charge may be all we need . 
-1	More detail on the Skylon vision .  Doesnt need fragile tiles as reentry speed is slower than Shuttle .   
-1	 @ GoDeepSpace  @ markfos21515630 DSI should give support  ( moral if not financial )  to  @ ReactionEngines Skylon would cut launch costs by 75 % 
-1	 @ ExtrasolarDream  # projecttroy 
-1	Transactional interpretation 
-1	 @ markfos21515630 and this 
-1	 @ markfos21515630 you might be interested in this

-1	 @ markfos21515630 got your ticket yet ?  ?  Really hoping that the UK government recognises a goldmine when they see it
-1	 @ ReactionEngines  @ TheIET did you win ?  ? 
-1	 @ markfos21515630  @ ReactionEngines Im a huge fan too !  Thats at least two of us going to help them get the UK back into space .
