21	 @ EnergyAustralia thanks but my point was the website should make that information really easy to find ,  as it has a BIG impact on our bills
21	Moffats MOG  # modifiedgravity doesnt need dark matter ,  but isnt the phion field the same thing ,  kind of ? 
21	 @ twumlet would be awesome if you created a Confluence plug - in for drawing UMLet diagrams on wiki pages
21	 @ EnergyAustralia why is it so hard to find out what your peak / off - peak electricity times are ?  You used to have a nice chart
21	Tiny speakers use carbon nano - wires to heat air .  .  .  
21	Universe a collapsed 4D star ?  Like the surface of a bubble ,  crystallising out of 3D space ,  history being inside the bubble . 
21	Bought  " Reinventing Gravity "  ,  looking forward to some new ideas .  
21	So wish Australia had some stuff like  # socialspace going on .  All we have is a recently failed scramjet experiment .   =  ( 
21	Brilliant agile tool ,  simpler than Pivotal Tracker if you dont need the emergent planning stuff :  
21	We want Hyperloops !  !  
21	I thought wed already cracked this with telomerase 
21	Doh !  
21	 @ rapaul I added comments to the Groovy example in Cucumber - JVM .  Hope that helps someone ;  it has been quite an adventure ! 
21	 @ Optus service on train between Gosford and Sydney has improved a bit :  kept a call up from Wynyard to Berowra ! 
21	Gotta get me one of these 
21	Cucumber testing is not as easy as it looks if the software under test hasnt been designed for test automation  =  \

21	 @ MattsCravat looks like giant Rupert Bear !  !  Awesome  -  setting a trend ,  pushing the envelope ! 
21	 @ Optus for a major commuter route the coverage is poor and cell hand - over unreliable  -  maps are simulations ,  get on the train ! 
21	 @ Optus  ( Craig )  bad coverage between Gosford / Woy Woy ,  none in Kuringai ,  no data at Pymble ,  data drops out a lot most of the way
21	 @ EBGamesAus would be nice to see  " I have "  and  " I want "  buttons on items in your online store if logged in
21	Model plane clings to vertical surfaces  -  could be useful exploring on Mars ?  
21	 @ Optus thanks for asking ,  coverage on the North Shore line no better ,  do Optus ever test on the trains ?  Cell hand - over is bad . 
21	For  # TheTruthAboutFat read 
21	 # TheTruthAboutFat is that sugar and starch raise blood glucose which triggers insulin which makes your body store fat 
21	Why arent they discussing diet in  # TheTruthAboutFat ?  
21	 @ optus coverage so bad on north shore line  & amp ;  not improving ,  going to have to switch to  @ telstra  & gt ;  :  [ 
21	 @ ReactionEngines when can we get some news on SABRE ?  Whats the next step after the successful test firing ? 
21	 @ biggestloser _ au is all about entertainment for the masses .  We also need a show with some scientific credibility . 
21	 @ rapaul yes I watched that ,  good but was a bit quick on some details ,  hence why I looked for you on Twitter .  Maybe Ill write something .  .  . 
21	 @ rapaul Im getting the hang of it now ,  but a comprehensive guide would be useful for those new to Groovy and Cucumber
21	 @ rapaul yeah I had a look at the example but its a bit contrived and doesnt really explain things like hooks very well
21	Move over NASA 
21	Augmented reality for paper docs 
21	
21	DIY village !  
21	Why oh why is  @ biggestloser _ au still telling Big Fat Lies ?  
21	 @ StarWalk awesomest astronomy app ,  but why is the Large Magellanic Cloud still not shown in the search ? 
21	 @ spacegovuk  @ ReactionEngines  @ esa thats great thanks ,  reducing launch costs is surely the key to exploring / exploiting space
21	 @ spacegovuk to what extent is the UK government supporting  @ ReactionEngines and their SSTO vision ? 
21	 @ markfos21515630 FYI  @ goldenspikeco
21	 @ Philtill777  @ markfos21515630   .  .  .  umm ,  Im a noob tweeter ,  what is a tweet with all these tags for ?

21	Just got Anno 2070 from  @ Ubisoft cos I fancy building my own Eco - City
21	 @ Optus got Apple to replace my iPhone 5 but still gets bad signal for long stretches of northern rail commuter route
21	 @ rapaul any suggestions for good comprehensive tutorial on Cucumber - JVM with Groovy ? 
21	Paintball with asteroids 
21	 @ Optus its been bad since New Year and Ive restarted my iPhone many times since then  -  just 2 . 5G and EDGE no 3G
21	If inertial  & amp ;  grav .  mass r both electromagnetic in origin then is  # generalrelativity just a mathematical side - effect
21	 @ markfos21515630  @ reactionengines its going viral at Mach 5 +  !  ! 
21	 @ iceinspace jeepers the Star Party costs a lot !  I was going to bring some interested teens but just too expensive  :  ( 
21	 # generalrelativity asserts that inertial and gravitational mass are equivalent  -  a better theory would explain why
21	 @ Optus why has 3G coverage gone between Gosford and Woy Woy ?  Or is it just the iPhone 5 misbehaving ? 
21	 @ BocaLupo stash found at IGA North Sydney  -  getting harder to track down this drink in the CBD
21	Wondering :  whats a good telescope for trying out astrophotography without splashing out a small fortune ?   # Astronomy
21	 @ wiredscience have you covered the SABRE Mach 5 +  SSTO spaceplane engine from  @ ReactionEngines  ?  ? 
21	We gotta get set up on a few more planets before another like this hits .  .  .  
21	What happens if we start from the ground up with standing waves in space - time - charge ? 
21	So much physics rests on things like Coulombs Law which assumes point particles ,  yet we know such things dont exist . 
21	
21	Model charged particles as charged rings and you get inertia from acceleration interaction with own EM field .  Inertial mass from charge ! 
21	Coulombs law similar to Newtons .  Coincidence ?  Not if mass is derived from charge .  Space - time - charge may be all we need . 
21	More detail on the Skylon vision .  Doesnt need fragile tiles as reentry speed is slower than Shuttle .   
21	 @ GoDeepSpace  @ markfos21515630 DSI should give support  ( moral if not financial )  to  @ ReactionEngines Skylon would cut launch costs by 75 % 
21	 @ ExtrasolarDream  # projecttroy 
21	Transactional interpretation 
21	 @ markfos21515630 and this 
21	 @ markfos21515630 you might be interested in this 
21	 @ TheIET  @ reactionengines  : o (  you was robbed !  How is a strain gauge more awesome than an engine that gives us single - stage to orbit ?  ? 
21	Got a fab idea for an iOS app  -  looking forward to some OpenGL fun ,  wonder if there are open - source 3D games I can sneak a peek at .  .  . 
21	Reply to  @ mikeoid  @ markfos21515630 Alan Bond is definitely looking ahead with Project TROY 
21	 @ markfos21515630 got your ticket yet ?  ?  Really hoping that the UK government recognises a goldmine when they see it
21	 @ ReactionEngines  @ TheIET did you win ?  ? 
21	 @ markfos21515630  @ ReactionEngines Im a huge fan too !  Thats at least two of us going to help them get the UK back into space . 
21	If you have a baby with eczema you try anything .  We tried homeopathy and it really worked .  Safe ,  fast ,  seriously worth a try .    # TodayTonight
