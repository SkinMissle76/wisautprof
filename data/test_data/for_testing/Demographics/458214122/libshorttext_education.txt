2	 @ NoLookPass7 were not far off being a really good team
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ Deano _ saur feel good mate .  And think i played well lol .  Just some sloppy long ,  wide balls caught us out
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ Deano _ saur mate .  Attitude was MUCH better tonight .  Lacking a GK tho .  Any ideas ? 
2	 @ NoLookPass7 report ? 
2	 @ NoLookPass7 not by the looks of it mate  :  ( 
2	 @ KerryPoulson1 i will never share eye contact with you again !  !  !  !  !

2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ ATFC1sts who are the potential 5 mate ? 
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ ATFC1sts is there just the 1 so far .  Or any others ? 
2	 @ RealNelleyEllis  @ Deano _ saur  @ dipple09 grrrrrrrrrrrr
2	 @ RealNelleyEllis  @ Deano _ saur  @ dipple09 what was the formation / squad mate ? 
2	 @ RealNelleyEllis score mate ? 
2	 @ NoLookPass7 score mate ? 
2	“ @ RachelCrocombe :   # whattheheck 
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve yeah .  And if the fines from sat must be some incentive too . 
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve this is the problem .  If me and you gave up every time we lost the ball ,  like some players .  It would be even worse
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve there would be no emphasis on the formation / players etc
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve i like 3 t the back .  But we need cover .  Like you said .  If we were scoring the goals we SHOULD be , 
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve that is true .  But we get caught being over - run a lot .  Which hopefully will change with a different formation ? 
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve yeah .  Plus we havnt had the needed cover from wing - backs .  Poulson needs to get his new boots on !  !  !   # wontbelong
2	 @ jimmyalve haha .  Im sure you will find a way to push
2	 @ jimmyalve yeah .  You ,  mumf and Lew could be INTERESTING
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve and tomoz we will have to have a new member of the 3 ,  so we will soon see if its me haha
2	 @ NoLookPass7  @ jimmyalve not at all mate .  I dont think us 3 work together .  Thats all . 
2	 @ jimmyalve haha available i think your Daves easiest decision .  Lewis playing too ? 
2	 @ jimmyalve i know haha .  You back ? 
2	 @ jimmyalve yeah .  Im not there .  But i will be on the phone to the gaffer for an update
2	 @ jimmyalve i dunno mate .  Yea ,  i would LOVE 4 at the back .  But cant see it happening .  I just dnt think we are the quickest at the back lol . 
2	 @ jimmyalve yeah .  I dunno if its the right 3 at the back .  But 3 - 5 - 2 could work
2	 @ jimmyalve it was shocking mate .  The formation did nobody any favours .  But the attitude was still poor all round
2	 @ KerryPoulson1 haha .  He should educate you on different types of Pie to have with his mash and liquor .  While listening to Chaz and Dave
2	 @ KerryPoulson1 you need to remember ,  they dont have that kind of thing in Battersea ! 
2	 @ jimmyalve instead ,  we have to listen to Carraghers shit English ! 
2	 @ NoLookPass7 yeah mate .  No worries
2	 @ NoLookPass7 Nick ?  Yeah .  He is a good lad .  Hope he is coming .  Webby and Mark should hopefully be staying with us .  Bit of cover at the back
2	 @ NoLookPass7 ahhh mannnn .   # prayforjimmyD
2	 @ NoLookPass7 fuck !  How come ?
