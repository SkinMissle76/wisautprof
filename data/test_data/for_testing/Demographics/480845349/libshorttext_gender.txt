-1	 @ klausdodds  @ LauraPrazeres  @ RHULGeography They were amazing !

-1	 @ Samsaville  @ BenAndersonGeog  @ AU _ DGES your seminar series just sounds fantastic ! 
-1	The problem is there are too many interesting conferences I would like to go to but it would often require being in two places at once . 
-1	May have another potentially - punful thesis title on running .  Will have to wait and see if I decide on this topic though . 
-1	 @ jeckythump  @ CorkGeog Not yet Jecky .  Just something  ( hopefully )  in the pipeline  -  a one - off event we hope to turn into a series .  Well see ! 
-1	 @ JamesManthorp Also I hope to plan a trip back to Plym at some point in early 2014 . 
-1	 @ Samsaville its far too risky to go to Aber !   # storm
-1	 @ JamesManthorp no ,  I dont know where ownership lies either ,  but its open access as far as Im concerned
-1	 @ RHULGeography  @ olimould Id suspect that too
-1	 @ RHULGeography That would be Bratislava ,  Slovakia  # witw

-1	 # MyHEday trying to plan my first draft of geographies on encounter essay .  Hard when I know there is so much more I want to read on it . 
-1	 @ JamesManthorp We could ,  but I am giving it up as a New Year resolution .  Hot chocolate stain  -  does that work ?  Plymouth under water yet ? 
-1	 @ DrKAParkhill Much appreciate the retweet ,  thank you
-1	 @ RHULGeography O I doubt it .  Welcome all challengers though ! 
-1	Great news for the European Cross Country Championships in Belgrade today as fellow  @ RoyalHolloway student  @ emeliagorecka wins junior gold !

-1	A fantastic project  -  I urge you all to get involved RT  "  @ GeoCollective :  Join a Misplaced Geography Project 
-1	 @ JamesManthorp And i dont event drink it !  Shows how fake the whole thing is ! 
-1	 @ IngaBrecht No I havent but I have also had things like that .  How weird !  X
-1	 @ GeographyGreg Also ,  learn how to answer a question as well as the content .  How to structure an argument ,  how to write with authority etc . 
-1	Going through some backed - up emails and found this gem via  @ StuartElden  - Disused tube stations mapped :  
-1	 @ sibentley262 will do .  When will it be released ?  Yes really enjoying it ,  will be doing a thesis running related ,  not sure what yet though ! 
-1	 @ Oldmanmackie Pfft ,  what does he know ?  Yes good thanks ,  yourself ?  Currently trying to knuckle down an essay but being distracted by xmas ! 
-1	 @ DoctoralNet I am definitely a binge writer .  Love seeing it all come together at from a whole bunch of orderless notes and scribbles . 
-1	I go through phases of word fetishes .  I am currently fixated with foster / fosters / fostered / fostering .  Thank god for the thesaurus  # acwri
-1	 @ CorkGeog I know ,  doubt Ill get accepted but I may as well give it a go .  Did the see the Australian Geographer CFP on sensuous mobilities ? 
-1	 @ CorkGeog Very much something tbc .  We did propose an RGS Sess based on it by an email error meant it didnt work out  -  still hopeful though . 
-1	 @ GeographyGreg best way forward that is Greg .  Recommend it whole - heartedly .  Head in the sand ,  cant beat it . 
-1	Why is starting always the hardest bit ? 
-1	 @ Oldmanmackie I cant Alan ,  they are just to jolly ! 
-1	I hope to get round to reading this new paper by Jennie Middleton  @ TSUOxford and Richard Yarwood  @ PlymGeog today 
-1	The more I write mobile video ethnography the more Im dislike it .  Surely there is something catchier ?   @ RichardScriven  @ psimpy any ideas ? 
-1	Occasionally late trains are great .  It meant I got home 30mins earlier as I no longer had to wait at a connection .  But only occasionally . 
-1	 @ FillBenson an occasionally the elusive person who cant walk properly and has a tatoo on their face . 
-1	 @ GeographyGreg Its not just about the content ,  you need 2 get yourself in the right frame of mind to sit the exam  -  dont get 2 stressed . 
-1	 @ amycutler1985  @ RHULGeography Congratulations ! 
-1	 @ AnsonMackay I did give coke up for 6 weeks last summer but then decided that it was really tasty so fancied it again .  Happy New Year btw
-1	 @ MrLaytonJ  .  .  .  get to start doing some proper research next term .  Just got to decide upon a thesis topic .  Im sure itll be running related . 
-1	 @ GeographyGreg Tip Number 1  -  dont fuck it up
-1	 @ psimpy Haha ,  there is something a bit astray there .  1500 is a short contribution ?  ! 
-1	 @ MsFloraPoste Id take the other hand ! 
-1	 @ AmyJones _ Cymru  @ jeckythump sounds great ! 
-1	Some very in - depth long - term planning occurring today .  Then hopefully actually getting on with the plans  # MyHEday
-1	 @ RHULGeography Cape Town ,  South Africa  # witw
-1	 @ HelenPallett Thanks  -  Ive no talent at all so used Phoster  ( IoS app )  .  Very easy to use  & amp ;  really nice templates .  
-1	 @ psimpy Ah I see ,  but of course you are pleased to be part of the project !  Whats your entry on ? 
-1	 @ MrLaytonJ no hadnt spotted that yet ,  thanks very much will have to check it out ! 
-1	Exhibit A :  an excellent paper on encounters with the dogs in pubic space I wish I has written  /  had planned to write 
-1	 @ CorkGeog aha ,  thats very good to hear .  From what you were telling me ,  sounds like it would be a fab issue . 
-1	Anybody have any New Year Resolutions ,  academic or otherwise ?  Here are mine :  
-1	 @ stefanmanku  @ NickyJ93  @ UniStudentFacts I am the 8 % 
-1	 @ CorkGeog Ill forward it to you ,  looks very much up your street ,  with hopes of an edited book also .  Hope the deadline hasnt passed ! 
-1	 @ jeckythump  @ CorkGeog Had to google it ,  but what a corker of a word  # wordexchange  # acwri
-1	 @ GeographyGreg Sarcastic yes ,  but sadly ,  also my choice of tactic .  I convince myself that I can write 20 , 000 words a day if required . 
-1	 @ aliteralgirl Best kind of procrastination
-1	Could be of interest to  @ PlymGeog transport students MT :   @ acdavids :  Phds available at Institute for Transport Studies 
-1	 # xmassongsaspapers is well worth a read .  Who said academics are boring ! 
-1	 @ JamesManthorp Yeah sounds pretty simple .  I quite like Figshare for that sort of stuff . 
-1	 @ Oldmanmackie Well I would love to take your praise ,  but not sure the girlfriend would be too impressed !  Best of luck ! 
-1	 @ mills _ sarah  @ PlymGeog still waiting for mine ! 
-1	 @ CorkGeog O youve spoilt me .  I think we can foster a nice practice of peer - assistance through  # wordexchange  # acwri
-1	 @ jeckythump  @ CorkGeog Ill be sure to tell you ! 
-1	 @ ginatucker199 tut ,  bloody students ! 
-1	 @ aliteralgirl  @ RHULGeography Great piece and a nice reminder that I need to get mine down on paper .  Essays first I suppose though . 
-1	 @ MrLaytonJ Snap !  How is the dissertation coming along ?  Im guessing impressively from what Ive seen . 
-1	 @ JamesManthorp Ok ,  well set a date for early next year ?  And yes ,  an old - boys meet up sounds great ! 
-1	 @ AndreaTucker3 On a monday ?  You doing art club ? 
-1	Love these .  We need to get MA mugs !   @ HarrietGeogArt  @ RHULGeography  @ mereplacenames  @ Ruairi _ OShea  @ camillakthomas  @ BenNew92  @ LIVINGSTONZARA
-1	 @ acdavids  @ CorkGeog Yes she does .  Sent you another email this morning  -  more promising
-1	 @ JamesManthorp No worries mate ,  I realise its a long way .  But you have an open invite !  Before 6th Dec ? 
-1	It takes me a while to get the cogs going ,  but I do really enjoy writing .  Even on a friday evening  # acwri  # phdchat  # ECRchat
-1	Did my first ever spot of co - writing over the w / end with  @ acdavids  -  very enjoyable ,  much better than writing alone  & amp ;  better standard  # acwri
-1	New series of blog posts about Public Geographies featuring  @ DrHG  @ Profiainstewart  @ citizenjoesmith  @ DanRavenEllison 
-1	 @ KMcCarthyWoolf Meant although  -  not already ! 
-1	A different day ,  a different library ! 
-1	 @ CorkGeog My pleasure ! 
-1	 @ GeographyGreg I do at least recycle mine ,  trying to hide the evidence ! 
-1	 @ AllanWatson1  @ raulpacheco Is that because you have kids or because you are a geographer ? 
-1	 @ jeckythump  @ AmyJones _ Cymru I dont think I will be able to make it this year ,  still travelling back from AAG .  Maybe a poster though ! 
-1	 @ AndreaTucker3 working thanks . Having a good day ? 
-1	 @ jeckythump  @ RichardScriven  @ psimpy Just something a bit more fun to write .  Like a go along could easily become walkie talkie . 
-1	Appears to be a lot of A references in my bibliography .  Coincidence ?  Or am I a lazy alphabetical - order reader ? 
-1	 @ DrHG  @ janeyb222 Ive been gradually setting my alarm earlier over the last week in preparation ! 
-1	 @ Oldmanmackie Ive only sworn twice .  Lets hope I fuck it up before Christmas ! 
-1	My New Years Resolutions 
-1	 @ JamesManthorp Whenever mate ,  I am in all day .  Although my signal is pretty crap so skype may be easier ?  ! 
-1	 @ CorkGeog Love it . 
-1	 @ KMcCarthyWoolf I wouldnt be  -  just the reference list at the end of an essay .  Already the essay isnt written yet ! 
-1	 @ olimould Haha ,  I dont blame you  -  sounds like sabotage to me ! 
-1	 @ jeckythump  @ RichardScriven perhaps ,  although that would more be mobile ethnography rather than mobile video ethnography
-1	 # MyHEday is being spent trying to organise the messiness of my thoughts into some sort of logical and coherent argument . 
-1	My new blog post is about my New Years Resolutions 
-1	Everyday I come across papers I wish I had written or was planning on writing at some point  # LoveHE  # phdchat  # ECRchat  # acwri
-1	 @ CorkGeog Also ,  that deadline is very loose ,  Anna has no clue about it  -  just an arbitrary date I chose to try and focus myself ! 
-1	 @ sarahthesheepu yes it is ,  especially the academic world ! 
-1	A day of planning for me  -  attempting to get the organise myself up till the start of my PhD in Sept  # MyHEday

-1	 @ AskHalifaxBank ive received a call to verify that I made an online payment  ( which was blocked )   -  will it then complete the transaction ?

-1	First Christmas card of the season courtesy of  @ SuzanneCurrie1 .  Many thanks indeed !
