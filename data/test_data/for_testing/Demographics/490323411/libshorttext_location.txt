40	Actual quote from  @ Jimmyp113 :   " Im struggling to think of anybody cooler than Chris Evans right now "  . 
40	Heres the latest cool bloke from  @ Jimmyp113 :  Cliff Richard . 
40	OK ,  so according to  @ Jimmyp113 Chris Evans is also cooler than Jenson Button .  God help me . 
40	 @ mrleroymc sadly no I didnt compete ,  not good enough Im afraid .  Maybe next year ?   # probablynot . 
40	Settle an argument with me here .   @ Jimmyp113 thinks Chris Evans is the coolest person in the country .  Apparently being a radio 2 DJ is cool .
