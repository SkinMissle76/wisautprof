16	Such a great group on  # GH today .  I feel like I havent seen Monica ,  Tracy and AJ in ages though . 
16	 @ valentinifrank Super excited to see  # GreysAnatomy Chandra Wilson on  # GH !  !  ! 
16	Wonder if  # THECLOSER Brenda  ( Kyra Sedgwick )  will appear in next  # MAJORCRIMES ep but if so ,  why wouldnt they promote it  ( i . e .  for ratings )  ? 
16	AVA VS .  CARLY !  More of that ,  please !   # GH
16	Carly needs to propel a storyline already .  The Roger / Carly pairing is becoming boring quickly ,  and its been her s / l for over a year .   # GH
16	Considering we all know Heather Webber survived ,  I dont like being teased about her return .   # GH
16	 @ midnighter99 Thanks John !  Have a wonderful weekend !  !   :  ) 
16	Officially the last day of  # SoapNet .  .  .   # GH  # DAYS . 
16	Just saw the  # SVU episode when Agent Dana Lewis gets arrested .  .  .  such great acting from Marcia ,  but this means no more guest appearances  :  ( 
16	The character of Obrecht is amazing .  Ive never adored a new ,  non - vet character this much .  On par w / beloved vets .  Brilliant .   # GH  # SoapNet
16	I think Im gonna see  # AugustOsageCounty .  Theres nothing like a good ol gloomy ,  cynical drama . 
16	 @ brianmcandrew Well ,  like Ive said before -  trustable source said ABC wants em back .  Dont know anything more +  lawsuit complicates things . 
16	 @ brianmcandrew No word on form / capacity .  But I doubt theyd waste a dime on a wrap up ,  as opposed to a continuation which could bring in  $  . 
16	 @ JoeyJoeHo Thank you !   :  ) 
16	 @ gwynnega  Please Sign this petition to get TVGN to pick up the re - airings of GH and DOOL 
16	 @ SpinsVixenella  @ JoeyJoeHo Please sign petition to get TVGN to pick up the re - airings of GH and DOOL :  
16	 @ TVBUFF85 Like this idea ! 
16	 @ ABC ,  viewers still want  # OLTL and  # AMC back on the air !  !   " Katie Couric Talk Show Officially Canceled "  
16	 # KATIE has officially been canceled .   @ vickiabc123 Please consider bringing back  @ onelifetolive and  @ allmychildren  # OLTL  # AMC !  Miss them !  ! 
16	OMG !  CHANDRA WILSON  ( Bailey )  from  # GreysAnatomy will appear on  # GH in January !  !  !  !  !  !  Adore her !  And shes a known soap fan !  So excited ! 
16	On season 13 of  # SVU ,  but I read news .  Aint the same w / o Stabler ;  Cant imagine w / o Munch  & amp ;  Cragen ;  Cabot  & amp ;  Novak are only ADAs I like . 
16	 @ SaveOurSuds  @ OdieLisa Yes he does ! 
16	 @ SaveOurSuds  @ OdieLisa Probably too sad to talk about  +  the lawsuit .  Dont remember seeing anyone from online versions of AMC  +  OLTL . 
16	 @ SaveOurSuds  @ OdieLisa Except Michael Lowry  ( Ross )  but his character wasnt that important . 
16	 @ OdieLisa I meant though that I wanted to hear more about the day they  # OLTL  # AMC got cancellation news ,   & amp ;  the greed behind it . 
16	 @ OdieLisa True  ( except Michael Lowry but Ross wasnt an important character )  .  I would have liked to see Erika Slezak  +  Robin Strasser . 
16	 @ carlivatiron LOL !  !  It was a pretend bullet !  !  ! 
16	Other than calling  # OLTL  # AMC revivals failures ,   # WHOSHOTTHEDAYTIMESOAP was good .  Would have liked more screen time about  # OLTL  & amp ;   # AMC . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Ya she does give quite a bit of commentary I see .  But the images are pre - PP  ( ABC era )  so it feels outdated ,  but it isnt . 
16	 @ OdieLisa It would have been totally cool if they didnt include the bit about OLTL  & amp ;  AMC failing  ( online )  . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Shucks .  Sad . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Was PPs revival of OLTL  & amp ;  AMC included ?  Im about halfway through now . 
16	 " WHO SHOT THE DAYTIME SOAP "  airs tonight on  @ TVGN !  Not to be missed ,  soap fans !   # OLTL  # AMC  # GH  # YR  # BB  # DAYS  # GL  # ATWT
16	 @ gapboy  @ myerinmama  @ jadedlou  @ qsteph  @ AngelaVenezia Ron C has stated that the rumor is false . 
16	 @ brianmcandrew Ron C says rumor is false . 
16	Oy gevalt .  .  .  RT :   " Soap Alum Arrested "  
16	 @ brianmcandrew To that end ,  hes actually the perfect age !  !  Perfect actor for the role .  Helena is his step mom ,  so he shouldnt be same age . 
16	 @ brianmcandrew I understand ur point .  Just looked up VIs age :  woulda guessed RH  & amp ;  him same age ,  but RH is 45 and VI is 54 !  ! 
16	 @ brianmcandrew I believe I read somewhere that officially Valentine Cassadine would appear in early 2014 .  VI Is RUMORED to play him . 
16	Rumor has it Vincent Irizarry  (  # AMC )  joined cast of  # GH as Valentine Cassadine .  If true ,  WOW !  So much daytime royalty on GH !  !  !  Best cast !  ! 
16	 # WHOSHOTTHEDAYTIMESOAP looks SO interesting .  I cant wait to watch !  So glad  @ TVGN has become invested in this timeless genre ! 
16	Whatever twists ,  whatever turns come on  # GreysAnatomy ,  have pity on my distressed heart  & amp ;  repair Meredith / Christina ,  please  @ shondarhimes ! 
16	Now in addition to Richard Belzer exiting  # SVU ,  Dann Florek is leaving too ?  !  Wow .  Tis the end of an era at  # SVU .   # Sad . 
16	Always a class act !  I hope OLTL returns one day .  .  . to TV .  .  on ABC .  " Ms .  Slezaks holiday Message to fans "   # OLTL  # AMC :  
16	 # GH  # SoapNet  @ carlivatiron Oh no !  !  Heather Webber is dead ?  Heartbroken .  Shes one of my favorites on the show !  SO entertaining . 
16	 # GreysAnatomy How much longer do the writers plan to dig the Meredith / Christina relationship into a hole ?   .  .  . 
16	I always love it when the ghost of Georgie appears !   # GH  # SoapNet
16	 # RIPNelsonMandela
16	The  # Kirstie pilot was a bit rocky ,  but the 2nd episode was very good !    # TVLAND
16	I see a lot of  # Seinfelds Kramer in  # Kirsties Frank ,  and Im loving it !  Michael Richards is brilliant . 
16	Kirsties character on  # TVLAND  # Kirstie reminds me of Victoria Chase on  # HotInCleveland in some ways . 
16	LOL at Lucy fawning over Robin .  Lucy always cracks me up .   # GH  # SOAPNET
16	Its still very weird to see the promos for  # Dallas without Larry Hagman . 
16	CBS Entertainment SR .  VP Daytime Angelica McDaniel :  “Soaps Are Bigger Than Game Shows Or Talk Shows In Daytime ! ” 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Dont know if its fair to say they wouldnt have returned to TV  ( had PP not revived em )  .  Theres no way 2 know . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Right ,  I remember that .  But had I known it would air on OWN ,  wouldnt have watched online . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Well ,  again -  it wasnt my genius idea .  I think they belong on TV ,  1st airing ,  period .   ( And available online )  . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Vivid memory if it being 3 weeks later  ( attempt 1 )  .  Attempt 2 ,  nobody knew until they announced it months later . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Originally  ( attempt 1 )  ,  were gonna re - air 3 weeks after online .  Attempt 2 :  Months later !  Big difference . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa  .  .  . that news only came in the summer  ( OWN )  ,  after I already watched online  ( would have preferred not to )  . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Believe me ,  I looked EVERYWHERE for any remnant of hope that they might air on TV simultaneously w / internet .  .  . 
16	LOL ,   @ OdieLisa !   @ soapwikijohn .   Thats possible ! 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa That was in their first attempt -  they made it clear .  Second time around ,  not so much . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Call me crazy ,  but its my understanding that they said  " forget TV "  .  They revived the soaps solely for experiment . 
16	 @ OdieLisa  @ soapwikijohn I watch soaps pretty strictly on TV .  Other shows :  approx .  60 %  on TV ,  40 %  online . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa  .  .  . you cant tell the audience how they want to watch ,  they know . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa I understand that .  I think I was one of those initially ,  but I think producers should listen to consumers lol .  .  . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa And pretty quickly it became tune in next week rather than tomorrow lol .  I also really disliked watching online . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa I watched MERELY out of loyalty .  I had to watch YT clips of ABCs OLTL / AMC just to remember why I loved em . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa so then in ur opinion what was wrong with HULU / PPs version of the shows ?  They failed miserably IMO . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa I wouldnt dare say that .  Theyre doing great .  Traditional soap operas are SO different though ,  in EVERY way . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa I wish there was some semblance of promotion done for OWN re - airings .  Only the ppl who viewed online knew about it . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Promotion is another area in which they failed .  But I still dont believe ppl would have flocked to the internet . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa I respect ur opinion ,  but thats my opinion .  PP didnt do any of it right :  not the medium ,  the format ,  or stories . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Simply put ,  PP doesnt know how to produce soaps .  TOLN was their  # 1 concern ;  traditional soaps belong on TV now . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa In retrospect ,  I have to agree .  I loved ABCs open ended endings .  I hated what PP did . 
16	Realistically ,  the best thing that can happen is ABC converts  # OLTL  # AMC to half hour shows ala  # BB .  Maybe 1 day ,  extend to 1 hr . 
16	 @ soapwikijohn  @ OdieLisa Then why not create brand new shows / why pay for the rights to history  & amp ;  characters ?  I love  # OLTL especially  & amp ;   # AMC . 
16	Re :  Why isnt everyone running to Robin - at least they look surprised to see her ,   # GH ,  unlike when ppl saw TSJ Victor alive on PPs  # OLTL . 
16	And to everyone upset about Robin not interrupting the wedding ,  it was a selfless act on Robins part .  It appeared Patrick moved on .   # GH
16	 # GH The scene when Emma discovers ,   " mommy ,  "  Robin .  .  . gut - wrenching .  The scene was reminiscent of Robin running to Anna .  FV  & amp ;  RC are the best . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Thats great !  Thnx for sending that over .  Glad to see theres a reliable source for that rumor . 
16	Theres a rumor on fb that FV is telling RC to write material for through 2015 ,  suggesting GH may be renewed through 2015 .  I hope so . 
16	And .  .  .  it looks like  # TheGoodWife is going on hiatus ,  probably until January 2014 .  Might have been wise to give a preview though . 
16	Just saw last nights  # THEGOODWIFE ,  the 100th episode .  Absolutely stunning !  The show is really on fire this season ,  its remarkable . 
16	RIP Paul Walker .  So tragic . 
16	 @ TVGN  @ SoapUncensored Love that B & amp ; B will re - air on TVGN !  And this is a lovely portrait ! 
16	 @ DaysAddict Awesome !  TY .  Ill definitely put it on my list of TV shows to watch ! 
16	 @ DaysAddict Is  " Raising Hope "  good ?  Never saw it ,  but considering it .  Cloris Leachman is absolutely hilarious -  such a fan of hers . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Celebs of Hollywood go nuts getting work done .  I look at Slezak  (  & amp ;  other soap actors )  and respect every line on her face . 
16	 @ OdieLisa  .  .  . soap actors is because they tend to age gracefully  ( of course there are exceptions who get work done .  .  .  JZ )  .  .  . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Disagree re :  KMc .  But its appalling that anyone would write that to her .  One of the many ,  many reasons I think highly of .  .  . 
16	Celine Dion has NOT passed away .  She is alive  & amp ;  well ,  thank goodness .  People need to stop coming up with these appalling hoaxes .   # CelineDion
16	 @ Lerrikjay34 Its a hoax . 
16	Remember the last  # OLTL Thanksgiving ep ?  Was so beautifully done .  Matthew narrated ,  and he  " died for the holiday weekend cliffhanger . 
16	 @ OdieLisa KMc as in Kimberly  ( Robin )  ?  She looks healthy  & amp ;  real .  IMO she still looks 20 !  JZ looks like she had work done / went so wrong . 
16	I wish  @ TVGN would acquire rights for cable re - airings of  # GH and  # Days ! 
16	The moment when Anna turns and sees Robin is alive .  .  .   :  )   # GH  # SoapNet
16	 @ OdieLisa Wow .  If thats how it ends ,  so cold .  Feel bad for Maxie . 
16	 @ allisgoodie How I miss Stars Hollow !  Gilmore Girls was such a great show ! 
16	When this  # GH storyline is over ,  Im gonna miss Faison  & amp ;  Obrecht so much .  I hope they can pull a Heather and keep coming back .   # SoapNet . 
16	According to RS  (  # OLTL )  ,  theres a SAG - AFTRA conference call today re :   # OLTL  # AMC .  I wonder what thats about at this point . 
16	TVGuide Net .   @ TVGN has picked up cable re - airings of Bold  & amp ;  the Beautiful  # BB in addition to  # YR !  I wish theyd pick up  # GH and  # Days too ! 
16	And its the browser .  .  .  Anyone having trouble checking in w /  @ Getglue -  -  try switching browsers .  Worked for me . 
16	Wow !  Good luck .  A lot to live up to .  Such a classic .  ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ Sequel in the Works  ( EXCLUSIVE )  
16	 @ mindBLOGgler Still merely a rumor .  And nobody knows who shes rumored to play .  Wouldnt it be funny if she raised Ava  # OLTL  # GH
16	OMG .  Rumor has it Kim Zimmer has joined the cast of  # GH ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  I think they might just have the most amazing cast !  !  I hope its true !  ! 
16	 @ OdieLisa I thought rights would be tied up in lawsuit for yrs to come ,  until I heard PP missed payments .  Well see .  Should be interesting . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Enlightening re :  PPs uphill battle .  That being said ,  I miss my soaps in their recognizable form .  Rooting for ABC to get rights . 
16	William Shatner might appear on  # GH .  If he will agree to it .  Thats pretty freaking cool . 
16	 @ midnighter99 Thank you ,  John !   :  )   Have an awesome weekend ! 
16	 # SVU is so intelligently written that other crimes shows I watch are starting to seem simple and one dimensional .  Amidst season 6 now ! 
16	 @ OdieLisa His sources are trustworthy  ( of course ,  doesnt always pan out ,  but still trustworthy )  .  He is 100 %  trustworthy too . 
16	One way or another ,   # OLTL  # AMC will be back .  I believe that .  Were canceled in 2011 .  Approaching 2014 (  !  )   & amp ;  entities still fighting over em ! 
16	Good things come in threes    # AMC  # OLTL  # GH    @ ABCNetwork  # BRINGBACKAMCOLTLPLEASE   # IWillWatch
16	I do believe ABC sabotaged them several ways ,  but PP are laying it on a bit thick . 
16	I must say Im getting a kick out of some of your tweets re :   # OLTL  # AMC  # PP .  When times are tough ,  laughter is a lifeline .  .  . 
16	 @ delainey _ j Sent you a DM . 
16	 # Chewonthis  # AMC  & amp ;   # OLTL fans are still here and can be yours .  .  .   if the price is right ,   # BRINGBACKAMCOLTLPLEASE  @ ABCNetwork
16	TV news reported  # AMC cancellation  ( again )   # ABC  @ ABC PLEASE bring back  # OLTL  # AMC !  !  !   @ vickiabc123
16	 # OLTL  # AMC Wow .  OK then .  .  .  .  
16	 @ OdieLisa Yep ,  ABC considered it ,  probably contacted Dana .  Sounds like she didnt want to return .  
16	Well ,  Dana Delany tweeted  # BodyOfProof wont be resurrected .  .  .  .  its been a great few weeks so far .  .  .  not . 
16	 @ OdieLisa Or this could be my oh so wishful delusions talking out loud again ,  lol .  .  . 
16	 @ OdieLisa As crazy as this sounds  ( since AMC brought in better ratings )  ,  I wonder if OLTL has some strange chance at surviving somewhere .
