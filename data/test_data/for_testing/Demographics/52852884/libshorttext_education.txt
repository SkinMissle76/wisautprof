3	 @ Liam _ Reggie  @ Ben _ Trinder thanks Liam
3	There are two kinds of decisions .  1 )  those that are expensive to change ;  2 )  those that arent .  For 1 get info from ground .  Make 2 quickly . 
3	 @ LouisLancs Bayern agree to sign Lewandowski who will join in summer .  5 year contract .  Going to take some stopping now !

3	 @ JohnHarrison81 sorry John not seen enough of them to comment or know whats going on .  What would you do ? 
3	 @ LaurensJulien What do you think Klopps biggest strength is ?  Charisma ? 
3	 @ Tad690 apparently only 1 in 40 corners result in a goal in Champions League .  Unsure of stat for Premier League . 
3	 @ JohnyCEvans  @ crewealexlfc Glad to hear that John .  Best wishes to you and your team for 2014 . 
3	 @ Liam _ Reggie  @ Ben _ Trinder that was certainly the idea !  Sometimes we have to look outside the game to learn the things we need . 
3	Watching  @ BVB v Hertha .  Dortmunds back four unrecognisable .  Injuries have really hurt them .  Work to do for Klopp 2nd half of season . 
3	 @ domroma then draw someone  & amp ;  pass .  I dont understand why they pass to the midfield players when they  ( SG / FL )  are deeper than 1st def line

3	 @ jamesrharrison1 I just said exactly the same
3	Brilliant goal from Di Natale today .  Top draw .  Great finish by Danilo too ,  who I rate highly . 
3	Interested to hear  @ GNev2 criticism of zonal marking from corners .  Matter of opinion I guess ,  but zonal done well is very effective I think
3	Good luck to my beautiful wife  @ lizziebrophy starting a new adventure today x
