-0.48	 @ misterbrilliant Theres a few tat shops on the Walworth Road that might be a good bet . 
-0.48	 @ LewieP I suppose what Im arguing is that abandonware would be a good idea if it had defined limits . 
-0.48	 @ NotFaulty There are some people that look at what PA are doing and think about it and write excellent pieces on why it can harm .  .  .

-0.48	 @ LewieP Well ,  I dont think it should happen immediately but down the line perhaps it becomes more justified if a case can be made for why . 
-0.48	 @ iguanahat  @ CaptainToss I can fire over a backup file of my settings if it would help figure out the difference ? 
-0.48	 @ CaptainToss  @ iguanahat Ill throw in my hat for BeyondPod .  Only oddity is how it builds playlists but it doesnt kill it .

-0.48	 @ cs87 I was using the mobile banking app and my nose ordered a new PIN . 
-0.48	 @ GeekyJules  @ LewiePsMummy Ah ,  I knew I liked you for some reason .

-0.48	 @ NotFaulty Yeah thats a better example .  I am getting very weary of people uncritically going for them on every move they make . 
-0.48	 @ Lee _ Bradley Oh ,  really ?  Ive been sold on it being Wii U - style play in bed stuff . 
-0.48	 @ LewieP No .  Nobody has a right to play a videogame . 
-0.48	 @ cs87  @ andihero Make friends with children and give them cast offs
-0.48	Sherlock was exactly what I was hoping for ,  especially regarding how he faked his death .  The scoring was the only jarring thing . 
-0.48	 @ Sir _ Grinch No probs ,  thanks for looking ðŸ˜Š
-0.48	Knew I should have bought a Â£100 Vita when they were in HMV .  Oh well .

-0.48	 @ LewieP I humbly submit Matchstick Men . 
-0.48	 @ briannemd Let me know if it works ,  Im just kind of assuming .  I love it for US Netflix . 
-0.48	 @ munkeybeerd But the direct insult from him to me was fine ? 
-0.48	 @ NotFaulty No ,  I mean hes not defending PA .  Hes critical of the rabid anti - PA folk . 
-0.48	 @ LewieP I choose to take this tweet out of context . 
-0.48	 @ munkeybeerd Well ,  thanks ,  but Im happy to talk to them too if they did . 
-0.48	 @ NotFaulty Mm ,  and I think thats what David is doing here . 
-0.48	 @ cymrogav damn Im missing it because of my STUPID LOVING FAMILY
-0.48	For those wondering :  
-0.48	 @ catulla Oh hot dang ! 
-0.48	 @ Arndreth You want to change that hash tag to capitalise . 
-0.48	Registered a bunch of stuff on Club Nintendo and this case isnt available any more .  
-0.48	John Eric Bentley ,  professional Samuel L Jackson voice double :

-0.48	Wait ,  Nidhogg is coming out before Sportsfriends ,  what
-0.48	 @ andihero Even if he changes it back his wall will have a giant announcement saying he changed it and showing the image .

-0.48	 @ llamasoft _ ox That works if possessive ,  no ? 
-0.48	 @ Carachan1 Its probably about an hour to ours if you want to crash and dont get a better offer . 
-0.48	 @ standardman If you played AO on PS3 might I be to borrow ? 
-0.48	I think my new years resolution is going to be not to order anything from Just Eat . 
-0.48	 @ peterbcooper Yay ! 
-0.48	 @ LewieP Ah ,  forgot about that !  The 16GB cards are Â£25 right ?  Think its worth holding out still ? 
-0.48	 @ LewieP Youre assuming rights ownership is unimportant . 
-0.48	Oh god this isnt going to work its like next door to me
-0.48	Ill have to actually find the physical location of my favourite pizza place and make it worth it . 
-0.48	 @ SvendJoscelyne Remove the battery immediately .  Put them ,  separately ,  in a bag of uncooked rice for twelve hours to absorb moisture . 
-0.48	 @ botherer I dont believe Moffats fingerprints are on these two .  Youve got the last one to wait for for that delight . 
-0.48	Hey  @ corpsheffield how the hell do I unsubscribe from your newsletter ? 
-0.48	 @ LewieP That Wii description is art . 
-0.48	 @ ShawnElliott A definition ,  then ?  It seems that its a term that mocks effort . 
-0.48	I wonder how many people watched  # Sherlock and had a revelation that their phone could do caps lock after all . 
-0.48	 @ CaptainToss  @ lewiep I agree ,  but games arent cultural artifacts by default .  A broad brush approach isnt the answer . 
-0.48	 @ AaronDreadels  @ AH _ BrownMan  @ GeoffLRamsey Using component gets around that .  Unless Im wrong theyve captured from PS3 this way before ? 
-0.48	 @ LewieP  @ standardman Wow ,  that definitely says a thing . 
-0.48	 @ jennatar Two metres . 
-0.48	 @ CaptainToss I MIGHT .  Youll need to wait until mid week though . 
-0.48	 @ briannemd Oh no  :  ( 
-0.48	 @ sinisteragent That should have read soon . 
-0.48	 @ NotFaulty  .  .  . and there are a vast amount of others who have taken it on as a strange vendetta and look at everything through that lens . 
-0.48	Barely eaten today ,  so even banana flavoured confetti sounds appealing .  Clearly I need to solve that . 
-0.48	 @ standardman  @ LewieP Its actually impossible to buy anything from HMV online using a mobile device at the moment . 
-0.48	 @ NotFaulty No ,  it isnt . 
-0.48	 @ munkeybeerd  @ tyler _ bucslife What are you suggesting ? 
-0.48	 @ zach _ helger Why ? 
-0.48	 @ cs87 Exactly .  ðŸ˜ƒ
-0.48	 @ sinisteragent  .  .  . those emails and send them off to IFTTT ,  it fan send you a text as sppb as one arrives so you dont need to check it . 
-0.48	 @ ozmills  @ LewieP Perhaps after some time .  Theres a strange mix of copyright and art and you cant ignore one for the sake of the other . 
-0.48	HARPLY NEE YORF
-0.48	Is there a word for when you get used to using an emoticon and then you look at it on a different OS and it makes you look super creepy ? 
-0.48	 @ munkeybeerd Meh ,  even if he were ,  IMO thats reason to communicate .  Understand different perspectives ,  etc . 
-0.48	 @ AdamShawBiz Perhaps more so for the public who are more likely to be unaware of their rights . 
-0.48	 @ joedunn721 Well thats because youre a horrible racist . 
-0.48	 @ big _ classy What on earth ?  What kind of letter was it ? 
-0.48	 @ LewiePsMummy Two - factor authentication is the cause ,  if its the same problem as on the iPad .  Let me see if I can find the link I used . 
-0.48	Looking for a desktop - style phone that takes a SIM card for my grandma  -  anyone know a better deal than this ?  
-0.48	 @ sinisteragent Id recommend using IFTTT to text you when you receive that email with a filter . 
-0.48	The two hours were spent on 
-0.48	I only have six hours to annoy my American friends like this :  
-0.48	I dont know why ,  but I assumed the PS Vita used a nano SIM .  I was wrong ! 
-0.48	Turned on my computer for the first time after the Christmas break .  THANKS  @ Fnerk  @ weefz LOADS  : D
-0.48	 @ mikeBithell Internet might not endure ,  but I feel like online will . 
-0.48	 @ catulla I would love to see if Id pass that test . 
-0.48	 @ ThatDaveGuy And yet a testament to how well hes done with Sherlock ? 
-0.48	 @ beckyface  @ darleysam Oh no !  Im really sorry to hear that ,  he was lovely .  Hugs ! 
-0.48	 @ LewieP If there are any Vitas ,  grab me one . 
-0.48	 @ hookem9991 There is ,  it released last month .  
-0.48	 @ CaptainToss  @ lewiep Well it is a bit . 
-0.48	 @ Grabcocque Yeah . 
-0.48	 @ AmyTreacle You can get reverse scurvy ,  yeah .  Internet pirates often get it . 
-0.48	 @ bfod Well I wish I knew that before buying three Moves
-0.48	 @ CaptainToss If I do make it itll be for the afters .  Rather more miffed than Im letting on to my lovely family to avoid an argument . 
-0.48	 @ botherer I think I started worrying about this series when he missed the Tube car count .  At risk of being twee ,  seeing but not observing .
