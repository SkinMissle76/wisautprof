3	 @ LewiePsMummy Cheers . 
3	 @ misterbrilliant Theres a few tat shops on the Walworth Road that might be a good bet . 
3	 @ LewieP I suppose what Im arguing is that abandonware would be a good idea if it had defined limits .

3	Is there anyone that does DS Lets Plays ?  Im tempted to order a mod for my old DS to do some . 
3	 @ lavalampbamboo Yeah .  Theres some really interesting stuff with symbols that only appear at night on signs and rainbows and stuff . 
3	 @ munkeybeerd Im surprised you read mine as an insult . 
3	 @ Markatansky Mark !  Your use of Twitters reply function is commendable . 
3	 @ LewieP Im going to be using PS +  so Im the same .  The thing about the HMV deal was it came with 8GB too so it was Â£125 for 24GB .

3	 @ Fnerk I hope the stars dont expire before they put it back up !  It was up a week or so ago . 
3	 @ LewieP Well ,  I dont think it should happen immediately but down the line perhaps it becomes more justified if a case can be made for why . 
3	 @ iguanahat  @ CaptainToss I can fire over a backup file of my settings if it would help figure out the difference ? 
3	 @ CaptainToss  @ iguanahat Ill throw in my hat for BeyondPod .  Only oddity is how it builds playlists but it doesnt kill it .

3	 @ LewieP Oh Im not ,  theres just been a couple of really good deals recently .  The Tearaway bundle for Â£130 was one . 
3	 @ Pentadact  @ misterbrilliant When we were wee we were rather enamoured with Kevin ,  the Spaced Penguin :

3	 @ darleysam The younger the meat ,  the tastier .  Checks out . 
3	 @ Sir _ Grinch That would be excellent ,  thank you .

3	2014 lies ahead RT  @ everyword :  underachievement
3	 @ LewieP Im really sorry we havent been able to hang while Ive been up .  Please shout if youre down near me before you go off ? 
3	The Sound of Music really is an excellent film . 
3	Man ,  I just spent three hours reading about an unsolved GTA V Easter egg mystery .  Should probably sleep . 
3	 @ CMmoxie Bloody hell you are RACING ahead . 
3	 @ NotFaulty Yeah thats a better example .  I am getting very weary of people uncritically going for them on every move they make . 
3	 @ Lee _ Bradley Oh ,  really ?  Ive been sold on it being Wii U - style play in bed stuff . 
3	 @ LewieP No .  Nobody has a right to play a videogame . 
3	 @ cs87  @ andihero Make friends with children and give them cast offs
3	Sherlock was exactly what I was hoping for ,  especially regarding how he faked his death .  The scoring was the only jarring thing . 
3	 @ Sir _ Grinch No probs ,  thanks for looking ðŸ˜Š
3	Knew I should have bought a Â£100 Vita when they were in HMV .  Oh well . 
3	Via  @ catulla  -  heres part of the UK citizenship test .  
3	Girl you must be Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg because Im trying to use an obscure game to sound witty
3	 @ LewieP I humbly submit Matchstick Men . 
3	 @ briannemd Let me know if it works ,  Im just kind of assuming .  I love it for US Netflix . 
3	 @ munkeybeerd But the direct insult from him to me was fine ? 
3	 @ NotFaulty No ,  I mean hes not defending PA .  Hes critical of the rabid anti - PA folk . 
3	 @ LewieP I choose to take this tweet out of context . 
3	 @ munkeybeerd Well ,  thanks ,  but Im happy to talk to them too if they did . 
3	 @ NotFaulty Mm ,  and I think thats what David is doing here . 
3	 @ cymrogav damn Im missing it because of my STUPID LOVING FAMILY
3	For those wondering :  
3	 @ catulla Oh hot dang ! 
3	 @ Arndreth You want to change that hash tag to capitalise .

3	John Eric Bentley ,  professional Samuel L Jackson voice double :  
3	 @ failnaut  @ johanvinet Sounds like Bravely Default might be next .  Theres a chunky demo on the eShop . 
3	 @ LewiePsMummy Which app ? 
3	Wait ,  Nidhogg is coming out before Sportsfriends ,  what
3	 @ andihero Even if he changes it back his wall will have a giant announcement saying he changed it and showing the image . 
3	 @ ultrabrilliant I did .  Its bullshit ! 
3	 @ llamasoft _ ox That works if possessive ,  no ? 
3	 @ Carachan1 Its probably about an hour to ours if you want to crash and dont get a better offer . 
3	 @ standardman If you played AO on PS3 might I be to borrow ? 
3	I think my new years resolution is going to be not to order anything from Just Eat . 
3	 @ peterbcooper Yay ! 
3	 @ LewieP Ah ,  forgot about that !  The 16GB cards are Â£25 right ?  Think its worth holding out still ? 
3	 @ LewieP Youre assuming rights ownership is unimportant . 
3	Oh god this isnt going to work its like next door to me
3	Ill have to actually find the physical location of my favourite pizza place and make it worth it . 
3	 @ SvendJoscelyne Remove the battery immediately .  Put them ,  separately ,  in a bag of uncooked rice for twelve hours to absorb moisture . 
3	 @ botherer I dont believe Moffats fingerprints are on these two .  Youve got the last one to wait for for that delight . 
3	Hey  @ corpsheffield how the hell do I unsubscribe from your newsletter ? 
3	 @ LewieP That Wii description is art . 
3	 @ ShawnElliott A definition ,  then ?  It seems that its a term that mocks effort . 
3	I wonder how many people watched  # Sherlock and had a revelation that their phone could do caps lock after all . 
3	 @ CaptainToss  @ lewiep I agree ,  but games arent cultural artifacts by default .  A broad brush approach isnt the answer . 
3	 @ AaronDreadels  @ AH _ BrownMan  @ GeoffLRamsey Using component gets around that .  Unless Im wrong theyve captured from PS3 this way before ? 
3	 @ LewieP  @ standardman Wow ,  that definitely says a thing . 
3	 @ jennatar Two metres . 
3	 @ CaptainToss I MIGHT .  Youll need to wait until mid week though . 
3	 @ briannemd Oh no  :  ( 
3	 @ sinisteragent That should have read soon . 
3	 @ NotFaulty  .  .  . and there are a vast amount of others who have taken it on as a strange vendetta and look at everything through that lens . 
3	Barely eaten today ,  so even banana flavoured confetti sounds appealing .  Clearly I need to solve that . 
3	 @ standardman  @ LewieP Its actually impossible to buy anything from HMV online using a mobile device at the moment . 
3	 @ NotFaulty No ,  it isnt . 
3	 @ munkeybeerd  @ tyler _ bucslife What are you suggesting ? 
3	 @ zach _ helger Why ? 
3	 @ cs87 Exactly .  ðŸ˜ƒ
3	 @ sinisteragent  .  .  . those emails and send them off to IFTTT ,  it fan send you a text as sppb as one arrives so you dont need to check it . 
3	 @ ozmills  @ LewieP Perhaps after some time .  Theres a strange mix of copyright and art and you cant ignore one for the sake of the other . 
3	HARPLY NEE YORF
3	Is there a word for when you get used to using an emoticon and then you look at it on a different OS and it makes you look super creepy ? 
3	 @ munkeybeerd Meh ,  even if he were ,  IMO thats reason to communicate .  Understand different perspectives ,  etc . 
3	 @ AdamShawBiz Perhaps more so for the public who are more likely to be unaware of their rights . 
3	 @ joedunn721 Well thats because youre a horrible racist . 
3	 @ big _ classy What on earth ?  What kind of letter was it ? 
3	 @ LewiePsMummy Two - factor authentication is the cause ,  if its the same problem as on the iPad .  Let me see if I can find the link I used . 
3	Looking for a desktop - style phone that takes a SIM card for my grandma  -  anyone know a better deal than this ?  
3	 @ sinisteragent Id recommend using IFTTT to text you when you receive that email with a filter . 
3	The two hours were spent on 
3	I only have six hours to annoy my American friends like this :  
3	I dont know why ,  but I assumed the PS Vita used a nano SIM .  I was wrong ! 
3	Turned on my computer for the first time after the Christmas break .  THANKS  @ Fnerk  @ weefz LOADS  : D
3	 @ mikeBithell Internet might not endure ,  but I feel like online will . 
3	 @ catulla I would love to see if Id pass that test . 
3	 @ ThatDaveGuy And yet a testament to how well hes done with Sherlock ? 
3	 @ beckyface  @ darleysam Oh no !  Im really sorry to hear that ,  he was lovely .  Hugs ! 
3	 @ LewieP If there are any Vitas ,  grab me one . 
3	 @ hookem9991 There is ,  it released last month .  
3	 @ CaptainToss  @ lewiep Well it is a bit . 
3	 @ Grabcocque Yeah . 
3	 @ AmyTreacle You can get reverse scurvy ,  yeah .  Internet pirates often get it . 
3	 @ bfod Well I wish I knew that before buying three Moves
3	 @ CaptainToss If I do make it itll be for the afters .  Rather more miffed than Im letting on to my lovely family to avoid an argument . 
3	 @ botherer I think I started worrying about this series when he missed the Tube car count .  At risk of being twee ,  seeing but not observing .
