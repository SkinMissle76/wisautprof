17	 @ botherer Ah ,  my mistake . 
17	Whod have thought that John Watson was such an awful writer .  
17	 @ Pentadact  @ misterbrilliant Although that link isnt working .  This one might !  
17	 @ Beavs Look ,  if you dont set yourself a realistic goal youll never achieve it . 
17	 @ ShawnElliott Whats a try - hard in this context ?  Ive always found that term repulsive . 
17	 @ AH _ BrownMan  @ GeoffLRamsey Every tragedy is an opportunity .  Perhaps to try out the PS3 version and Lets Play a rebuild . 
17	 @ LewiePsMummy The second part of this article should run you through it :  
17	 @ BenParfitt Hang on ,  what ?  Without context that it rather troubling . 
17	 @ LewiePsMummy Cheers . 
17	 @ misterbrilliant Theres a few tat shops on the Walworth Road that might be a good bet . 
17	 @ LewieP I suppose what Im arguing is that abandonware would be a good idea if it had defined limits . 
17	 @ NotFaulty There are some people that look at what PA are doing and think about it and write excellent pieces on why it can harm .  .  . 
17	 @ andihero  @ carla _ burns RED DEAD REDEMPTIONNNNN

17	 @ CaptainToss Bravely reducing his client pool by preventing potential clients from existing
17	 @ LewieP Grinch helped me out a lot when I was faffing with mine . 
17	 @ Lee _ Bradley Not just yet ,  but probably by the time the month is out . 
17	 @ big _ classy And why is that illegal ? 
17	 @ cymrogav First victory .  Eat it .  
17	 @ CMmoxie I so am .  All I have here is flat Coke and OH MY GOD I JUST REMEMBERED I HAVE SWEETS IN MY COAT
17	Just remembered the time I dropped my phone on my face and locked myself out of online banking for a week . 
17	Is there anyone that does DS Lets Plays ?  Im tempted to order a mod for my old DS to do some . 
17	 @ lavalampbamboo Yeah .  Theres some really interesting stuff with symbols that only appear at night on signs and rainbows and stuff . 
17	 @ munkeybeerd Im surprised you read mine as an insult . 
17	 @ Markatansky Mark !  Your use of Twitters reply function is commendable . 
17	 @ LewieP Im going to be using PS +  so Im the same .  The thing about the HMV deal was it came with 8GB too so it was Â£125 for 24GB . 
17	 @ LewieP  & lt ; 3
17	 @ ozmills Im guessing something in it prompted a TIL on Reddit . 
17	Aaaarrrrrggghhhh RT  @ craigslistlove :  Adorable Nerd Seeks Fertile Birthing Hips
17	 @ sinisteragent 
17	 @ Fnerk I hope the stars dont expire before they put it back up !  It was up a week or so ago . 
17	 @ LewieP Well ,  I dont think it should happen immediately but down the line perhaps it becomes more justified if a case can be made for why . 
17	 @ iguanahat  @ CaptainToss I can fire over a backup file of my settings if it would help figure out the difference ? 
17	 @ CaptainToss  @ iguanahat Ill throw in my hat for BeyondPod .  Only oddity is how it builds playlists but it doesnt kill it . 
17	 @ briannemd 
17	 @ Lee _ Bradley Ooh excellent ,  thatll be a good one for iPlayer if it makes its way on . 
17	 @ adamhess1 Ooh now thats brilliant .

17	 @ catulla oh no but I have been told I have to hate you for this by the tabloids
17	 @ Lee _ Bradley Oh I want one already  -  PS +  and PS4 Remote Play make it essential IMO . 
17	 @ big _ classy Oh ,  wow .  Well then . 
17	 @ evilbadman 
17	YAAAAAAAAAAAAA RT  @ zarawesome :  Nidhogg ,  winner of the 2011 IGF ,  to come out on Jan 14 2014 
17	 @ pinkcalculator Possibly ,  good shout . 
17	 @ cs87 Moriarty wasnt in half of them ,  itll be fine . 
17	 @ Nevskyp  @ pabosher I feel like mine strikes a balance .  I use it everywhere .  Plus  @ wtempleton ,   @ wdtempleton and  @ WillTempleton are taken . 
17	 @ LewieP Oh Im not ,  theres just been a couple of really good deals recently .  The Tearaway bundle for Â£130 was one . 
17	 @ Pentadact  @ misterbrilliant When we were wee we were rather enamoured with Kevin ,  the Spaced Penguin :  
17	 @ GAMEUxbridge If theres one with my name on it I sincerely hope it isnt sold . 
17	 @ darleysam The younger the meat ,  the tastier .  Checks out . 
17	 @ Sir _ Grinch That would be excellent ,  thank you . 
17	 @ Lee _ Bradley What have you been playing ? 
17	 @ cs87 I was using the mobile banking app and my nose ordered a new PIN . 
17	 @ GeekyJules  @ LewiePsMummy Ah ,  I knew I liked you for some reason . 
17	 @ darleysam  " As someone who hates something ,  please sign this document against hate .  " 
17	 @ tyler _ bucslife Im not religious . 
17	 @ CaptainToss I may not make it unfortunately .  Still in York . 
17	 @ iguanahat  @ CaptainToss Oh I dont have that issue .  I sacked off SmartPlay entirely and delved into the settings to customise it first day . 
17	2014 lies ahead RT  @ everyword :  underachievement
17	 @ LewieP Im really sorry we havent been able to hang while Ive been up .  Please shout if youre down near me before you go off ? 
17	The Sound of Music really is an excellent film . 
17	Man ,  I just spent three hours reading about an unsolved GTA V Easter egg mystery .  Should probably sleep . 
17	 @ CMmoxie Bloody hell you are RACING ahead . 
17	 @ NotFaulty Yeah thats a better example .  I am getting very weary of people uncritically going for them on every move they make . 
17	 @ Lee _ Bradley Oh ,  really ?  Ive been sold on it being Wii U - style play in bed stuff . 
17	 @ LewieP No .  Nobody has a right to play a videogame . 
17	 @ cs87  @ andihero Make friends with children and give them cast offs
17	Sherlock was exactly what I was hoping for ,  especially regarding how he faked his death .  The scoring was the only jarring thing . 
17	 @ Sir _ Grinch No probs ,  thanks for looking ðŸ˜Š
17	Knew I should have bought a Â£100 Vita when they were in HMV .  Oh well . 
17	Via  @ catulla  -  heres part of the UK citizenship test .  
17	Girl you must be Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg because Im trying to use an obscure game to sound witty
17	 @ LewieP I humbly submit Matchstick Men . 
17	 @ briannemd Let me know if it works ,  Im just kind of assuming .  I love it for US Netflix . 
17	 @ munkeybeerd But the direct insult from him to me was fine ? 
17	 @ NotFaulty No ,  I mean hes not defending PA .  Hes critical of the rabid anti - PA folk . 
17	 @ LewieP I choose to take this tweet out of context . 
17	 @ munkeybeerd Well ,  thanks ,  but Im happy to talk to them too if they did . 
17	 @ NotFaulty Mm ,  and I think thats what David is doing here . 
17	 @ cymrogav damn Im missing it because of my STUPID LOVING FAMILY
17	For those wondering :  
17	 @ catulla Oh hot dang ! 
17	 @ Arndreth You want to change that hash tag to capitalise . 
17	Registered a bunch of stuff on Club Nintendo and this case isnt available any more .  
17	John Eric Bentley ,  professional Samuel L Jackson voice double :  
17	 @ failnaut  @ johanvinet Sounds like Bravely Default might be next .  Theres a chunky demo on the eShop . 
17	 @ LewiePsMummy Which app ? 
17	Wait ,  Nidhogg is coming out before Sportsfriends ,  what
17	 @ andihero Even if he changes it back his wall will have a giant announcement saying he changed it and showing the image . 
17	 @ ultrabrilliant I did .  Its bullshit ! 
17	 @ llamasoft _ ox That works if possessive ,  no ? 
17	 @ Carachan1 Its probably about an hour to ours if you want to crash and dont get a better offer . 
17	 @ standardman If you played AO on PS3 might I be to borrow ? 
17	I think my new years resolution is going to be not to order anything from Just Eat . 
17	 @ peterbcooper Yay ! 
17	 @ LewieP Ah ,  forgot about that !  The 16GB cards are Â£25 right ?  Think its worth holding out still ? 
17	 @ LewieP Youre assuming rights ownership is unimportant . 
17	Oh god this isnt going to work its like next door to me
17	Ill have to actually find the physical location of my favourite pizza place and make it worth it . 
17	 @ SvendJoscelyne Remove the battery immediately .  Put them ,  separately ,  in a bag of uncooked rice for twelve hours to absorb moisture . 
17	 @ botherer I dont believe Moffats fingerprints are on these two .  Youve got the last one to wait for for that delight . 
17	Hey  @ corpsheffield how the hell do I unsubscribe from your newsletter ? 
17	 @ LewieP That Wii description is art . 
17	 @ ShawnElliott A definition ,  then ?  It seems that its a term that mocks effort . 
17	I wonder how many people watched  # Sherlock and had a revelation that their phone could do caps lock after all . 
17	 @ CaptainToss  @ lewiep I agree ,  but games arent cultural artifacts by default .  A broad brush approach isnt the answer . 
17	 @ AaronDreadels  @ AH _ BrownMan  @ GeoffLRamsey Using component gets around that .  Unless Im wrong theyve captured from PS3 this way before ? 
17	 @ LewieP  @ standardman Wow ,  that definitely says a thing . 
17	 @ jennatar Two metres . 
17	 @ CaptainToss I MIGHT .  Youll need to wait until mid week though . 
17	 @ briannemd Oh no  :  ( 
17	 @ sinisteragent That should have read soon . 
17	 @ NotFaulty  .  .  . and there are a vast amount of others who have taken it on as a strange vendetta and look at everything through that lens . 
17	Barely eaten today ,  so even banana flavoured confetti sounds appealing .  Clearly I need to solve that . 
17	 @ standardman  @ LewieP Its actually impossible to buy anything from HMV online using a mobile device at the moment . 
17	 @ NotFaulty No ,  it isnt . 
17	 @ munkeybeerd  @ tyler _ bucslife What are you suggesting ? 
17	 @ zach _ helger Why ? 
17	 @ cs87 Exactly .  ðŸ˜ƒ
17	 @ sinisteragent  .  .  . those emails and send them off to IFTTT ,  it fan send you a text as sppb as one arrives so you dont need to check it . 
17	 @ ozmills  @ LewieP Perhaps after some time .  Theres a strange mix of copyright and art and you cant ignore one for the sake of the other . 
17	HARPLY NEE YORF
17	Is there a word for when you get used to using an emoticon and then you look at it on a different OS and it makes you look super creepy ? 
17	 @ munkeybeerd Meh ,  even if he were ,  IMO thats reason to communicate .  Understand different perspectives ,  etc . 
17	 @ AdamShawBiz Perhaps more so for the public who are more likely to be unaware of their rights . 
17	 @ joedunn721 Well thats because youre a horrible racist . 
17	 @ big _ classy What on earth ?  What kind of letter was it ? 
17	 @ LewiePsMummy Two - factor authentication is the cause ,  if its the same problem as on the iPad .  Let me see if I can find the link I used . 
17	Looking for a desktop - style phone that takes a SIM card for my grandma  -  anyone know a better deal than this ?  
17	 @ sinisteragent Id recommend using IFTTT to text you when you receive that email with a filter . 
17	The two hours were spent on 
17	I only have six hours to annoy my American friends like this :  
17	I dont know why ,  but I assumed the PS Vita used a nano SIM .  I was wrong ! 
17	Turned on my computer for the first time after the Christmas break .  THANKS  @ Fnerk  @ weefz LOADS  : D
17	 @ mikeBithell Internet might not endure ,  but I feel like online will . 
17	 @ catulla I would love to see if Id pass that test . 
17	 @ ThatDaveGuy And yet a testament to how well hes done with Sherlock ? 
17	 @ beckyface  @ darleysam Oh no !  Im really sorry to hear that ,  he was lovely .  Hugs ! 
17	 @ LewieP If there are any Vitas ,  grab me one . 
17	 @ hookem9991 There is ,  it released last month .  
17	 @ CaptainToss  @ lewiep Well it is a bit . 
17	 @ Grabcocque Yeah . 
17	 @ AmyTreacle You can get reverse scurvy ,  yeah .  Internet pirates often get it . 
17	 @ bfod Well I wish I knew that before buying three Moves
17	 @ CaptainToss If I do make it itll be for the afters .  Rather more miffed than Im letting on to my lovely family to avoid an argument . 
17	 @ botherer I think I started worrying about this series when he missed the Tube car count .  At risk of being twee ,  seeing but not observing .
