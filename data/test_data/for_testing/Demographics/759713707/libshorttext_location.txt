21	Working late nights will eventually kill me ,  I can already tell .  .  . 
21	So thats christmas finished ,  I was just starting to get the hang of wrapping presents as well
21	Attempting to walk to Ongar in the dark is not advisable
21	I could complain ,  but a lot of what I could moan about in life is very self - inflicted
21	Two crates of beer ,  two bottles of sourz ,  bottle of whiskey ,  bottle of baileys ,  no ID needed in tescos ,  whats the point of turning 18 ?  ?  ? 
21	Why do I always buy the hardest presents to wrap ?  ? 
21	Evening out with the  @ NathanTime _ 21 ,  BFMV ,  reckon Im gonna feel like Im back in year 10
21	There are only so many ways to entertain myself at work before I slowly enter a state of mild insanity
21	 @ MarilenaGant oprahhhh ,  dont forget we need Justin Timberlake -  cry me a river  ;  ) 
21	 @ paigegallagher1 you know it !  !  !  Not a party without Paige Gallagher
21	Last night was hilarious ,  but if I move my head the room spins now
21	That was an insane amount of work to do in one night ,  absolute filth
21	 @ oOALFIEOo123 still laughing at the state george was in
21	 @ oOALFIEOo123 yeah ,  you proud of me ? 
21	Ears are still ringing ,  still seem to be buzzing off my nut
21	 @ MillaneGrace erm yeah reckon so .  .  .  Popular consensus would probably agree
21	 @ MillaneGrace  * breathe
21	 @ heron _ lauren  # LHBYC its gonna be big

21	 @ ClarkDom  @ AmySimmonds1  @ Bexi _ McC  @ Emily _ Boswell  @ AlexSainsbury1  @ oOALFIEOo123  @ heron _ lauren such a good night last night
21	Bug zappers are a great source of entertainment
21	 @ MillaneGrace I did not scream ,  I had the situation under control
21	 @ MillaneGrace it was a stubborn wasp ,  I got rid of it with care and precision
21	That moment where you think you get it ,  but its wayyy too late
21	En Route back the UK ,  and god how Ive missed it
21	Should probably stop drinking these soon .  .  .  
21	An alien brain hemmorrage ,  an absolutely beautiful drink not gonna lie ,  found my new party cocktail
21	Alright now my birthdays over i can officially think about christmas ,  only 6 days away
21	 @ roneelavery  @ AmySimmonds1 well just have to wait and see how it pans out  ;  ) 
21	 @ roneelavery  @ AmySimmonds1 I cant distract you from your maths when youre zone ,  you might get less than full marks
21	 @ roneelavery  @ AmySimmonds1 People have anticipated this moment for far too long for it to happen outside of form  ;  ) 
21	 @ roneelavery  @ AmySimmonds1 no i think im going to really eek it out  ;  )  have you got a lesson 2nd ? 
21	 @ roneelavery  @ AmySimmonds1 I have got santa to write me a few words to say at the grand opening of the present and he is powerful with words
21	 @ roneelavery  @ AmySimmonds1 It would be so much funnier if you didnt know it was from me ,  so excited about giving you your present tomorrow
21	 @ roneelavery however it will not start with i have a dream .  .  .    ( That should amuse  @ AmySimmonds1  ) 
21	 @ roneelavery you have to open it carefully and there is a whole explanation to go with it ,  if i get time ill write a formal speech
21	 @ AmySimmonds1wrapping it as we speak  ;  )   # funniestpresentever
21	Stalkers that are good at what they do .  .  . you barely see them nowadays
21	Michael buble needs to slap that man  # xfactor
21	Day of media .  .  .  I didnt even take media ,  now just sitting covered in fake blood 
21	Just another day of applying for jobs ,  im bored of this now ,  am I really this unemployable ?  ? 
21	I feel fucking ridiculous -  bring it on !  !   # lookinghot
21	Warped tour -  so many mosh pits  # aching
21	Warped tour tomorrow  : D  # fuckingbuzzing
21	Its too early for this shit ,  id forgotten this time even existed ! 
21	When you hear someone playing slenderman in another room in the house the temptation is too great not to burst through the door shouting
21	 @ roneelavery its going to have to happen  ; P
21	How i spent my halloween ,  it makes handing sweets out so much more entertaining  # ouch 
21	Off to see russell howards good news ,  for the third time  :  ) 
21	 @ paigegallagher1 they were fake emotions and you know it ,  the real hug could not be reproduced !  !  ! 
21	Its official i am a don at guess who  # imustbeagod
21	That was fucking fast 
21	Lovely afternoon drive down brands hatch  :  )  
21	Just got in from a great night at russell howards good news ,  four rows back from the stage with free tickets is not bad at all though
21	Cooking with jack daniels  # b - e - a - u - tiful
21	 @ paigegallagher1 indeed i did ,  and whats more is i almost know how to use it
21	 " I swear there are more stairs than there were yesterday "  a drunken quote i vow not to let my mum forget  # drunkenfamily
21	Walking home seems too mainstream .  .  . and so we skip casually down the A12 ,  with  @ joshchown  @ shane _ newtons and  @ TimBob _ 12  # YOLO
21	I should really learn how to use twitter ,  maybe tomorrow ?  ?
