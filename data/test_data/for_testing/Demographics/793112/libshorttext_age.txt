-0.14	 @ liveotherwise  @ r2uk By the way  @ adobe photoshop touch is a rather more capable mobile phone photo editor .  Its very good indeed and only £7
-0.14	 @ PinkOddy  @ FalmouthJade sorting I dont think iphone has a backlit scene mode .  You could try the hdr mode though .  Might work . 
-0.14	Just recorded an AWESOME episode of Love All Dads podcast with  @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs and  @ dotterel .  Will release it ASAP

-0.14	 @ FalmouthJade  @ pinkoddy Tip 2 .  Let your little one see your face ,  not the camera .  Theyll smile at you ,  not at a camera . 
-0.14	 @ liveotherwise  @ R2UK  @ SamsungMobileUK Sorry i missed this question .  Whats up with Photoshop ?  Can I help ? 
-0.14	 @ PinkOddy  @ falmouthjade The problem is that the difference between the brightest and darkest parts is too much for the camera to handle . 
-0.14	 @ petitmew Spare battery is essential IMO . 
-0.14	And I just broke my glasses .  This will add a fun extra challenge to the day . 
-0.14	 @ dadwhoblogs  @ diaryofthedad  @ onedad3girls Me too . 
-0.14	 @ DiaryOfTheDad  @ OneDad3Girls  @ dadwhoblogs or 8 . 30 ?  I can do either

-0.14	 @ Secret _ Father  @ diaryofthedad  @ onedad3girls  @ dadwhoblogs Youre kidding .  You were excellent .  Hope we can get you back soon ! 
-0.14	 @ petitmew Easiest is a flash bounced off the ceiling .  Or window light and high ISO .  Or a big aperture lens  -  50mm f / 1 . 8 rocks . 
-0.14	2 hours until my first free Webinar showing how Intensify Pro can be part of your photo editing workflow .  Join me !  
-0.14	 @ R2UK  @ kerryjeanlister I use Airmail .  The MacOS Mail app is OK but very limited .
