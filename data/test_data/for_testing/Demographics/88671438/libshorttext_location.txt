23	I think United should trade in Moyes for Steve McLaren .   # seriously
23	 @ trepanation  # spaceinvaders

23	Kinda miss having someone now and then .  I suppose .  Maybe . 
23	 @ hopej94 fit for forty
23	Cleverley was better without Carrick  -  now that hes back all he does is pass sideways to him instead of driving forward .   # bbcfootball
23	 @ ZeroMark26  @ BenWalke  @ iaincarnegie  @ geniusbarr does look interesting ,  will keep an eye on it .  .  .

23	Right ,  awake .  Tea ,  shower ,  last minute silly gifts and a fry up in town perhaps .  Lets christmas . 
23	Bit of  # Battlefield4 streaming ?  I think its only sensible !  
23	 @ StellaSundance I can try that  : P Im well ,  as are cats !  You ? 
23	 @ StellaSundance I suspect I textualised your face off
23	 @ ZoeQuinnzel there are still people every year whose cause of death is trousers .  Go figure
23	My first tentative steps in to the world of Eorzea .  .  . FFXIV :  A Realm Reborn  | 720p  | 30fps :  
23	I am a rubbish buoy ,  cant argue
23	 @ SillyRabbit669 I wish  :  ( 
23	 @ SillyRabbit669 bad throat  :  ( 
23	 @ SillyRabbit669 Sames
23	 @ mikihood  @ SportAnalysisUk  @ essexfootie with their history I really dont think Maidstone can be accused of being handed any advantages .  .  . 
23	 @ smerf _  huh ,  youre still alive !  I need to go on Twitter more .  .  . 
23	If I all achieve in life is someone missing me .  .  .  . well to me ,  thats a life well lived
23	Woke up and smiled this morning ,  wishes swam like fishes from my head .  .  . 
23	 @ Quinns108 finally followed after hours of the resistance at egxr .  I am twitter lazy .  Was reminded by seeing your mug on Brookers thing
23	 @ Carachan1 finally caught videogames changed the world .  Quite smashing
23	Fridays are nice 
23	Still constant sound bug crashing on Siege of Shanghai .  Beyond ridiculous by this point .   # BF4  # PC  @ Battlefield
23	Uggggh mornings
23	 @ TheLittleHelly some kids only ever around for the glory days .  Being crap for a while weeds them out which is a Good Thing
23	Managed to acquire a punctured tyre on the way to work .  Yay . 
23	Finally started on Arrow .  It has my interest .   @ Chris _ Toffer101
23	 @ cindyfoo welcome to the cold
23	 @ cindyfoo every time I look at the calendar three more weeks have happened ,  too busy ! 
23	 @ KavitaAhir I might set up a trapezoid network and see if anyone fancies that
23	Oh crap so Christmas is soon apparently ,  I thought it was still October ! 
23	Moyes needs to click the overload and get ball forward buttons .  We seem to be stuck on ultra defensive .   # FM14  # mufc
23	Moyes fearful frown hardly fills you with confidence ,  does it ? 
23	Its ok ,  Zaha is coming on .  .  .  .  . jesus wept . 
23	 @ jondahlsamba we might win that one
23	Fuck off Moyes ,  youve been found out
23	 @ LifeJunkie7 be in my life some more  : D
23	 @ LifeJunkie7 i missssss you ! 
23	 @ jondahlsamba twitch is probably more popular for gaming
23	Woken up feeling like my brain has poured out of ears overnight
23	 @ ZeroMark26  @ the _ spad the drones cant be any fucking worse
23	Wish  @ AmazonUK would stop using  @ YodelOnline  ,  they are completely and utterly fucking useless .  Rely heavily on incompetent agency drivers
23	About time  -  monthly DD for car tax .  Makes so much sense !  BBC News  -  Car tax disc to be axed after 93 years 
23	 @ BearHugger  @ ZeroMark26 didnt we already have that down here in the south ? 
23	 @ ZeroMark26  @ trepanation robbing fucking cunts
23	Time to give  # bf4 up ,  Ive peaked  @ Battlefield 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 I anticipate this excitedly .  Assuming that new spacey wacey one is on there ? 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 the scope of this article is narrowing by the minute ! 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 did you look at ashes cricket 2013 ? 
23	 @ BearHugger it was but only running a 550w psu ,  it was loading it up to full whack so causing crashes .  750w on the way ! 
23	 @ BearHugger also ,  does that mean you come with microtransactions ? 
23	 @ BearHugger my new PSU not arriving yet means no bf4 later  :  ( 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 should probably be top of the list ! 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 sim city
23	Really not in the mood for extra hours at work today
23	 @ Fluffy _ Fury No ,  but I do sometimes fail at milk
23	Just poured milk in to my tea with too much vigour and now it is too white .  DAY RUINED ,  BACK TO BED
23	Cant wait for work to settle down so that I have time for writing again
23	 @ A _ Mish _ A where you been for so long ?   :  ( 
23	Every month Amazon gives me a free 30 - day trial of Prime .  Why on earth does anyone actually pay for it ?  ! 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 first world problems eh
23	Time to play look at my steam list for half an hour and not end up playing anything after all
23	BF4 tonight anyone ?   @ trepanation  @ ZeroMark26  @ BearHugger  @ SteMarsh  @ Swift _ 712
23	 @ ZeroMark26 have found that its hard to get running at 60fps even on GTX770 ,  but forcing vsync and AA through the card has helped
23	 # Ac4 on PC is nice .  It has been worth the wait to delve in to your world ,   @ DarbyMcDevitt ! 
23	Old GPU taken apart ,  cleaned ,  thermal paste re - applied .  Feeling like a boss . 
23	I think facebook is dead ,  yay !   : D
23	I am Steam Santa
23	Would have liked to have seen  # Nani on the left instead of  # Welbeck ,  but thats a nice looking team . 
23	I still miss my sunshine girl more than I thought was possible .  Can only hope shes smiling down on… 
23	GTX 560ti going up for sale soon .  Will sell for £60 to friends / friends of friends ,  tends to be £80 - £100 on the ebay and whatnot .  Hit me up ! 
23	 @ SteMarsh  @ ZeroMark26 be there in a mo ,  you guys on the team speak ? 
23	 @ ZeroMark26  @ SteMarsh will be on in 15
23	So the  # GTX770 is a bit fucking amazing
23	 @ SteMarsh  @ Chris _ Toffer101  @ BearHugger will be about in a bit ,  with my sexy new GTX770
23	 @ Reecey _ Rawr92  @ jondahlsamba we should form a duo ,  I rap like a spastic
23	 @ amazon UK clearly has a strange definition of on schedule .  
23	 @ nataliecarter _  what was it saying ? 
23	 @ faye _ clark _ 18 brain too exhausted for better reply please come back later
23	 @ faye _ clark _ 18 what even
23	 @ BearHugger you say that ,  but its amazing the difference smooth frame rates will make ,  youll find it easier
23	 @ BearHugger thatll definitely help
23	Just ordered my  # GTX770 .  Excited is an understatement !  !   # power
23	Do you pose like a teapot and pout like a duck ?  Congratulations ,  youre a fucking idiot .  Go grow a personality . 
23	 @ TheRicass well ,  Master System II was awesome .  Mine still works
23	 @ MsMNilsson I dont have a game boy to try it on anymore though  :  ( 
23	 @ TheRicass here 
23	 @ TheRicass Good choice .  Did you see the rare prototype unearthed recently that included networking features ? 
23	 @ MsMNilsson I found my pokemon red cartridge the other day  : P
23	 @ TheRicass will be an upgrade from your Atari Jaguar though
23	 @ LewieP most people make the VAT included argument for UK prices but thats clearly a simple lie
23	 @ Fluffy _ Fury also just struck me that as Saville is dead ,  technically we are ALL more of a danger to kids than he is
23	 @ Fluffy _ Fury wasnt that already common knowledge ? 
23	 @ Fluffy _ Fury it poses an interesting paradox ;  how do you defy a God that you dont believe to exist ? 
23	 @ MsMNilsson first follower ,  go meeeee
23	 @ Battlefield PC  -  i5 - 2500k oc  @  4 . 6ghz ,  8gb ram ,  1gb Asus GTX 560ti .  Upgrading card to 770 next week ,  as current is weak . 
23	Why do none of the  # XboxOne adverts show in - game footage ?  Because they look no different to  # Xbox360 ?  Surely not .  .  . 
23	Siege of Shanghai is a crash happy map .   @ Battlefield
23	That was a bit good ,  wasnt it ?   # drwho Roll on Christmas .  .  . 
23	 @ SketchStone cant confirm but Ive heard its a no ,  as PS4 isnt backwards compatible in any regard
23	Last time I leave my ties on the back of the chair .  .  .  .   # cat  # instacat 
23	 @ BearHugger Ive never got to grips with it .  Not patient enough ! 
23	Seeing a lot more  # BF4 hx servers with sniper limits .  Good form ,  chaps !   # nosniper
23	 @ ZeroMark26 could be worse ,  could be youtube
23	 @ HFCL _ team is back together to finally play  # BF4 .  .  . until it crashes .  Again .  
23	My first tentative steps in to the world of Eorzea .  .  . FFXIV :  A Realm Reborn  | 720p  | 30fps :  
23	 @ LifeJunkie7 hmph  : P
23	 @ LifeJunkie7 warning shot ,  or just wanted my attention ?   : P
23	 @ LifeJunkie7 missed me
23	 @ Jokesound see ,  I quite liked it .  Frustrating and problematic but a decent enough shooter to divert a bit of time in to .  Looks nice too
23	 @ Jokesound like a controversy dowsing rod
23	 @ the _ spad oh ,  so funny in the same was as cancer then .  I get it now ! 
23	 @ Jokesound looks like the KSI thing is blowing up again .  NOW I know what you were talking about at GLHQBBQ13 ! 
23	 @ Totalbiscuit nice voice though ,  so win some lose some
23	It is utterly beyond belief how any sane person can think the  # KSI rape face is acceptable ,  let alone funny  =  /  what a knob . 
23	That  # KSI is a bit of a prick ,  isnt he ?  Oh wait ,  he mostly does FIFA videos .  Shouldnt it have been obvious ,  then ? 
23	 @ KSIOlajidebt you cant copyright claim everyone .  free speech ,  man
23	 @ Jam _ sponge already down  :  ( 
23	Recovering from football in style 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 been fine today weirdly !  Likely not on tonight ,  only just finished football training
23	We talk about heaven ,  we talk about Grace .  .  .   # sunshinegirl
23	 @ BearHugger  @ ZeroMark26 if it really were only me Id kick my PC ,  but its a widespread issue unfortunately  =  [ 
23	 @ BearHugger  @ ZeroMark26 might come to that but frankly it shouldnt have to .  sick of games shipping in a barely beta state at full price
23	 @ ZeroMark26 Not that strange ,  forums are full of people with crashing all over the place no matter their spec
23	 @ ZeroMark26 yeah ,  comfortably mid - range in the specs ,  60fps on a mix of med - high settings
23	 @ SteMarsh PEBKAC
23	 @ ZeroMark26 no ,  was crashing before that ,  but now I get a different kind of crash ,  and we all know that different  =  fun ! 
23	 @ ZeroMark26 aye ,  being silly really ,  just so fucked off that Ive paid for such a broken piece of crap
23	 @ ZeroMark26 frankly Im in such a fucked off mood now that I cant be enthusiastic about it .  As a newb will die ,  will rage ,  wont enjoy . 
23	Constant  # BF4 crashes AGAIN tonight .  This is getting beyond a joke .  Frankly it can go fuck itself . 
23	Blergh .  Experiment failed . 
23	Have decided to be a grown up and try this cawfee that people keep going on about .  I always knew it as not tea .  Will report back . 
23	Up and showered by half 6 ,  new record . 
23	Chris Smalling runs like a T - Rex
23	 @ LittleJuiceBox1 this was after I managed to fall over getting out of bed .  Mornings are evil
23	 @ LittleJuiceBox1 my 7am consisted of humbly ironing a shirt for 5 minutes before I realised I hadnt even plugged it in . 
23	 @ StellaSundance you with glasses is like omg melt my heart
23	 @ StellaSundance I like it ! 
23	 @ TimeStillExists as a 27 year old single person with several friends in the same boat ,  be assured that you are neither old or different  :  )
