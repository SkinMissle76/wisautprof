26	Could have done without a run this morning after a shocking night with the baby ,  but that attitude wont run me a marathon .  So here goes  # fb
26	So glad I had the foresight to lay all my running kit put ready last night .  Getting kitted up  ( quietly !  )  in the cold and dark is a pain . 
26	First week of marathon training :  done .  6 runs ,  28 miles  ( dogs done 20 )  ,  good mix of road ,  trail ,  cross country and bit of tempo work .   # fb
26	Ive just eaten a Muller Rice and feel a bit cheated because I couldnt lick the lid clean  ( Im in a room with 500 +  people )  .   # fb
26	 @ GroveGem  @ withamrunners it was ace ! 
26	The weird thing about running .  How can a slow 2 . 5 miles tonight feel really tough ,  yet 8 miles across muddy fields the other day felt great ? 
26	I think Im a little bit addicted to  # ukrunchat  & lt ; 3 What a community !  !  ! 
26	 @ mia79gbr yes ,  Im looking towards my next race one at a time  # ukrunchat   @  _ jen _ mo
26	 @ simonpj9 ha wishful thinking on my part .  Have a good run whatever you decide  :  ) 
26	 @ Splodz a fabulously motivating day thanks .  So much I want to do ,  but need some more team members to help me now  :  ) 
26	I know running in the dark and the cold can be a bore sometimes ,  but I saw a shooting star on tonights slow plod with the dog .  Wow .   # fb
26	 @ Paul _ A _ Allison yes ,  dates dont work for me sadly  :  / 
26	 @ jen _ f16 yay !  Hows training going ladies ?   # vmlm2014  @ gemmarathbone
26	 @ mrsbedders oh god ,  yes probably best to let her think it was a dream .  Hopefully it was ! 
26	Creating a dream board for your business  ( or personal )  goals can inspire you to work towards them on a daily basis  # kickstart
26	 @ captureasecond lol ,  to give us some energy ?   :  )  We definitely need it ! 
26	“ @ nylonruns :   @ shellmoby dry shampoo  -  its the only way”  & lt ;  Genius !  I never even thought of that  :  ) 
26	We are on a magical mystery tour of the Midlands by sat nav .  Ended up on the M6 Toll !  Lincolnshire ,  where are youuuuu ?   # fb
26	 @ FrankieBoy76 enjoy ,  Im doing a select few ,  and concentrating more on running with my club  @ withamrunners  # ukrunchat
26	 @ TubontheRun I am blown away .  Expected maybe ten or so to turn up ,  but what a great group of people all looking for inspiration ! 
26	 @ mikew30 how far is that Mike ?  Is it a cross country one ?  So much choice  .  .  . 
26	 @ mia79gbr yes ,  fitness is the bit Im most looking forward to .  Hoping itll improve my speed at shorter distances too  # ukrunchat  @  _ jen _ mo
26	Just checking in for what I hope will be some a fabulous motivational day .  Lots of business tweets today .  Standby .  
26	 @ Splodz sounds like a good plan .  Have you made it to  # parkrun yet ?  A great regular indicator of progress  # ukrunchat
26	Having to set the alarm for half six on a Sunday to get up and go to work .  Glad I dont have to do that very often ! 
26	“ @ SandieFarrow :   @ shellmoby  @ UKRunChat come and do silverstone half !  !  Xx”  & lt ;  I might do ,  will look into it later  :  ) 
26	 @ SpennyBoy88 yes ,  Twitter has a great running community .  I love all the mutual support . 
26	 @ MrMarmiteRuns I hope so .  I felt really confident tonight too  -  hope my love for running shone through to inspire them . 
26	 @ SusanSpence77 started on Sunday after 3 weeks out with injury / yucky germs .  Todays the first day Ive enjoyed it .  It hurts after a break
26	What it can feel like sometimes talking to non - runners  :  )  via  @ Bluejonnie 
26	 @ Tanya _ Janexx it is very addictive .  Could t do without it now . 
26	“ @ withamrunners :  Fab session tonight .  Welcomed lots of new ,  eager faces .  Long may they last  :  ) ”  & lt ;  Great start to the New Year ! 
26	Hi  # ukrunchat Cant stop tonight ,  but just thought Id say a quick hello .  Keep on running .  See you Weds when Im hosting with  @ mia79gbr
26	 @ mikew30 well its restarted on New Years Day because I couldnt get out on NYE ,  so at Day 3 again  :  )   # runstreak
26	 @ CeliaLacy enjoy .  One day at a time ,  and before you know it you wont want to do without it . 
26	 @ LincsGeek HE Lettings on Doddy Road :   " Dont you realise we have hundreds of properties ?  "  Er ,  and how is that my problem exactly  .  .  .  ? 
26	 @ Runr795 thanks .  Quite pleased ,  just shows I CAN do it if I set my mind to it  :  )   # vlm2014
26	 @ Chris _ wharton70 oops .  Oh well ,  more miles in the bank for you  :  )   # vmlm2014
26	It looks as though theres interest to start a new eight week Couch to 5k  @ withamrunners programme on Monday .  Witham St Hughs Co - op at 7 . 
26	 @ Splodz yuk ,  hopefully youll be better by next week and raring to go  :  ) 
26	Just caught a beautiful Clumber Park  # sunset dipping below the horizon this evening .  
26	 @ RockPaperLinc thank you !  You are a STAR !  x  @ Splodz
26	 @ CeliaLacy yours was a lovely elegant name .  Mine in my northern accent still haunts me :  Little Rosie writing a Christmas card  " To Duff "  .  .  . 
26	 @ RockPaperLinc hi ,  22nd ?  Please say yes  ( its the only one  @ Splodz can do ) 
26	 @ Splodz lol ,  yes admit Im still in PJs while the little one is emptying the contents of her toy box  :  )  Its the weekend soon  ;  ) 
26	 @ lauralongknit its such a simple thing to do .  Cut out from lifestyle magazines .  I already know what house I want to live in  # kickstart
26	 @ newarkparkrun certainly will !  See you there . 
26	 @ mrsbedders oh god ,  creepy  : O
26	 @ Splodz it was great fun .  Lots of mud .  And trying to negotiate ditches in the dark was interesting too  .  .  . 
26	 @ SusanSpence77 hi ,  I think excitement outweighs panic ,  just about  :  )  is training going ok ?   # ukrunchat
26	 @ GroveGem card tricks are clever .  I know how he does the red / black one .  No idea how he sticks them to the ceiling ! 
26	 @ runtoeatcake yay ,  hi  # vlm2014 teamie  : D  # ukrunchat
26	 @ Splodz absolutely ,  the opportunity to recruit and build my own empire  :  ) 
26	 @ MissH8712 thats what its all about ,  pleased youve found some inspiration .  Enjoy !   @ UKRunChat  # ukrunchat
26	 @ bigstace9 totally agree ,  Ive been reading up on sports nutrition and water loss is the biggest challenge to runners  @ MissH8712  @ UKRunChat
26	 @ simonpj9 yuk .  Ah well ,  at least you can feel smug for the rest if the evening now  :  ) 
26	 @ naominf But enjoy  :  ) 
26	 @ Splodz great ,  will look forward to reading it .  Yes ,  same again ?  Also have an offer on Buy 2 ,  get 3rd half price if youre interested . 
26	Darn .  Cant do Ashby 20 OR the Belvoir Challenge 15 as part of my  # vlm2014 training .  All Im left with are half marathons .  Boo  # ukrunchat
26	 @ MissH8712 15 miles is a great start !  Im surprised Ive managed to get out so much actually  # vlm2014
26	 @ Splodz thank you .  Hard work ahead but Im feeling very inspired  :  ) 
26	 @ gemmarathbone I found a lovely weather window between 7am and 9ish for a XC .  Look at this sunrise !   # ukrunchat 
26	 @ kjppod89 a pinboard in your kitchen would be effective ,  so you can see it every day .  Or perhaps a screensaver / background would work
26	 @ lauralongknit exactly ,  nobody ever became really successful through doing everything right .  Life is about learning from experience . 
26	 @ mikew30 thanks Mike .  Happy new year to you too  @ Runr795
26	 @ Splodz Surrounded by a great team ,  and heard many motivational speeches today  .  .  . WOW .  Beauty of working for yourself is there are no limits
26	 @ Splodz well done .  It all still counts towards the bigger picture  :  )   @ tara _ papworth
26	Jeanette Magnusson ,  Swedish network marketing guru ,  has just taken to the stage  # kickstart   
26	My challenge today is to find some good training races for the London marathon and get entered  # ukrunchat
26	 @ mikew30 congrats on your 100 club Parkrun Mike ,  and good time considering backwards !  !  ! 
26	 @ SusanSpence77 yes sometimes it can be harder not to overdo it .  Take it easy  # ukrunchat
26	 @ Tanya _ Janexx fab .  The feedback is already fantastic ,  now to keep momentum going .  Some have discovered an exercise high for the 1st time ! 
26	 @ GroveGem a magician never reveals her secrets  ;  ) 
26	 @ debshil1 thanks ,  I will .  Hubbys ran it before so Ive absorbed the amazing atmosphere .  Cant wait !  !   # ukrunchat
26	 @ GroveGem I dont think its a trick .  I think he is actually crazy enough to stick an ice pick in his hand .  Do it enough ,  you wont bleed
26	 @ simonpj9 prob go out later when im indoors gets up .   ( And hopefully the rains stopped .  ) 
26	Have realised that the hardest thing about attempting a  # runstreak  -  as a woman  -  is having to wash and style your hair every day ! 
26	 @ mia79gbr I know !  I was meant to do  @ chestermarathon last year but fell pregnant 2 months into training  # ukrunchat
26	 @ mrsbedders was she scared ?  Or matter of fact ?  My friends brother ,  when he was 4 or 5 used to regularly chat to a WW2 soldier in his room !  ! 
26	 @ mia79gbr thanks !  Shell be a year old by the time I do London .  Its gonna be an emotional day  # ukrunchat
26	 @ Paul _ A _ Allison sounds good ,  will definitely look into it . 
26	Shes talking about allergic erections .  I hope she means reactions !   ;  )   # kickstart
26	 @ bigstace9 Ive been experimenting with my own water intake this week and its already made a massive difference  @ MissH8712  @ UKRunChat
26	 @ Splodz Im pretty sure youre already more than capable .  Let me know if you want some moral support there one week  :  )   # parkrun
26	“ @ withamrunners :  Great session planned tonight folks .  See you at the Co - op at 7 ! ”  & lt ;  Looking forward to the first session of 2014 ! 
26	 @ Splodz lol its not just raining though ,  its cold and blustery out there .  Doing a great job of motivating you arent I  .  .  .   ;  ) 
26	 @ HaggisAdele wow ,  yes timing would be perfect  :  ) 
26	 @ MellieMelC wow ,  thats beautiful .   @ mel _ bucks
26	 @ LincsGeek think well probably end up doing the sane . 
26	Wow .  LOVED our new  @ waterbabies class today .  Nearly had a heart attack when the teacher threw A in the pool though !  
26	Just catching up with last nights David Blaine .  How exactly is sticking an ice pick through your hand magic ?  ?  Feel a bit queasy . 
26	 @ ChrisWardrope yes shes a little  ( almost )  toddling entertainer now .  Has me in fits of giggles every day . 
26	 @ mia79gbr fab ,  its going to be amazing !   # vlm2014  # ukrunchat
26	 @ Meemer24 yes but unreliable .  She slept until 7 this morning .  Id have been late ! 
26	 @ Splodz yes Im working all day tomorrow so might try to squeeze in a couple of miles when I get home ,  but if not I wont worry about it . 
26	 @ mikew30 ohhhh sounds good  ( especially the cake !  !  )  .  Right ,  time to ask my running club to be my teamies  .  .  . 
26	 @ BrazilianGunner thanks Rodrigo  :  ) 
26	 @ gemmarathbone felt very privileged to be out running to see the first sunrise of 2014 .  Thats why I adore running  # ukrunchat
26	 @ MissH8712 maybe you just need to build up strength in your legs .  Long run should be no more than about 30 %  of total weekly mileage
26	 @ Sara _ Running hi Sara ,  thanks for the follow ,  and thanks to  @ goodallsix for the rec  :  )  Hope youre having a great day x
26	 @ Splodz it has a shelf life of 5 years while its sealed ,  so yes its only perishable once opened .  Great ,  will drop off next week x
26	5 minutes people  # SherlockLives Sssshhh .   # fb
26	Been to  @ the _ lincsrunner today to ogle winter sports gear while Mr M had a gait analysis  =  new trainers  =  family  @ newarkparkrun tomoro .  Yay . 
26	 @ mikew30 have fun Mike ,  great achievement .  Loving the outfit  :  )   @ parkrunUK  @ colwickparkrun
26	Oh my God .  Next doors letting agents are an obstructive pain the backside .  I just want to mend my fence !  !  !  !   # fb
26	 @ jen _ f16 Ive kind of adapted the  @ runnersworlduk marathon plan but am throwing in my own sessions too  # ukrunchat  @ gemmarathbone
26	 @ CeliaLacy  :  )  I still get some of them yelling  " Dove !  !  !  !  "  at me around the village  .  .  . 
26	 @ UKRunChat 22 miles so far ,  and hoping to round it up to a nice 25 with a  # parkrun in the morning . 
26	Right .  Looks like my mileage today will be double that planned .  Didnt make Parkrun ,  10k run with the dog it is then ! 
26	 @ cookie19612 Snap !  Good effort  :  )   @ UKRunChat
26	 @ cookie19612 good stuff .  Just a wee  # parkrun for me with the family ,  and the neighbours .  Enjoy ! 
26	 @ Runr795 thanks John ,  really enjoyed it .  Headachy problem seems to have cleared up ,  I drank lots of water yesterday  +  today .  Happy new year
26	 @ GroveGem but absolutely could not do it without you and my trusty team of  @ withamrunners  :  ) 
26	 @ Splodz thanks .  Feeling quite pleased with that .  And funny enough ,  6 runs didnt feel like a chore . 
26	 @ Splodz of course you can .  At least with the office quiet you can get stuck in without any distractions  :  ) 
26	 @ RockPaperLinc 25th was looking like the only one we could all do .  What about Feb ? 
26	100 days until London .  My marathon dream is literally 100 days away from coming true .   # fb
26	 @ MissH8712 hi .  Its a great place to hang out .  Think my husbands missing me  .  .  .   # ukrunchat  @ UKRunChat
26	Believe that you can and you are half way there . 
26	Life is 10 %  what happens to you and 90 %  how you react to it  # positivethinking  # kickstart
26	 @ GroveGem or chewing the glass !  Mental . 
26	 @ BodyshotPT hi Im in Lincolnshire so sadly theyre a bit of a trek for me .  Thanks though  :  )   @ UKRunChat
26	 @ simonpj9 howd you get on ?  Bit fresh out there ! 
26	So far this week ,  have ran 20 miles .  And have still got another 2 days .  Pretty pleased with my first week back after injury  # ukrunchat
26	 @ MrMarmiteRuns thank you  :  ) 
26	 @ Splodz Dont think were going now either .  Babes been up since 3 and Dans got until quarter past to get out of bed if he wants to run  .  .  . 
26	 @ TriConnection youre welcome ,  nice to meet you  :  ) 
26	 @ Bluejonnie haha love it !   @ keelyr1997  @ kevint80  @ Red _ Runner _ Tam  @ TiptonHarriers
26	 @ newarktricky yuk ,  my trail run was pretty miserable too .  Hope to be back at  # parkrun next week . 
26	 @ HaggisAdele just Googled it ,  looks fab ! 
26	 @ naominf yuk yuk yuk .  I hate hills .  We have a hill session at next weeks run club .  Bleurgh . 
26	The plan was to do Parkrun as a family today but half the household is still in bed as a result of a 3am wake up call .  Snooze . 
26	 @ ChrisWardrope its a fab hangout ,  lots of support and chatter .  Enjoy .   ( PS Im co - hosting next Wednesday )   # ukrunchat
26	 @ nikki2777 thanks  :  ) 
26	 @  _ jen _ mo which ones are you thinking of doing Jenni ?   @ BodyshotPT  @ UKRunChat
26	 @ FrankieBoy76 hi ,  hows training going ?  Mine has literally just started on Sunday  # ukrunchat
26	 @ SpennyBoy88 oh good luck with your marathon too .  Thanks .  Yes ,  I think frequent running can only be beneficial for overall fitness . 
26	 @ Runr795 yes I am .  Also have to figure out when Mr M isnt away though so I have a babysitter  :  ) 
26	Trails are a bit muddy today  .  .  .  
26	Right .  Cup of tea then Im off to meet my beginners for our new Couch to 5k  # excited  # ukrunchat
26	People posting follower / unfollower stats .  I really dont care .  Also ,  you lot automatically posting from Facebook :  stop being lazy ! 
26	 @ MANDARINLEISURE thank you Martin ,  happy new year to you too ! 
26	Marketing coach head firmly screwed on today .   ( Im even missing my long run !  )  Today were focusing on a New Year  # kickstart
26	2014 will be my year where I not only fulfil my London Marathon dream but also where I achieve my business goals with hard work and focus . 
26	This lady is amazing .  Shes achieved a €4 . 5 million bonus through her hard work and focus .  I know its not all about money ,  but still ! 
26	 @ Splodz yep one step at a time ,  literally .  4 miles is a great achievement for a beginner .  Well done !   # ukrunchat
26	 @ cookie19612 oh dear ,  hope all are safe and things are back to normal soon . 
26	 @ simonpj9 just go .  Youll feel better .  In deliberating too ,  but know Ill have to peel myself off the sofa in a min . 
26	 @ gemmarathbone  @ jen _ f16 not heard of Hal Higdon ,  must Google him .  A marathon is a lifelong ambition of mine  :  ) 
26	 @ simonpj9 Ive got the baby ,  and dont know how to take the wheel off the running buggy to get it in the car .  Boo . 
26	 @ ericaspellman good luck Erica .  Enjoy ! 
26	 @ MrMarmiteRuns good stuff .  And good luck with that .  Or should I say viel Glück  @ WrexhamGroupRun
26	Today Ive treated myself to a new pair of running socks and some hi - vis running gloves .  I really know how to spoil myself  ;  )   # ukrunchat
26	 @ simonpj9 yep .  Lets go !  How far you doing ?  Mines a 30 min jog with a  ( currently )  sulky dog  :  ) 
26	When networking ,  inspire and connect with people .  People do business with people they like  # kickstart
26	Wow .  About 20 beginners came to our Couch to 5k tonight .  The challenge now :  to inspire them to keep going ! 
26	 @ cakevscales Thanks ,  feedbacks great already .  Some of them are buzzing .  Need to look after those who arent feeling that high yet tho too . 
26	Hi  # ukrunchat Its just hit home that its my first marathon THIS year !  Who else is doing London ?  Aaaargh .  Excited !   ( And panicking a bit .  ) 
26	 @ jonnya07 thank you  :  ) 
26	 @ SpennyBoy88 good luck .  Im trying for a 100 day  # runstreak up to  # vlm2014 but think it might be a bit ambitious  .  .  . 
26	 @  _ jen _ mo is it your first ?  Ill be raising money for  @ AtaxiaUK a charity very close to my heart .   # VLM2014  # ukrunchat
26	 @ Bluejonnie thank you ,  Im really excited  # vlm2014
26	 @ Chris _ wharton70 thanks !  One week down ,  14 more to smash !   # vlm2014
26	 @ yellowbellyLou yes Ive heard about the hills  ( plural )  .  Eek ,  itll strengthen my legs I guess .  Better get some hill training in !   # ukrunchat
26	 @ hucklecat123 hi .  Thanks for the follow back  :  ) 
26	 @ Emskibeach thanks .  1st week of marathon training ,  feeling motivated  :  ) 
26	I think the biggest challenge of training for this marathon is how to cope with Mini Mobys erratic nocturnal feeding patterns . 
26	 @ captain _ coaster another couple Ive never heard of ,  will have a look .  Thanks Neil .  My plan has me up to 18 miles by beginning of March  .  .  . 
26	 @ Bluejonnie oh ok thanks for the tip !   @ Paul _ A _ Allison
26	 @ simonpj9 going on my own means I can run longer anyway as cant get out tomorrow  -  working all day . 
26	 @ CeliaLacy good for you !  Another run for me this evening too  :  ) 
26	 @  _ jen _ mo  @ mia79gbr my hubby said he visualised crossing the finish line through all his training to get him through the tough days  :  ) 
26	 @ Paul _ A _ Allison ashby 20 sounds like a good distance .  Is that on or off - road ? 
26	 @ bigstace9 true .  Gels give me a stitch .  I swear by chocolate coffee beans and jelly babies  :  )   @ MissH8712  @ UKRunChat
26	 @ LincsGeek I know for a fact they havent even bothered to contact the landlord yet .  Its been nearly a month ! 
26	 @ kjppod89 good luck Kirsty ,  Im sure youll be brilliant !   @ mia79gbr  @  _ jen _ mo
26	 @ mikew30  @ houndkirk looks like great fun ! 
26	 @ amywamy999 Ive looked at that today .  Bit expensive , might look a bit closer to home . 
26	 @ MrsStow wasnt too bad here ,  started raining about ten mins after I got back . 
26	 @ bigstace9 I personally wouldnt worry about gels for ten miles ,  but water is key .  Make sure you drink enough before  @ MissH8712  @ UKRunChat
26	Just committed to a 6 : 30am run in the morning .  This is seriously out of character .  Marathon training must have addled my brain  # vlm2014
26	 @ Splodz we might do  @ newarkparkrun tomorrow .  Depends what kind of night we have  ;  ) 
26	 @ MissH8712 how far are you increasing each time ?  And how much other running are you doing during the week ?   # ukrunchat  @ UKRunChat
26	 @ SHARKYontherun thanks ,  yeh silverstone isnt that far ,  could make it into the mix  # vlm2014
26	 @ lauralongknit I quit my job in November to start my own business .  Hard graft ,  but am sure the results will be more than worth it .  Good luck
26	 @ simonpj9 Ive tried waking mine ,  given up now after a whiny  " I dont really want to gooo "  .  Might take the dog for a blast round woods later
26	My 2014 goals .  A 10k PB ,  Newton Fractions HM and  # VLM2014 Oh ,  and the small matter of organising our local  # sportrelief mile !   # ukrunchat
26	 @ ChloeRunsLondon yay ,  good luck !   ( Reminds me I must get my fundraising page started )  .   @  _ jen _ mo
