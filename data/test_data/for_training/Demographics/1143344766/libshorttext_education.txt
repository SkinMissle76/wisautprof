3	 @ wooblyball its an honor ,  Mr .  Ball  # totwarmystrong
3	Ouch .  Westbrook to have surgery on knee ,  out through all star break . 
3	Better than ACL but not good .  After reading a doctors analysis of Derrick Rose prior injury ,  makes sense he wanted to wait last year
3	 @ hoopshype FA Kenyon Martin will add a calming veteran presence to that locker room .  .  . 
3	 @ TasMelas sound advice .  Gotta get my Overdose in somehow . 
3	Too bad about gallinari but on the bright side  # nuggets fans :  youre stacked at the wing .  Big loss though .   # nba
3	 @ TasMelas fair point  & amp ;  he must be a bit tired after carrying an entire team on his back this season -  - I get tired carrying a load of laundry . 
3	The  @ nyknicks are getting worked so far .  Its not lack of effort ,  its poor strategy .  Literally letting Lillard tee off from 3 .   # blazers
3	These refs are blind .  Clippers have been playing with only one man on the court most of the 2nd half .   # Clippers  # cp3
3	Chris Paul just asked the ref to give antawn that technical .  CP3 asks ,  ref delivers . 
3	My  $  is on Pekovic getting 4 year backloaded offer from  # blazers to make it tough for  # timberwolves to keep Rubio / sign FAs .   # nba
3	chance Warriors or Cavs make offer instead of  # Blazers but  # twolves either bluffing or crazy threatening to match Pekovic offers  # pektopdx
3	 @ LeighEllis you probably got this  “ @ jcraw55 :   @ BillSimmons you mad ?   Lol”
3	 @ treykerby Andre Drummond in the starting lineup tonight .  Guess playing those bongo drums paid off ?   # TBJ  # thelittledrummondboy
3	Pretty great victory cry after a Blazer comeback .  “ @ eegabeeva88 :  GOONIES NEVER SAY DIE !  !  !   # GoodEnufForYouIsGoodEnough”  @ LeighEllis
3	 @ TasMelas I bet ,  looks like the circus came to Houston . 
3	Love Andre Miller for moves like that .  No such thing as travel with 30 secs left .   # wiley
3	Wes ,  CJ ,  Crabbe ,  Barton ,  Damian ,  Wright  ( 3 ,  can play 2 )  maybe EWilliams return .  Never though  # Blazers would have too much talent this year .  . 
3	Please keep doubling Aldridge ,  Coach Woodson .  Sincerely , All the  # Blazers perimeter shooters   # Knicks  # RipCity
3	 # TBJ that double lock on the Blazers being  " dead "  in the playoffs hurt almost as bad as last nights trouncing .   # keephopealive
3	 @ DWRIGHTWAY1 clears the way to trade Wesley Matthews w / o missing his 3pt .  His defense / grit is hard to surrender though but  $ 6 . 8m .  .   # blazers
3	 @ ChrisBHaynes is there way  # Blazers  trade for Asik given cap ?  Meyers for sure but trade seems impossible bc both have ltd cap space . 
3	Stotts should talk to  @ Dame _ Lillard on adjusting his game .  needs to shoot short jumpers  +  3s  & amp ;  drive when open .  Lillard will be much happier
3	 @ pdxtrailblazers  # AskDame who has been the toughest defender against you in the NBA ? 
3	 @ jeskeets  @ TasMelas Reggie Jackson says Westbrook is  " a dog "  .  One vote for canine .  
3	 @ MeyersLeonard11 half thru 3rd qtr u got mad when we let a 3 in .  After that u were 10x as active / aggressive  +  looked great .  Stay angry . 
3	Keep giving Josh Smith open 3s !   # blazers  # defense
3	Gasol ,  Iggy ,  Rose tonight after taking ,  Rondo ,  Westbrook ,  Kobe recently ,  I have to wonder why bball gods just take  exciting players ?   # nba
3	Aaaaaand  @ Dame _ Lillard is all clutch  # RipCity
3	 @ pinwheelempire it worked ,  it worked !  ! 
3	Law of unintended  # NBA consequences :  try 2 stop delays .  Leads 2 delays from players avoiding ball or failing  & amp ;  then team shoots slow tech .  .  . 
3	I have no idea how to guard Josh Smith with this lineup .  Why is this the one game that Smith decides to play post and not take long 2s  & amp ;  3s ? 
3	 @ LeighEllis didnt Batum say last year as a child he dreamed of one day playing in Minnesota ?  Who needs MSG when you have the Mecca in Minny ? 
3	Remember how mad  @ kevinlove was w /  FO last year ?  worse if Pekovic signs poison pill  & amp ;  Rubio gets his  $  in 15 / 16 and team cant lure FAs w  $ 
3	Good god Meyers Leonard just posterized .  .  . oh ,  that was andre miller underneath him ?  Still pretty sick .   # ripcity  # Blazers
3	 @ nbatv what if Dwight was just asking Handsome Chandler Parsons  " whats up ?  "   # TheStarters also would his 101 qs all be the same one ? 
3	 @ StartersMatt siren sample on the break has to stop ,  please .  2nd time driving home listening to the Starters  & amp ;  thought I got pulled over ! 
3	 @ wessywes2 just gotta say :  youve been incredible playing thru injuries and playing outta your mind .  As a longtime blazer fan ,  much thanks . 
3	my prediction for road trip  @ GuysAndBalls W in Min ,  W Dal ,  W in Hou ,  W Orl ,  L Mia ,  W NO  ( W Phx at home ,  L LAkers )  .  5 / 6 irrational confidence
3	CJ Mccullum looking NBA ready .  Mid Major what ?   # ripcity
3	 # TheStarters  @ jeskeets you said BS on Dwight shooting fts 90 %  in practice  & amp ;  I did too .  Then ,  a miracle .  
3	 @ GregBowie :  Funniest Overdose this year  ( that sentence makes me sound like a monster to those not in the know )  .   # TBJ
3	 @ GuysAndBalls well then I get to change the lakers one to W too now that Kobes getting 0 assists again and Pau tore his  [ hard to spell ] 
3	Speaking of KCP :  my fantasy team is Caldwell Pope John Lucas III  # thestarters
3	Following up with Westbrook discussion  ( RE : more like cat or dog )  .  Which player looks more like a reptile :  Bosh or Barbosa ?   # tbj  @ treykerby
3	Derrick Rose had to know hes likely to reinjure either leg  so he took every precaution and as much time as possible .  Hope he returns soon . 
3	Upon hearing ejections  @ blazermb said :   " all Draymond Green has done tonight is wear short pants and run around .  They lose nothing .  "   # RipCity
3	Gortat praises Stan Van says if his old coach comes back to league hed like to play for him .  Id love to see Stan replace Witttman  # Wizards
3	 @ NBA now officially gives technicals for enthusiasm with that BS tech on  @ MettaWorldPeace for cheering after making a tough shot . 
3	Big  # nba deadline :  dexter pittman  & amp ;  Jordan Crawford headline the 2 big deals - could we see 1 more blockbuster involving Nolan smith ?   # 55mins
3	 @ StartersMatt no but I sent the info on the source to Tas .  Sorry I just feel more comfortable send info to someone whos verified .  . 
3	Itd been 353 passes since Mariota threw an interception .  That has to be the most unlucky pick for him too ,  incredible play  # GoDucks
3	 # RipCity was alive and well tonight .  Wes carried 1st half then Lillard ,  Batum ,  Aldridge carried us home .   # blazers
3	Cousins told ref  " dont act like a f - ing female "  then gets tossed .  I wonder if those are related events .   # sonics  # nba  
3	With Shabazz Muhammad and Dieng ,  I sense a rebuild after trading Love .  Or S / T Pekovic to avoid bad contract  +  take back Leonard or other C
3	For the record ,  i thought booing was more over bad long shot by freeland on chalupa than booing the whole blazer team  @ blazersedge  # ripcity
3	Remember when Meyers and Miller were talking halfway through the 3rd ?  Meyers apparently remembered .   # ripcity
3	Monroe  & amp ;  Drummond grabbin countless boards off J Smith  & amp ;  Brandon Jennings bad shot selection .  . Dumars ,  you crazy SOB ,  youre a genius  # pistons
3	That  @ DWRIGHTWAY1 hustle defense  and rebound was the play of the game  # RipCity  # blazers
3	 @ TasMelas says I cant reply to message unless you follow me  ( this is not a ploy .  . I swear )  . 
3	Big Ibaka punches Blake griffin in groin n just gets a fine but lil Andre Miller  suspended for running shove at Griffin ?   # nojusticefordre
3	Buddy at ASG sent a pic he took of  @ TasMelas and  # tbj crew .  Guess he likes to take pictures of people he doesnt know too .  . 
3	Another look at that Kobe facial on Hump and G - Wall 
3	 @ treykerby odd phobia update :  Damian Lillard elaborates on his fear of statues 
3	 @ LeighEllis big night for your boy Byron dont call me BJ !  With that stat line and his posterizing LMA ,  all star ?   # TBJ
3	 @ TasMelas Kyrie cant win anything because  " so much on his plate .  "  Maybe 2014 he only does 1 event so he has a shot at winning ?   # TBJ
3	dont think  # timberwolves match mean  # blazers offer  & amp ;  hope to retain both Rubio  +  Love .  W /  2 overpaid starters ,  Love is in Aldridge scenario
3	I physically had to stifle my laughter with both hands when  @ TasMelas dropped REMba Walker on  # TBJ pun gun ,  so as not to disturb coworkers . 
3	God himself couldnt take Kobe out of the game now ,  much less DAntoni . 
3	The problem  @ Dame _ Lillard is having this year is he drives hard to rack but all shooters are on perimeter so no one to pass to .   # blazers
3	Am I the only one like  " shhh stotts ,  we can hear your play !  "  ?
