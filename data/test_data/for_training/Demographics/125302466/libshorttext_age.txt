-0.5	 @ Londonneur However however noble our goals are for our local areas ,  the companies who own the lorries will always win it seems  :  ( 
-0.5	 @ Londonneur I am all for that I dont know if you have heard of the A228 ?  its a road that leads from Thamesport that i ride full of lorries ! 
-0.5	 @ Londonneur this was the advert if you didnt see it  :  )  
-0.5	 @ Londonneur 2 / 2 maybe we should have similar ones for cyclists  ? 
-0.5	 @ Londonneur do you remember that advert a few years ago where the little girl gets hit by a car at 40mph and it shows how it breaks her 1 / 2
-0.5	 @ LozKaye  @ tpb Indeed  -  it is just getting out of control now ,  ah well glad my 6 - 7 mirrors havent been found by them yet  # timetogotofreends
-0.5	 @ Londonneur Id probably be unconcious not just grimacing ,  not trying to argue ,  just dont feel the image shows the risk fully
-0.5	 @ Londonneur my pain thresholds may be different to yours but im sure having my legs run over by a lorry and more than likely hitting my head
-0.5	 @ Londonneur whilst the helmet wouldnt protect her the picture shows that yes she got hit but she looks fine .  Either way the image isnt good
-0.5	 @ tpb  @ LozKaye UK Police Orders Registrars to Suspend Domains of Torrent Sites :  The newly founded .  .  .  .

-0.5	 @ TheckPhD dont suppose by any chance you have done a weak aura to track the tank legendary cape cool down ? 
-0.5	 @ cutaia _ net  @ AskMrRobot I know what you mean but in saying that I have yet to ser a boss that drops an item I want from the prot table lol
