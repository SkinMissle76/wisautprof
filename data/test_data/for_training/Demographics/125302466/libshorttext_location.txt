23	 @ Londonneur However however noble our goals are for our local areas ,  the companies who own the lorries will always win it seems  :  ( 
23	 @ Londonneur I am all for that I dont know if you have heard of the A228 ?  its a road that leads from Thamesport that i ride full of lorries ! 
23	 @ Londonneur this was the advert if you didnt see it  :  )  
23	 @ Londonneur 2 / 2 maybe we should have similar ones for cyclists  ? 
23	 @ Londonneur do you remember that advert a few years ago where the little girl gets hit by a car at 40mph and it shows how it breaks her 1 / 2
23	 @ LozKaye  @ tpb Indeed  -  it is just getting out of control now ,  ah well glad my 6 - 7 mirrors havent been found by them yet  # timetogotofreends
23	 @ Londonneur Id probably be unconcious not just grimacing ,  not trying to argue ,  just dont feel the image shows the risk fully
23	 @ Londonneur my pain thresholds may be different to yours but im sure having my legs run over by a lorry and more than likely hitting my head
23	 @ Londonneur whilst the helmet wouldnt protect her the picture shows that yes she got hit but she looks fine .  Either way the image isnt good
23	 @ tpb  @ LozKaye UK Police Orders Registrars to Suspend Domains of Torrent Sites :  The newly founded .  .  .  .  
23	 @ Londonneur I love that whilst trying to promote safety they have gone nah she dont need a helmet  : p
23	 @ TheckPhD thanks ,  just after raid time so yeah good for me  :  ) 
23	 @ TheckPhD Thanks  -   ( tries to work out time difference )  I think its during my raid time but hey its pally tanking TOT hit it and wait to win
23	 @ TheckPhD hmmm okey dokey ill take a look  -  my WA experience extends as far as looking to see what you did and trying to mimic it  : P
23	 @ TheckPhD and I assume I am right in thinking that this is the debuff ?  
23	 @ TheckPhD Yeah I use all your other prot ones  :  )  have also done my own for meta gem procs  -  but cant seem to get one counting down the 2 min
23	 @ TheckPhD dont suppose by any chance you have done a weak aura to track the tank legendary cape cool down ? 
23	 @ cutaia _ net  @ AskMrRobot I know what you mean but in saying that I have yet to ser a boss that drops an item I want from the prot table lol
23	 @ AskMrRobot is this reference my druid ?  If so its still wrong unbuffed you have me at 29 %  but Im actually at 17 % 
23	 @ cutaia _ net  @ AskMrRobot remember whilst blizz like the use of haste for protadins they didnt intend for it to be our main stat  :  ) 
23	 @ AskMrRobot you appear to be having some issues today ,  haste is off compared to the armory
