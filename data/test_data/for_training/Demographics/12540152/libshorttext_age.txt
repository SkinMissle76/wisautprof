-0.2	 @ natashalindblom Yeah .  .  .  In quite different ways .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ Gumtree I presume Bristol and Newport being deemed a part of Dorset is a known issue thats cropped up over the last few days ? 
-0.2	 @ DhubAgency A nice thought ,  but I fear it would lack the necessary glitz for today’s fickle audience . 
-0.2	 @ DavidGouge Or perhaps they thought your new company had bought you a themed hoodie ?   ( Cyberdyne would no doubt be a generous employer .  ) 
-0.2	Ah ,  the thrill - ride that is Louise getting a new laptop .  First ,  we un - install all the crap .  Then ,  then we install lots of other crap .  Yays ! 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn No way  -  Im saving up for the life size bust of Nicolas Cage . 
-0.2	 @ dephotographic I  * think *  youre allowed to these says if theyre SAS or SSDs .   ( Ideally a SAS SSD .  )   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ sydlawrence Irrespective of the phrase ,  it just smacks of HR desperation / trying too hard .  Or perhaps Im just not LinkedIn enough .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	Dont you just hate it when things auto - tweet .  Because you set it up .  Ages ago .  And forgot all about it .  You fool . 
-0.2	 @ benembery Or indeed Pixies .  You know ,  if you wanted to spell the bands name correctly . 
-0.2	 @ 3SIDEDCUBE Pretty sure someones hacked your Twitter account  -  there was all this talk of Celine Dion and the word  " cool "  was mentioned . 
-0.2	 @ BmthAirFest Have to admire how poorly the timetable system works on a mobile device .   ( You cant even see the link on the main website .  ) 
-0.2	 " We urgently require a developer with normal body temperature .  Applicants with a fever need not apply .  "  Etc . 
-0.2	 @ KayraAlat  @ Createful Just try playing Zelda  :  A Link to the Past on a PS4 .   ( Quite wise to hang onto the SNES .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz I was going to ask if I could borrow your Lionel Richie  ( dread lord Cthulhu edition )  for use as an MC .   ( I blame  @ whitejamie ) 
-0.2	 @ Createful Tricky one  -  a lot of the earlier games didnt really end .  Probably Blitz on the VIC - 20 .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ odlbmth Oooo .  .  .  so many devices .  Kudos to all involved .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ skattyadz But how does labelling a profession in such a manner contribute in any way to the point the article was attempting to make ? 
-0.2	The degree to which  @ Gumtree have ruined the usability of their site by messing with back button behaviour is really quite impressive . 
-0.2	 @ meetdraw Sometimes  ( a bit )  less is more .  Or ,  you know ,  less .  If you want to be factually accurate .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	Curses  -  all the network ports on my ADSL router are dead .  I may have to give PC World some money rather than wait for a delivery .   :  -  ( 
-0.2	Launch an inquiry into the relationship between parliament and City of London .  
-0.2	 @ DhubAgency 54 "   ? 
-0.2	 @ skattyadz Yup  -  it really depends on the specifics of the data .  Probably easier to detail on SO rather than Twitter .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	Who gives a staggering fuck if Nigella Lawson took cocaine ?  She could subsist on the stuff for all I care .   # whyisthisnews
-0.2	 @ grahamdell Im just surprised youve managed to drag yourself away from the Kardashians .  If theyre still a thing .   # potentialpunchlinefail
-0.2	 @ skattyadz There is the NSOrderedSet of course .  Are  " duplicate "  values valid in this context ? 
-0.2	 @ tescomobilecare Any idea when youll be selling the iPhone 5S ?   (  " Coming soon "  is pretty vague when o2 ,  etc .  are already offering it .  ) 
-0.2	Harrowing ,  yet sadly not even a vague surprise  -  BBC News  -  Snowden leaks :  US and UK crack online encryption 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn If your obsession progresses to  " Centerfold "  by the J .  Geils Band ,  you need to take action .   ( Youve had a good innnings .  ) 
-0.2	It saddens me that one of my highest voted answers on SO is so trivial :  
-0.2	 @ benembery Ooo .  .  .  Ill have to drop £4 on it later .  Cheers for the info .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ Createful But can you possibly be as proactive as the people downstairs ?   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge  @ Phishtitz  .  .  . clasping a bust of what appears to be a horrifically disfigured Lionel Richie . 
-0.2	 @ openemu It’s a beautiful piece of software  -  kudos to all involved  ( and indeed the developers of the original cores )  .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	The time of Sockification is nigh . 
-0.2	Well theres a surprise .  .  .  
-0.2	Something about a zombie outbreak ,  Im guessing .  
-0.2	Normal service will now be resumed . 
-0.2	I appear to have somehow cut myself with a spoon .  Again .   # weliveindangeroustimes
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Gouge - tastic . 
-0.2	Really tired of the fawning over Doctor Who .  If it was such a global cultural touchstone ,  why was it cancelled ?   ( Hint :  Because it was arse .  ) 
-0.2	 @ seanmtracey  @ natashalindblom Godspeed to you both .  Particularly tomorrow ,  when youre at work .   # md19hangover
-0.2	 @ campbellrowley You might want to make the timetable link appear on a mobile device .   ( Responsive design as an anti - pattern ?  )   @ BmthAirFest
-0.2	 @ armyoftrolls Im only around the corner .   ( If I ever bump into Pixel whilst Im being dragged around by a Mini Schnauzer pup Ill say hi .  ) 
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz You still doing that thing where you insert tiny models of buildings up yourself ? 
-0.2	 @ skattyadz And on some decks if you do it  * real slow *  you can get some truly fantastic sounds .   ( The joy of mechanical  " glitch "  effects .  ) 
-0.2	 @ jonginn The lighting alone looks worthy of the price of admission .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz Its nearly as grating as the  " Great client win today !  "  style post .  Who cares ?   ( Your other clients who might be following you ?  ) 
-0.2	Hmm… VVDocumenter - Xcode is reet handy  -  
-0.2	 @ seanmtracey  @ Phishtitz Cant help but think the sound sample is wrong .  Perhaps .  .  .  
-0.2	 @ duncancook Think that might be next year  ( Ill check the calendar )  .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	The background mode in the  @ tweetdeck update is exceptionally irritating .   ( Oddly ,  I close TweetDeck because I  * dont *  want to see tweets .  ) 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Run away .   ( Oh yeah ,  you did .  )   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn I can make it all on my own .  .  .  
-0.2	No ,  he wasnt going to wear the hat .  Yes ,  we were bastards for trying to get him to .   :  -  )  
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan …know how you’ve managed to survive until now ?   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge  @ jonginn  @ MichelleDinan Just think of what you could do with that 50p .   ( I will require video evidence of course .  ) 
-0.2	The very definition of excitement :   " Adobe Reader was updated successfully "  . 
-0.2	 @ Truprint Is it possible to create a blank greeting card without a 70s style logo inelegantly placed on the back or am I missing something ? 
-0.2	Flogging all my retro gaming / computing bits and bobs .  If any of you are interested in any of it let me know  -   
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz Arent the piss - heads supposed to be on the other side of the window ?   ( Hope fun is had by all .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge  @ tomwittlin Of course ,  its also a lot lazier and potentially lawsuit prone as well .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ duncancook Have to agree .  Microsofts utter lack of direction for the past n years is quite horrifying ,  but Ballmer is all heart . 
-0.2	 @ alukeonlife You going through a US proxy or summat ?   ( Must confess Ive never seen an ad on the news BBC site .  ) 
-0.2	Think Ill focus on accumulating mucus today rather than coding .  Yay me ! 
-0.2	 @ DavidGouge Damn ,  you’d have thought they’d at least have Googled the company name .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	Thanks to  @ tweetdeck for making  " Minimise to tray "  optional in the latest Windows update .  Sanity resumes .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ DavidGouge Humans are ultimately fallbile and accidents do happen though ,  so its probably best not to beat yourself up over it if you do . 
-0.2	 @ skattyadz Feel free to read - up on the options and get back to me once youve had a chew .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ nicolajanereed Im just disappointed theyve not monospaced Comic Sans ,  for the ultimate win .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge Im not saying there werent consequences  ( I may have irreparably damaged my sinuses for example )  ,  but the coffee was saved . 
-0.2	 @ jonginn Im sorry ,  but the whole steam train ending is a  * BIG *  step too far .   ( The Biff equivalent is quite good in 3 that said .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ natashalindblom So disappointed that link wasnt .  .  .  
-0.2	 @ odlbmth The Nokia 820 is  * so *  futuristic looking .   ( At least in terms of its system clock .  )   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ natashalindblom Ive heard its a highly coordinated digital navel gazing extravaganza .   # clearlyalie
-0.2	 @ benembery Whats the Pixes EP like ?  Eh ?  Eh ? 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn  @ grahamdell Ah .  .  .  youngsters these days  -  I bet they didnt even check domain availability .  They dont know theyre born . 
-0.2	A horrifying thought  -  at some point in the future ,  someone ,  somewhere will attempt a remake The Big Lebowski  # therearerules
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan Ive fixed your breakfast image to make it internet compatible .   ( I may have had too much coffee .  )  
-0.2	 @ FivebyFiveUK Was wondering why youd attached the cups and saucers to the wall .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	Are people still using flickr ,  or is tumblr just less hassle these days ? 
-0.2	 @ DhubAgency I’ve  * finally *  found my calling in life .  Farewell internet ,  it’s the life of a sideshow freak for me…
-0.2	 @ seanmtracey Perhaps  @ maplintweet is just working towards complex structures like parseable sentences .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz Most money donated via the medium of swearing ?   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan Thanks .  Im considering running a series of seminars to teach others .  Just need my eyes to stop bleeding first .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge I guess checking content prior to go - live isnt agile enough or something .   ( Or perhaps Im just old fashioned .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ DavidGouge You are .  .  .  LIVING .  THE .  DREAM .   ( Nice bit of tubing youve got there .  ) 
-0.2	Yays !   -  RT  @ Redweb :  Ace two - page spread about Head To Head in the new issue of the  @ brewersguardian e - mag :  
-0.2	iOS Design Patterns  -  
-0.2	 @ wiebow Must confess I never understood those people who hated the cel - shaded look  -  it was stunning then and still looks pretty damn fine . 
-0.2	 @ grahamdell Theyre doing field of dreams ?  
-0.2	 @ jonginn Id call it lazy journalism ,  but I wouldnt have thought  @ WillardFoxton deserves such an accolade . 
-0.2	 @ alukeonlife Odd .   ( Im not seeing any ads .  )  Are you running any odd plug - ins or anything ? 
-0.2	 @ armyoftrolls Looks like a nice table .   ( Although my heart will always belong to The Addams Family .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Dont listen to what theyre all saying ,  Dan  -  this is perfectly normal behaviour .   # danisclearlyafreak
-0.2	 @ skattyadz Why innovate when you can simply sue those that do .   ( A sad day indeed .  ) 
-0.2	Perhaps those agencies should also advertise for roadie developers and bus driver developers .   # allabouttheconsistency
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan  @ jonginn 50p if you walk up to the most sullen person in view ,  hug them and tell them to turn their frown upside down .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ DhubAgency Sorry about that .  Lets just pretend I said 11 2 "  and say no more about it . 
-0.2	 @ richstrachan I sadly suspect youd be disappointed . 
-0.2	Chortles .  
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz In  " milking youth "  shocker .  Sort of .  cc  @ KayraAlat
-0.2	 @ skattyadz BBC or Amiga BASIC ?   ( If its BBC basic ,  this can also run on the A7000 +  ,  which might be a better option as it has VGA out .  ) 
-0.2	 @ armyoftrolls Its a long shot ,  but is Pixel the Pug briskly rotating in Meyrick Park in that piccy ? 
-0.2	Somehow loading a storyboard scene as a sub - view feels particularly bad - ass when the Theme From Shaft is playing .   # canyoudigit
-0.2	 @ duncancook Possibly .  Have you used a deodorant ?   ( Not rock n roll ,  but probably a good idea .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ wiebow Think I might have to un - box the Cube one of these days .   ( The  " lava "  level still sticks in my mind as a particularly epic design .  ) 
-0.2	Hmm .  .  .  .  Im getting too old for this .  Tomorrow  ( or in fact today )  is going to hurt . 
-0.2	 @ BellaLewisSmith Pity that the  ( quite valid )  point he was attempting to make was lost due to his needlessly antagonistic approach . 
-0.2	 @ jonginn I suspect its best to pretend the third one simply doesnt exist . 
-0.2	 @ wiebow Must confess reading your earlier tweet made me want to spin up my GameCube .   :  -  )   ( Cant justify a Wii - U .  )  Any new dungeons ? 
-0.2	 @ natashalindblom  @ seanmtracey Im just sad that I wont be there to bear witness to it all / become needlessly drunk . 
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan Have to agree with  @ jonginn  -  Fez is a brilliant game and a visual treat to boot if youre a fan of pixel art and glitch .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ BellaLewisSmith No worries  -  hope you find someone good .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	Is stating the fucking obvious a meme now or something ? 
-0.2	 @ armyoftrolls I think The Addams Family and Star Trek TNG absorbed  * way *  too much of coinage back in the day .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge If only youd whispered .  .  .   " Ive been alone with you inside my mind "   @ Phishtitz would have appeared curiously quickly .   # hello
-0.2	 @ duncancook True .  Im guessing their  " apps "  wouldnt use any native / optional hardware capabilities then ,  which is fine for some  " apps "  . 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn 
-0.2	 @ tomwittlin  @ MichelleDinan  @ whitejamie  @ m _ sephton Would anyone watch it though ?   ( The product placement would be far too intrusive .  )   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	Fancy some jolly nice prints of retro computing stuff and soft toys ?  If so ,  theres a sale on until Sunday -  
-0.2	 @ grahamdell Just as long as you dont you have to actually watch it to participate .   ( Not sure I like the sound of that .  ) 
-0.2	 @ whitejamie Thanks .  I think Ill probably take the rest of the day off  -  it can only go downhill from here . 
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan Hes epically cute at the moment ,  it has to be said .   ( I forgive him for the lack of sleep ,  repeated  " play "  biting ,  etc .  )   :  -  ) 
-0.2	The hairy baby that shits in the garden is just back from his first trip to the groomers . Damn .  He cute .  
-0.2	Nice to see a company thats serious about training staff  -  read about  @ folkdigital  ( and their Magento certs )  here :  
-0.2	The  @ facebook pages system really is staggering inconsistent .  Even displaying comments on posts ordered by posting date seems impossible . 
-0.2	 @ wiebow Maybe its just wishful thinking on my part  -  SNES style Zelda on iOS would be simply epic .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	Thought for the day :  When someone says  " shit hot "  ,  do they just mean 37° C ? 
-0.2	 @ skattyadz Can you do the thing where you hold down play and fast forward at the same time ?   # nostalgicglee
-0.2	 @ duncancook Have to wonder how much such thoughts are due to some agencies not having the in - house experience of  " proper "  programming .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz I  * really *  dont understand agencies that do this  -  who do they think their followers are ?  Either tell us now ,  or give over . 
-0.2	Squeezy fish happy  -  we are clearly living in enlightened times .  
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Im talkin bout Shaft . 
-0.2	 @ FolkDevs Its all better now ,  but  @ stackstatus is your friend .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ TobyPestridge You could always start it off by tying some cans of export to a bit of string and dragging it behind a car .   # anyone
-0.2	 @ DavidGouge Its a bit like their  " The iPad is crap ,  buy a Surface "  ads  -  the only takeaway is that MS is looking increasingly desperate . 
-0.2	 @ Phishtitz  @ whitejamie  @ LeeR0y I aint wearing no wire . 
-0.2	 @ armyoftrolls Must confess Ive always been fascinated with pinball machines  -  the later ones were a beautiful mix of analog and digital . 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn  @ grahamdell Ah .  .  .  another year without any more podcasts .   :  -  ( 
-0.2	 @ wiebow True ,  but I can see the 3DS being their last hardware success .  I guess well see how the 2DS fares ,  although its niche by intent . 
-0.2	 @ wiebow Happy travels on the King of Red Lions .   :  -  )   # suchadamngoodgame
-0.2	 @ tomwittlin Is that you just off to the left standing sort of nearby it ? 
-0.2	Is  " rockstar developer "  this years  " digital animal "  ,  or am I just being jaded again ? 
-0.2	On a different tack ,  I just managed to repeatedly cough with a mouthful of coffee and not spray it everywhere .   # rockstarcoffeedrinker
-0.2	 @ alukeonlife It must think youre outside of the country ,  although why it does this only on the NI vids is curious .  Any thoughts  @ BBCwebdev
-0.2	 @ jamiecurle  @ sydlawrence And how long before its simply a case of  " extreme in the minds of our corporate paymasters "  . 
-0.2	 @ DhubAgency I’m not convinced it would complement my monocle .  Like the idea of the tour though ,  as I’d be a bit like The Littlest Hobo then . 
-0.2	Sad ,  but I suspect  @ NolanBushnell has nailed it  -  
-0.2	 @ spolsky Nice to see it live .   :  -  )    ( Looks a  * little *  bit too contrasty on white though ,  if I’m being honest .  ) 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Sorry about that .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ folkdigital Im guessing most particle physicists will beg to differ . 
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan  @ TobyPestridge  @ jonginn Thats not the attitude .   ( Besides ,  you could  * invest it *  .  You know ,  for your future .  And stuff .  ) 
-0.2	 @ richstrachan What utter ,  utter cunts . 
-0.2	 @ duncancook Its probably only rock n roll if youve not slept yet .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	Busting some retro gaming moves whilst looking after a poorly pup .  
-0.2	 @ tomwittlin Based on the latest evidence ,  I do believe that you in fact may  * be *  it ,  or at least an indubitable facsimile of it .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ revoltingross Mary .  Loves .  Dick . 
-0.2	 @ skattyadz You could use an NS ( Mutable ) Set or NS ( Mutable ) CountedSet  -  theyre a  * lot *  faster when checking membership . 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Liking the top hats on the Easter egg .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn  @ grahamdell Oh shit  -  I feel a throw down brewing . 
-0.2	 @ grahamdell Yup ,  I cant imagine why any business would use  @ facebook when the feature set / consistency is such a complete mess . 
-0.2	And so it begins .   # planesandstuff
-0.2	 @ DhubAgency Yet tragically not lucrative in any meaningful sense . 
-0.2	 @ alukeonlife Why would you even need that ?  I dont own a tablet ,  so Im bringing my desktop and a petrol generator .  An obvious solution .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ MichelleDinan Im already regretting not adding some spindly little He - Man arms ,  but such is life .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ sydlawrence I think youll find the phrase is  " evil bottom "  .   ;  -  )

-0.2	 @ 49ology  @ Phishtitz It’s fantastically upbeat as well .   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 @ jonginn It could have been worse  -  you might of had a small chunk of pizza stuck to one of your teeth .   :  -  ) 
-0.2	iOS 7 GM is rather nice ,  even without the eye candy .   ( I dont have an iPhone 5 ,  sadly .  )  Borderless buttons still feel a UX own goal though . 
-0.2	 @ YourCapnSpeakn Somewhat ironic ,  bearing in mind his questionable parental attributes . 
-0.2	 @ Createful Worrying .  Very worrying .   ( Nice sofa ,  incidentally .  )   ;  -  ) 
-0.2	 .   @ Createful  -    @ KayraAlat said that he didnt have any space for the PS4 and that I should look after it .   ( At least until the PS5 arrives .  ) 
-0.2	 @ wiebow I checked out a comparison video earlier  -  it looks  ( even more )  lovely .
