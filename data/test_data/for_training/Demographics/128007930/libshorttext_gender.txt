-1	 @ RobbtJay  @ stevenchapple looks pretty damning from every direction I can look at it .  Seems only a matter of time before  # SWP withers away . 
-1	Advent of penny post meant sending letter became attainable for anyone .  Very little is know of  # chartist movement in Cardiff ,  this adds lots
-1	Ill be on  @ BBCRadioWales Good Morning Wales show tomorrow morning to talk about  # spycops  # policespiesoutoflives probably about 8am
-1	Just pre - recorded an interview about  # spycops for  @ BBCRadioWales  -  should be going out sometime in the 2 hours  # policespiesoutoflives
-1	Vindictive cruelty of UK asylum policy is sickening ,  huge effort to send terminally ill to die has become normalised 
-1	Downloaded  @ ihrc Know Your Rights app about being stopped at airports under Schedule 7 Terrorism Act 2000

-1	Sometimes it seems like deadly collective punishment of  # Gaza is a Xmas tradition ,  but then you remember it happens the rest of the year too
-1	It seems that the writing style of  # chartist leader John Frost is very similar to the radio persona of Tony Handcock ! 
-1	copsoffcampuses :  Organising protest is becoming a risky business nowadays ,  so we hope you will forgive our .  .  .  
-1	This seems the most illuminating report of recent  # SWP conference ,  explains why only the most loyal havent left
