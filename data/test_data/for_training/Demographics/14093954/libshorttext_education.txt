3	Amazing service from  @ ToolstationUK  -  order placed yesterday afternoon  ( Sunday )  ,  and its here already ! 
3	 @ Doctor _ Hutch On a positive note ,  buying an electric toothbrush for someone to help clean their bike could be unexpected and welcome ! 
3	 @ CXHelen  @ ChallengeTires Youre way below the recommended pressure for those tyres .   Arent you running the risk of pinch flats ?

3	Route Builder by  @ Strava seems to work rather well ;  could be especially useful in unfamiliar territory .   More info :  
3	Mac OSX and iOS just got a bit closer .  Mobile apps can send push notifications to Mavericks ,  and on to your website !  
3	 @ tripleox  @ searchmartin Thanks for this  -  tracking bots in GA works a treat ,  and is great to watch in Real - Time mode !   # Analytics
3	About to take number 1 teenage son for a haircut .  Yes ,  this is a big deal . 
3	 @ JoeFletch I cant decide whether he was being facetious or just naive !   Probably neither ,  but Im none the wiser anyway . 
3	I really dont know what to make of this small website survey from  @ mattcutts :   
3	My Windows 7 laptop had a BSOD when coming out of sleep mode  -  rather disconcerting ! 
3	Another PHP photo upload tool completed  -  this time its for uploading to Wikimedia .   MediaWiki documentation was very helpful ! 
3	Just spent hours getting Minecraft working again on family PC ,  after removing Nvidia graphics card .  Energy - sapping ,  but got there in the end
3	 @ si _ lumb  @ ruskin147  @ carlton I entirely concur with this ;  Minecraft is  ( or can be )  a powerful learning tool .  Very addictive for my kids too ! 
3	 @ Jim _ Clayton Whoops ,  thanks Jim !  I definitely meant Norwich City .   Theyre a very tasteful green  :  )

3	 @ powerofthegroup  @ SeniorBuyingPwr Great video .   This scheme could really help to make heating oil more affordable ! 
3	High frequency trading being investigated on Radio 4 .  Such a parasitic  & amp ;  absurd financial instrument ,  symptomatic of short - termism

3	 @ Jim _ Clayton Nice one Jim .   Bit easier than riding a 12 - hr !

3	 @ CXHelen Oh ,  but very well done of course !   You certainly know your stuff  :  ) 
3	 @ ruskin147  @ bbc5live All at once or one at a time ? 
3	Tip of the day ,  if you do a lot of uploading over an ADSL line :  if its around 400kbps ,  ask your ISP to remove the uplink limit . 
3	Bitvise SSH client for Windows ,  with keypair support .   Why didnt I know about this before ?  ?   # sysadmin
3	Such a nice day out there ,  and Im stuck indoors doing paperwork !  
3	Twitters moving to 64 - bit user IDs .  Check your app code against  @ Overflow64 and  @ 64Flavors accounts 
3	Im about to start work migrating a poorly written site over to Symfony .   It can only get better ,  right ? 
3	Such a wet and miserable day for a trip to Norwich !   I think Ill take the train ,  but will cycle home  -  into a strong headwind  :  / 
3	 @ Jim _ Clayton  @ amisvelo Its going to be a very muddy one ,  I suspect ! 
3	Finally got around to coding a tool for uploading my website photos to Flickr .   phpFlickr is just the client for this !

3	 @ InstantWild All I get is this message that a cameras subscription is already active  -  but it isnt !  
3	Alternatives to landline broadband discussed on BBC  # YouandYours  -  but no mention of satellite broadband !  Definitely a viable option .

3	That was a satisfying ,  but taxing ,  CSS refactoring :  1100 lines added ;  12300 lines deleted . 
3	Phew ,  huge fry - up for 5 hungry kids is now over .  Bacon ,  sausage ,  eggs ,  beans ,  mushrooms ,  tomatoes ,  waffles ,  fried bread  -  and nothing burnt ! 
3	Got some feedback for  @ google search policies ?   Let them know here :  
3	Sons iPad2  ( on iOS7 )  froze on him the other night .   Wouldnt even respond to holding silver button down .   Had to let battery drain down !

3	 @ powerofthegroup Agreed .  Its not really about when you buy your oil  ( within reason )  ,  its really about who you buy it from . 
3	 @ KaptainKosmic Thanks !   It was at the Gas Hill Gasp ,  not one of my better events .  .  . 
3	Eastern region cyclocross membership is finally open !   First event is on 7 September ,  so dont delay .  
3	 @ KaptainKosmic Just keep away as long as you can !   Being caught is inevitable ,  for once . 
3	 @ Kwdmiller  @ TimothyOShea Thats good .  Im sure that youve covered worst - case scenarios ,  but it still must be a tough nut to crack

3	 @ lovenorfolk  @ tripleox Dandy Horse is great !  I enjoyed a coffee there with local cycling journalist ,  whilst bike safely stowed out back . 
3	En route to London for business meeting .  Sunny warm day ;  would like to have cycled part of way .  Not to be !

3	Great support and quick fix from Alan at  @ scriptrock when node diffs failed to load .   Its such a useful sysadmin web service ! 
3	 @ johnbfagan Well done John ,  youre in great shape !   The trampoline somersault challenge sounds harder though  -  be careful  :  ) 
3	About time ,  too !  UK government scraps the paper car tax disc 
3	 @ CXHelen  @ ChallengeTires Quite agree .  I love riding on Challenge Griffo open tyres ,  they really inspire confidence ! 
3	 @ Jules _ Foto I think you meant  @ GraemeObree
3	 @ jaytay Thanks for the tip ,  Jim .   Id be surprised if my son hadnt tried that ,  though  -  he was getting pretty desperate !   # ios7

3	 @ Simone _ E _ Morris Thanks for that !   Heres the Royal Mail web page about it ,  for anyone wanting more info :  
3	Inbox segregation is a good enough reason for me to stop using the gmail iOS app .   Its back to Apples default mail app for me . 
3	I like the idea of  @ InstantWild to help identify creatures from motion - sensitive cameras ,  but cant get the iphone app to work .  Frustrating ! 
3	Getting packed up for cyclocross tomorrow  ( Eastern Cross ,  round 2 )  Damn ,  theres a lot of stuff needed ! 
3	Aah ,  that sense of relief when a clients website runs without modification in your development environment  :  ) 
3	Shout - out to Norfolk folk :  Wroxham is apparently gridlocked due to roadworks .   Go there at your peril !   ( unless youre on a bike of course )

3	 @ ianpegg Dont think that I have time for Epic .   It does look good though ! 
3	 @ TimothyOShea jFloat self - insurance looks flawed to me .   Surely the main point of insurance is to protect against massive liabilities ? 
3	 @ jaytay Fantastic reading !  Our kids have read our Calvin  & amp ;  Hobbes collection so much over the years that theyre falling apart
3	 @ tripleox Thats a great article  -  Ill try and find a few minutes later to have a play !   # bot  # Analytics
3	Wondering how the Eastern Cross seniors race is progressing .  .  .   & lt ; sigh & gt ;
