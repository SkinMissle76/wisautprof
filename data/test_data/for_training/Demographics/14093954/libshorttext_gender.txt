-1	Route Builder by  @ Strava seems to work rather well ;  could be especially useful in unfamiliar territory .   More info :

-1	 @ ianpegg Dont think that I have time for Epic .   It does look good though ! 
-1	 @ TimothyOShea jFloat self - insurance looks flawed to me .   Surely the main point of insurance is to protect against massive liabilities ?
