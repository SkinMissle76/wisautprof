2	 @ andrea _ r  @ Ipstenu OK ,  Ill see if I can find it ,  or just leave it for now .  Not a big problem .  Thanks . 
2	 @ peterchester  @ ModernTribeInc Need to check your wording for both re  " Dont apply if your timezone is NOT outside of US range "  . 
2	 @ andrea _ r  @ Ipstenu OK .  Is that something that could be suggested ?  If so ,  where do I post that idea or who do I sweet - talk ? 
2	 @ andrea _ r  @ ipstenu If Im a non - primary contributor to a plugin ,  do I not have Resolved permissions on related WPORG Support forum tickets ? 
2	 @ realFATmedia No ,  Sherlock is busy . 
2	 @ realFATmedia Not from me .  Id send whatever the UK version is ,  to really screw you over . 
2	 @ realFATmedia I told you before ,  its fine to copy my Gists . 
2	 @ tcapr Of course there are other providers ,  but Im delighted with  @ SiteGround
2	 @ sarahpressler No ,  hes kept you up for 3 hours !  Thats not all night . 
2	Its 06 : 37 .  The kids are waking up .  I have apparently missed my chance of sleeping . 
2	 @ PhaseCreative Of course it does ,  thats why we added that shortcode attribute in  ;  -  )   @ ClickWP
2	 @ TheCre8tiveDiva Ping  @ gregoirenoyelle or  @ paul _ wp
2	 @ chrislema If youre targeting just the anchor  ( wont affect single entry headlines )  ,  then  . entry - title  & gt ;  a  {  }  is better  ( child selector )  . 
2	 @ jpetersen Why abbreviate ?  Not like short of space ,  or facing a multi - lingual audience . 
2	 @ chrislema No need for the  . 0 in the line - height value .  Waste of bytes .  The article already implies it can be a decimal if needed . 
2	 @ jpetersen So ,  6th of July then ?  .  .  . 
2	 @ chrislema Did you investigate  @ LeanPub ?   @ tnorthcutt
2	 @ Otto42  @ williamsba Ill add it to my to do list to go find them again . 
2	Looking for info about certain brand of chewy sweets .  Found 
2	 @ RafalTomal Just because it works ,  doesnt mean it cant be improved  ;  -  ) 
2	 @ sarcasmically Are they like hard - boiled sweets ? 
2	 @ sarcasmically And a taffy ? 
2	 @ thewebprincess Oh ,  yes .  Used to most Twitterers being several hours behind me !  Was only to accept the contact .  Can chat another day . 
2	 @ stubbornella I know you favourited my last tweet at you re WP admin CSS ,  so you might like 
2	 @ sarcasmically I now realise that US junk food terminology doesnt always translate to British .  Taffy here is a Welsh man ,  and twizzler ? 
2	 @ SiteGround Thanks to your Support and Sales team today ,  particularly Dimitar G  # greatjob
2	 @ thewebprincess  * poke *   -  Skype  ;  -  ) 
2	 @ sarcasmically So pie and donut .  What other food stuffs are you embellished with ? And if I may be so brazen in a non - critical way :  why ? 
2	 @ sarcasmically What sort of pie ?  Wheres the evidence ? 
2	 @ sarcasmically Probably the dust burning .  Give it an hour ,  and it should clear .  Or youll be dead from carbon monoxide . 
2	 @ sarcasmically So what makes you qualified to judge pies ? 
2	 @ RafalTomal Not looked ,  not even at the front - end code ,  and cant see the back !  Just wondered if any focus was made on more than just design
2	 @ jpetersen But I dont want to give up Runescape .  .  . 
2	 @ katedavis You know how to live ,  girl ! 
2	 @ realFATmedia I dont tell people want to do with their code .  I make  " suggestions "  ,  and keep making them until they do the change . 
2	 @ RafalTomal Did the quality of the code improve though ? 
2	 @ Otto42  @ williamsba Pretty sure I saw some variables in use when looking through various code in Meta Trac .  .  . 
2	 @ JPEGmini Is the technology behind JPEGmini suitable to be ported to a WordPress plugin ,  a la WP - Smushit ? 
2	Not entirely sure what it is ,  but its from  @ pippinsplugins and regards an affiliate plugin for WP .  Sign up !  
2	Finally got around to updating the  # genesiswp major versions comparison chart  ( lines of code versus time )  :  
2	 @ GraphDesigning Filter genesis _ entry _ content .  global  $ wp _ query ;  if  ( 0  =  =  =   $ wp _ query -  & gt ; current _ post  )   {  the _ content (  )   }  else  { the _ excerpt (  )   } 
2	 @ SiteGround How many WP installs does the GoGeek account allow ? 
2	Right ,  thats it .  Fed up with my old reseller host ,  so watch out  @ SiteGround ,  Im moving it all to you ! 
2	 @ cdils So how do I get in touch with all of them ? 
2	 @ cdils Not necessarily aiming at devs for ebook content ,  but I realise that the hashtag probably isnt frequented by as any non - devs . 
2	 @ sarahpressler  @ zoe _ rooney The clever bit ,  is to be able to make any selected text tweetable . 
2	 @ cdils And ignore that atrocious typo ! 
2	 @ grapplerulrich See the  / all page on the site via non - mobile to see list of devices  @ johnholtripley
2	 @ cdils i . e .  ebooks in the G community ,  but around which topics .  I got some replies by tweets ,  but not many . 
2	 @ cdils AIUI ,  the usual is to think of a product ,  then test if their is an audience .  I have an audience ,  and want to find a sellable product . 
2	 @ cdils How best to find out what your preferred audience actually wants . 
2	 @ curtismchale No ,  thats your job for life . 
2	 @ OhHelloDesigns In which case ,  ask why they approached you ,  what they value about your offering .  YOU decide if they can be a good client . 
2	 @ madebyjared Plus ,  with no indication of the tooltip even existing ,   " standard "  users wont find it except by accident . 
2	 @ madebyjared Those on touch devices ,  and those with physical impairment to use a mouse  /  manage to stay over target element for a start . 
2	 @ madebyjared Thats going to hinder accessibility . 
2	 @ simonwheatley Our two prefer the spicier food too .  Give them cloud juice to go with it . 
2	 @ OhHelloDesigns Did they approach you ?  Or did you approach them ? 
2	 @ OhHelloDesigns No .  One rule is to tell them the What ,  and the Why ,  but not the How . 
2	 @ gregoirenoyelle Good to know ,  Thank you . 
2	 @ sarcasmically Developers appreciate the specifics things to fix . 
2	 @ aydreeuhn Yes ,  child theme style . css ,  probably in a section towards the bottom  ( before media queries )  ,  so easier to find and copy later . 
2	 @ aydreeuhn Install Genesis Connect for WooCommerce ,  then adapt any remaining styles from there . 
2	 @ simonwheatley Insufficient sample size .  Try again  # applejuiceincoffee
2	 @ heydonworks When theres two elements ,  one for screen readers ,  one for visual .  e . g .  Edit Foobar versus Edit
2	 @ PeteScuff Wish some of them happy Thursday instead . 
2	 @ Clairey _ W Ringing a roofer and house insurance people . 
2	 @ GemmaWeirs Thanks for the suggestion .  That seems to be the most popular one at the moment . 
2	 @ NSWebDesign Thanks .   " Not from existing theme "  would make a nicely progressive ebook . 
2	 @ walterbreakell Send me a contact via 
2	 @ walterbreakell Im open to doing a collaborative Guide .  Want to keep scope of Guides small ,  and have more specific guides . 
2	 @ JustKatieLouise 2005  # youarewelcome 
2	 @ walterbreakell Excellent suggestion ,  thank you ! 
2	Looking for a  # genesiswp child theme ,  HTML5 ,  responsive ,  mobile - first ,  makes gallery post formats look great .  Go ! 
2	 @ bradleypotter Noted ,  thanks ! 
2	Hey  # genesiswp folks .  What Genesis - related topic would you be willing to buy an ebook on ? 
2	 @ pippinsplugins Yep ,  turned two end of Nov ,  but arrived prem at 26 weeks  ( due March )  .  Look after them Tue - Thu  +  other times ,  so work little ! 
2	 @ pippinsplugins Agreed ,   & amp ;  I dont think there are many who work harder than you .  My twins have more nursery from mid Jan ,  so I can work more
2	 @ pippinsplugins I dont want to work hard .  Id rather work smart ,  and thats what I need to change . 
2	Proof that the income I want IS possible .  .  .  RT  @ pippinsplugins :  2013 in Review for me and my plugins business 
2	 @ tommcfarlin Only had chance to run Pro on a few folders ,  as everything else was done ,  but Pro does seem faster  ( uses multiple CPUs )  . 
2	 @ tommcfarlin Have you seen how magic  @ jpegmini is ? 
2	 @ pippinsplugins Dude ,  they are awesome end - of - year numbers .  So happy for you ! 
2	 @ simpledream If you run all the 2010 and 2011 theme images through  @ jpegmini ,  youll save about 80kb with no visual differences .  cc  @ nacin
2	 @ jpegmini Do you have an affiliate scheme for users ? 
2	 @ haa _ harriet  # picsoritdidnthappen
2	 @ Ramoonus If youve got a whole NAS to do ,  its worth going for  @ jpegmini Pro ,  as it does seem faster . 
2	 @ cehwitham Email from  @ jpegmini  this morning with the new activation code for Pro ,  so all good  :  -  )  Definitely seems faster . 
2	 @ ssstofff WCEU ,  WCLDN for a start  :  -  ) 
2	 @ ssstofff Yeah ,  but no .  Passed me by . 
2	 @ cehwitham  @ jpegmini Only the Pro upgrade is .  Speed  ( multi - CPU use I think )  ,  Lightroom plugin ,  and upto 50MB photos  ( from 28MB )  . 
2	 @ cehwitham I bought the £15 . 60 version of  @ jpegmini ,  then paid for the upgrade  ( £62 )  but activation key didnt work  :  -  (  Waiting on support . 
2	Running JPEGmini ,  on syncing Dropbox folder ,  while importing other photos into Lightroom  =  slow as hell response from  ( old )  PC . 
2	Bought  @ JPEGmini earlier .  Took a photos directory of mostly  . jpgs from 10 . 7GB to 5 . 72GB with no visual difference .   # Awesome
2	 @ chrislema Earn enough money .  Buy new PC .  Organise my memories .   # ThreeThreeWordMantras
2	 @ cehwitham Good write - up ,  and useful links at the end . 
2	 @ Jtsternberg Twins head to nursery for twice as long come mid - Jan ,  so I get more work time ! 
2	 @ Jtsternberg Im a rubbish entrepreneur ,  but I like the flexibility to do my own thing ,  online and with twins as needed . 
2	 @ Jtsternberg In fact ,  they enquired with me ,  and now Ive met them ,  Ive had second thoughts about turning them down !  May follow - up in 2014 . 
2	 @ Jtsternberg If I were interested in working for an agency ,  theres a British one I would enquire with first !   # logistics
2	 @ Jtsternberg  @ webdevstudios Its the  " full - time "  aspect that I struggle with right now . 
2	 @ simonwheatley Thanks for 
2	 @ PeteScuff Oh ,  you tease . 
2	 @ leewillis77 Had chance to play with Laravel ? 
2	 @ PeteScuff Ive seen your hand  -  they need to recover from being mangled first . 
2	By jove ,  I think I understand endpoints  ( for my specific use case )  .   / edit ,   / list and  /  ,  tonight ,  I own you . 
2	 @ yoast Im not even 100 %  sure at this moment that endpoints is actually what I need for what I want to try and achieve . 
2	When two advanced developers immediately wish you good luck  ( re WP endpoints )  ,  I suddenly feel a lot less confident . 
2	Diving into the murky world of  # WordPress endpoints .
