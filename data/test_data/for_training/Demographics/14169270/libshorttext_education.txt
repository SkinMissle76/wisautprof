2	And the Bicyclism Award for Best Performance in Le Tour 2011 goes to  -  Thomas Voeckler .   Best Supporting Act :  Thor  Hushovd . 
2	Frankly ,  if it were not for Hushovd ,  Voeckler and GIlbert ,  this TDF would be nothing more than an elaborate French tourism  campaign
2	If any carbon tax system that fails to reward and encourage cycling is nothing more than a fraudulent money grab
2	Le Tour is just like Grand Opera .  Drama ,  hysteria ,  silly plot .  But we dont tend to ask the riders for an encore of another few stages !

2	Whats the value proposition for Local Council rates ?  Everyone else has to explain and justify their charges .  .  . 
2	People should be judged by the amount of road kill they leave behind .  Heaven ,  then ,  is likely to be the domain of cyclists  &  pedestrians ! 
2	The only scientists I really respect are those who work on bicycle technology
2	Not that I agree with it as a policy ,  but with all this why should I pay any carbon tax bleating ,  the human race deserves global warming
2	The only thing I dont want In - My - Back - Yard are a bunch of self obsessed Not - In - My - Back - Yarders
