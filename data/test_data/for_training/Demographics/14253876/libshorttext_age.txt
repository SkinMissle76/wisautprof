-0.52	Mike Dean just Mike Deaned the game . 
-0.52	Oh ,  and i really do feel bad for Eriksen ,  Lloris  & amp ;  Holtby .  Poor guys ,  they just made the wrong choice ! 
-0.52	Itll be blown out proportion ,  and its still funny ,  but Sp * rs loosing to Southampton isnt that shameful anymore .

-0.52	Hearing Vieira say he wanted to finish his career at Arsenal hurts ,  but without him leaving we might never have had  @ cesc4official
-0.52	God I want Vieira back at Arsenal .  Just having him around the club would be magic . 
-0.52	 @ 5carab You can thank Mr Redknapp for that ,  Im sure . 
-0.52	 @ JordanM _ 22 think I paid £280 Im the end . 
-0.52	Fantastic finish .

-0.52	Its still so hard to believe we signed Mesut Ozil for £42 . 5m .  What a player .  What a team . 
-0.52	We are bloody sick at scoring within the first 5 minutes of a kick off . 
-0.52	“ @ MatchOfTheDave :  Chamakh last night .  Bendtner tonight .  Football is broken . ”Next Park will come on and score !
