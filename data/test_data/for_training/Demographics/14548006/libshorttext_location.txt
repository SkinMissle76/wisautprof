17	Just posted a photo  @  Serpentine Bridge 
17	 @ david _ l _ ross its not a retort .  I was asking you a genuine question what your point was ?

17	 @ Ocado delivery booked for 10pm tonight .  Just had a message youre running 5 hours late  -  does this mean it arrives at 3am ?  ! 
17	 @ ocado Now just had another message saying 2hr 20m late ,  meaning past midnight .  Phone rep said midnight would be latest .  This is confusing . 
17	I could not resist !  
17	 @ ihgrewardsclub whats the deal with these alerts you keep sending me today ?  !  
17	Simple query to  @ Hertz CS .  They wait a week to reply ,  then simply ask for the rental agreement no ,  which Id already provided .   # unimpressed
17	Has anyone EVER managed to successfully dry their hands on a  @ VirginTrains train ?  As soon as you get it working ,  move hand ,  they stop ,  ARRGH

17	WiFi not working on  @ VirginTrains 1st class today .  TM says  " he is not an engineer "  ,  and he will log a fault .  What compensation is due ? 
17	 @ JackRobertSmith think your twitter may have been hacked !  Received a DM from you which looks like a phishing attempt to me ! 
17	 @ flybe have known about my delayed flight all day due to their failed aircraft but not communicated .  Theres a reason theyre FlyMaybe

17	nice email ,   @ Pinterest  !  
17	Thinking about it ,  Ive NEVER been on a  @ flybe flight which was on time  # neveragain
