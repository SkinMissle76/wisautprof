21	 @ freemefromtampa   -  Just been taking a break from the Journey ,  it got too epic for a moment .  .  .  . 
21	Ive been hanging out for a while now ,  all this travelling can make a Gnome tired ;  the Journey still goes on .  .  . where should I go next ?  ? 
21	 @ HayLeah11  -  Yes I can breathe in space ,  Gnomes have many mystical and magical powers .  Mars is a little empty for me ,  I like people ! 
21	Today I am in Mexico ,  theres a great Taco spot Im heading to .  Anywhere else I should go today ? 
21	Finally got my camera fixed ,  here I am in Bar Harbor Maine ;  this Pizza place is awesome !  
21	My camera has been acting strange ,  sorry for not posting any photos lately .  The Journey is still in progress ,  today Im in Maine ! 
21	We are losing Followers ,  is the Journey not epic enough ?  Im open to suggestions ,  whats a Gnome to do ?  ? 
21	This morning I celebrated the Summer Soltice  @  Stone Hedge ,  Happy Summer Everyone !  !  
21	As per the request of  @ Maddieeeeeeee ,  here I am in Glastonbury !  Isnt there a Festival that happens here ?  
21	 @ Maddieeeeeeee  -  Im headed to Glastonbury as we speak ,  Ill upload some photos later today . 
21	Ive been travelling around looking for a good photo ,  but there just hasnt been any great sights to capture .  Where should I go next people ? 
21	 @ xXSuperJudeXx -  I am a fan of France when it comes to Soccer ,  here I am with the Team .  
21	 @ freemefromtampa   -  My Cousin works for a Travel Agency ,  he hooks me up ! 
21	Noone was able to guess where I am in my picture ,  its Mt . Hood in Oregon .  I am geting ready for tomorrow ,  its sure to hold many suprises ! 
21	Can anyone guess where I am ?  Ill give you one clue ,  Gnomes have been known to hang out in the hood .  
21	I want to thank everyone who has joined our Epic Journey ,  Ive been in NYC this week ;  where should we go next ?  There are no limits ! 
21	Headed back to NY ,  decided to check out The Statue Of Liberty .  The journey is getting bigger ,  tell everyone !  
21	Today has been nice ,  Niagara Falls are beautiful this time of year .  Where shall we go next ?  ? 
21	Next time I need someone taller to take my photo ,  here I am  @  Niagara Falls .  Where shall we go tomorrow ?  ?  
21	Tomorrow I will take the suggestion given by  @ freemefromtampa and Visit Niagara Falls .  We now have 303 Followers ,  the Journey must go on ! 
21	 @ MorganCline asked that I visit Paris ,  Texas ;  it was tough leaving the concert ,  but here I am in Texas !  
21	Where should the next stop on our Epic Journey be ? 
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  Are you talking about the Concert ,  or town ?  The Town is Quaint ,  the concert was in Bethel NY . 
21	I decided to check out one of the most historical concerts of the last 50 years ,  and to visit an old friend .  
21	Today is a Beautiful day ,  Ill rest for today and make my way somewhere amazing tomorrow .  Perhaps to a Historic Event in the past ,  or future
21	 @ ParisHilton  -  Is there room  @  this party for The Worlds Largest Garden Gnome ?  It would make an excellent addition 2 my Journey ! 
21	 @ Kinghornjwfr  -  You are officially our 300th Follower ,  THANK YOU for joining the most Epic Journey ever ! 
21	Ill be leaving NYC tonight ,  perhaps heading more North .  We have 299 followers ,   # 300 is out there somewhere ! 
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  Yes it does ,  Twitter is NOT being very Gnome Friendly if you ask me .  .  . 
21	Twitter has allowed me to follow one more person ,  we need more Followers ,  that way the Gnome can follow everyone ! 
21	 @ Jrobinson13  -  I was there a few weeks ago ,  it was nice .  Thanks 4 following the Gnome !  Any more suggestions ?  I need somewhere 2 go tomorrow
21	Here I am  @  The Empire State Building ,  I love NYC ;  Gnomes are treated well here .  Plus ,  I love Pizza !  
21	Just got to NYC ,  crossing the Hudson River was kind of gross .  Ill upload some pics tomorrow ,  now to find a gigantic NYC bagel ! 
21	It was tough leaving Gnomeville ,  but the Journey must continue .  Im currently making way through New York ;  I should be in NYC by sunrise .  .  .  . 
21	Heres a pic of myself ,  along with my Brothers and Cousins .  Being in Gnomeville was nice ,  but the Journey must … 
21	I went home and got my new Hat ,  it looks just like my old one .  We almost have 300 followers ,  the Journey is growing more epic by the day ! 
21	 @ MorganCline  -  I dont have a  " Gnome - mobile "  ,  I teleport everywhere .  We have many powers ,  not 2 mention I would need a pretty large car ! 
21	I just got word from Gnomeville ,  my new hat just arrived .  Ill be heading home to pick it up ,  our Journey will continue tomorrow .  . 
21	The Worlds Largest Ball Of Twine has been nice ,  however there is not much to do in Cawker City ,  Kansas .  Today is a new day ,  where to go ?  ? 
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  It was very nice ,  thanks for the suggestion ! 
21	Today I am  @  The Worlds Largest Ball Of Twine ,  I had to shrink a bit for this one !  
21	What a refreshing night ,  we are so close to having 300 followers .  The Journey needs more people ,  hitting 300 will surely help us move on ! 
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  Thats a good idea ,  perhaps tomorrow ! 
21	Here I am  @  The Alamo ,  this will be a good place to rest for the day .  Do yall know why this is a historic place ?  
21	The Journey has been quite magical so far ,  yesterday we visited Mount Rushmore ,  past and present .  Today is a whole new day ,  where to go ? 
21	 @ TezThunderpunch  -  Thanks ,  I surely do have some Sunblock in my satchel .  Gnomes tan easily ,  were often confused for Mexignomes . 
21	And here I am back  @  Mount Rushmore in the Present day ,  I can only time travel for short amounts of time .  
21	I time travelled back to when Mount Rushmore was being built ;  quite fascinating .  And yes ,  all Gnomes can time t… 
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  All Excellent Suggestions ,  perhaps Mount Rushmore would be interesting .  .  .  .  .  . 
21	The Grand Canyon has been nice ,  today I will rest up ;  tonight I will continue our Journey ,  perhaps I will head East ,  any suggestions ? 
21	Twitter wont let me follow more than 2 , 000 people ;  unless I get more Followers ,  apparently its a ratio issue .  The Gnome needs more people ! 
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  Gnomes have frequently visited the Grand Canyon for a long time ,  theres more to it ;  but youd have to be a Gnome to know
21	 @ chrisbrown  -  Your music is listened to back in Gnomeville ,  we all dig it as well ;  and gigantic garden gnomes can be picky about their music
21	 @ labellavita _ 7  -  I noticed you have been re - tweeting my updates ,  thanks for being Gnome Friendly and joining the epic journey ! 
21	Here I am the Grand Canyon ,  interesting Gnome fact :  weve always called it the  " Gnome Canyon "  .  
21	Today I will be exploring the Grand Canyon ,  I went there as a young Gnome .  Also ,  Thanks to  @ freemefromtampa for the suggestion yesterday ! 
21	I want to take a minute and thank all of my followers ,  we are now officially up to 244 people ;  I get stronger with every follower ! 
21	R . I . P .  Dennis Hopper , I once had the honor of joining him for a game of Racquet Ball .  He was a fierce competitor .  
21	 @ xXSuperJudeXx  -  Pyramids are amazing ,  for years it was thought that Gnomes had a hand in the design .  However ,  we merely gave them some tips
21	Here I am at Chichen Itza ,  Gnomes spent a lot of time here in the Early Postclassic Period .  
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  Its funny you mention that ,  my cousin works for a travel agency ;  he suggested I go there as well ,  on my way now ! 
21	New Mexico has been nice ,  its almost time to move on .  Where shall I go next ? 
21	R . I . P .  Gary Coleman ,  I once met him while posing as a human .  Heres the pic ,  he was always very Gnome Friendly .  
21	Here is a pic of me entering New Mexico ,  some local people posed with me ;  kind of an overcast day .  .  .  .  
21	 @ MorganCline  -  Ur right about David the Gnome ,  he is a prick ,  he still owes me 12 Gnome Dollars . Lisa is nice ,  but I dont see them anymore . 
21	That was a good night of rest ,  The Valley Of Fire is peaceful .  The Journey continues ,  perhaps I can help stop the oil spill in the Gulf .  .  .  .  . 
21	Time to rest in The Valley Of Fire ,  Gnomes have camped here for centuries .  
21	I assumed the identity of a local man to gamble ,  just one of my many special powers !  
21	Here I am  @  the Stratosphere ,  I was apparently too big to bungee jump off the top .  
21	Here I am  @  the New York New York ,  geez ;  it even makes me look small !  
21	Heres a pic of when I got to Vegas ,  every Gnome out there should check this place out ;  its worth the trip !  
21	Ahh Vegas was nice ,  Ill upload the pics tomorrow .  The Journey has been fun so far ,  where shall I go next is the question ? 
21	luckily I was able to find a Twitter station in Vegas ,  finding a room large enough for a Gnome was tough .  .  .  .  .  . pics to come soon ! 
21	The next leg of our Journey may be difficult ,  and I may not be able to Tweet for a little while ;  rest assured though ,  Ill be back soon
21	 @ freemefromtampa  -  Perhaps ,  only time will tell . 
21	The Worlds Largest Gnome should have the Worlds Largest Amount Of Followers On Twitter ,  then we might be able to make it into Outerspace ! 
21	 @ RealTamiFarrell  -  Thanks ! 
21	Back  @  the Golden Gate Bridge ,  time to rest .  Weve got a big day tomorrow ,  perhaps well check out Vegas !  
21	The Medicinal Marijuana out here is amazing ,  beats anything we got back home in Gnomeville .  Yes ,  I live in a place named Gnomeville  :   ) 
21	 @ xXSuperJudeXx  -  Gnomes can shrink ,  but only after being in the water .  Ill try sticking my hand in ,  hopefully they accept Gnome Cash
21	I found a Medical Marijuana Shop ,  the tricky part will be getting inside .  Check out the pic I just had taken !  
21	Woke up early and headed to the Golden Gate Bridge ,  San Francisco Is Beautiful .  
21	Sleeping alone in the Redwoods is freaky ,  I just heard something off in the distance ,  hopefully its not a rival Gnome .  Tomorrow ,  San Fran ! 
21	The rest of the Journey will be hard with out at least a 100 followers ,  the Redwoods are a tough place to get out of .  We only need 3 more !  ! 
21	Send me a direct message and let me know where to go ,  being a huge Garden Gnome can get lonely .  .  .  . 
21	The Redwoods are nice ,  where should I go next ? 
21	Woke up early and headed to the Redwoods .  
21	Time for sleep ,  Redwoods tomorrow .  Sure would be nice to have a 100 followers by morning ,  the Journey has only just begun . 
21	Tomorrow my Journey will lead us to the Redwoods ,  hopefully I wont run into any rival Gnomes along the way ;  the Redwood Gnomes can be tough
21	Hollywood has been nice , I tried not stepping on anyone ,  some guy asked me for change ;  but he didnt want to climb up  &  get it . 
21	Here I am at the Hollywood Sign !  
21	Ive started my Journey ,  more followers will make me strong .  Incase you didnt notice ,  Im huge and walk slowly .  Ill be in Hollywood Today ! 
21	Ahh ,  that was a good night of rest .  Today will be the first day of my Journey ,  where should I go first .  .  . any suggestions ? 
21	My hat is nice and sharp now ,  the anticipation of this Journey has been overwhelming .  Time for a good night of rest ,  Gnomes have to sleep to
21	Tomorrow will be a good day to start the Journey ,  I must spend this evening sharpening the point on my hat ;  A Gnome has to protect himself
