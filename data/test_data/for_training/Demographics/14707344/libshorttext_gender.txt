-1	 @ ECL1983 me too .  Only an idiot would sign up for 9 weeks of night shifts for that .  .  .  ! 
-1	Long ,  long time since I was waking up at this hour .  Anyone got a forklift to help get me out of bed ? 
-1	 @ michaelhortin itll only be an hour of it at this rate .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ WildeV You love it really .  MWAH . 
-1	Can this count as a 1 - man collapse ? 
-1	 @ greg _ jenner Arthur Conan - Doyles ideas ? 
-1	 @ jeanemcc I am saving cash ,  am going for a run tomorrow  ( 3rd day running )  and am going to watch Jools .  Sod it . 
-1	I still think well be all out for 36 . 
-1	Ah ,  I miss writing  # Trottfacts
-1	 @ ecl1983 As I suspected  -  worst batting tour ever .  Bowling not great either . 
-1	Jimmy ,  you beauty
-1	 @ Megfdavies  @ Aggerscricket Not me !  I retweeted it a day ago from an Aussie  -   @ mspr1nt should get credit . 
-1	Rankin is already more fun than just about anyone else in this series . 
-1	What a khazi . 
-1	 @ ssalaga thanks Steve  -  that was really interesting !  Cheers
-1	What ,  no Ashes ?   # relief
-1	 @ olicollett if only ! 
-1	 @ georgeyboy Youd have been better off getting up early and grabbing a session before work .  .  . 
-1	 @ michaelhortin Problem is ,  who replaces him .  Only player guaranteed to be in team at moment is Broad .  .  .  who cant do everything . 
-1	Perfect reading post night shift .  .  .  .  ‚Äú @ brainpicker :  How sleep deprivation decays the mind and body

-1	At this rate itll all be over in 90 minutes . 
-1	 @ shetankabubalo it was good !  I need to watch some more .  .  . 
-1	Whomever it was ,   # Pomnishambles deserves to trend . 
-1	 @ olicollett Only cos you havent delivered any . 
-1	 @ ECL1983 excellent suggestion .  Happy new year ! 
-1	 @ legsidelizzy was the whole series plan predicated on them winning the toss  & amp ;  batting first each time ? 
-1	 @ TimPeachBBC England should have extra points deducted for this performance .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ Crawf33 very good !  It just took a bit of getting used to the graphics .  .  .  But I liked the nods to the real stories . 
-1	 @ Tony _ Zielinski Hello  -  I work  @ bbc5live in UK .  Wed like an interview about cheese brine !  Could you email me a number ?  upallnight @ bbc . co . uk
-1	 @ WISN12News Hi  -  I work  @ bbc5live .  Trying to find a reporter to talk about cheese brine !  Is there a number I can call ?  Upallnight @ bbc . co . uk
-1	 @ legsidelizzy as you know ,  Im critical ,  but those ratings too harsh .  Broad excellent .  Rankin at least turned up .

-1	 @ nickwallis Stansfield ?  I was having a similar thought . 
-1	 @ Crawf33  @ AfterGrogBlog thats all weve got close to winning this winter . 
-1	KP on to bowl ahead of Borthwick ?  I just dont get that at all . 
-1	 @ hdotjones quest que ce ?  BA BA BA BAA BA BA
-1	 @ rakenny67  @ judyfladmark I watched Sherlock the other night going thats the wrong type of train for that track .  I need a life . 
-1	 @ mikewills _ sport completely agree
-1	Even against an England side in form ,  this Australia side might have won the series .  But England have set a new bar in woefulness . 
-1	That is going to hurt .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ ssalaga My email :  upallnight @ bbc . co . uk .  Thanks ! 
-1	 @ legsidelizzy Bit hard on anyone to shift around the order that much ,  let alone a newbie
-1	 @ LettersOfNote Hi Shaun  -  just got your book .  An absolute treat  -  it looks beautiful too .  Well done / thanks ! 
-1	 @ ecl1983 rubbish ! 
-1	 @ judyfladmark Id make a joke ,  but my heart really isnt in it .  Sad .

-1	I love  @ jimmaxcricket . 
-1	 @ blaqkgloss you are the only person on my timeline not talking about cricket ! 
-1	 @ legsidelizzy This series has been a selectorial shambles par excellence
-1	 @ jeanemcc its only on for the music .  A small  ( double )  whisky to welcome in the new year too .  Have a good one lovely ! 
-1	 @ timoncheese  " he really does need a good shoeing sometimes "  is quite an apt way of putting it . 
-1	Oh Kevin . 
-1	Welcoming in 2014 with whisky donated by  @ jonabuft  & amp ;   @ kateru ,  Jools on telly  & amp ;  toast with bread donated by  @ NickWoodsford isnt bad really . 
-1	 @ JohnSunCricket  @ legsidelizzy or KP .  .  .   ( though I hope not ,  because hes still our best player by miles .  .  .  ) 
-1	Well that was a good start . 
-1	Excellent .  .  .  .   * rubs hands Burns - style * 
-1	 @ jameshmm is that the same theory I used when I said I was going to target Scarlett Johansson ? 
-1	 @ WildeV you  & amp ;  me both kid .  At least theres cricket .  .  . 
-1	 @ judyfladmark knew I should have restrained myself from tweeting a bad joke ! 
-1	 @ AndreaLisher  :  -  )  congratulations  ( but you have my commiserations for the night shifts ahead ) 
-1	 @ Crawf33 sadly apt ! 
-1	 @ legsidelizzy haha !  Fair point  ! 
-1	 @ GeorgeDobell1 excellent piece ,  George
-1	 @ AndreaLisher youre just excited about listening to my editing of Up All Night arent you ?  Go on ,  admit it . 
-1	 @ timaviss was it a yule log that caused the problem ? 
-1	 @ gemgemloulou  @ legsidelizzy Even as The Doctor hed be hiding behind the sofa at this . 
-1	The slogging tactic this morning worked well then .  .  . 
-1	 @ jameshmm I bet shes a bloody good swinger
-1	 @ jonabuft TOFFS TOFFS TOFFS TOFFS TOFFS
-1	 @ charissachad looks like the run will win !  Hope youre well x
-1	Theyve had some stick but that was excellent from England today .  Right .  Off to bed . 
-1	 @ jeanemcc we are ROCK N ROLL
-1	 @ michaelhortin  @ rodwhiting Theres no - one .  I should know ,  Im spending 9 weeks on night shifts so I can watch it all .  .  .   # madness
-1	 @ nickt103 give it 2 years ,  team :  Cook ,  Root ,  Bell ,  KP ,  Ballance  ( or Robson )  ,  Stokes ,  Prior  ( or Buttler )  ,  Borthwick ,  Finn ,  Rankin
-1	Watching the cricket lowlights .  England will do anything to keep Ian Bell from batting at 3 ,  wont they ? 
-1	 @ michaelhortin I bet !  Do head over to Manchester soon .  .  . 
-1	 @ theanniemartin  @ jeanemcc  * applauds * 
-1	My current state of mind  # Ashes :  
-1	Still ,  friends are forged in defeat .  To all whove been up with me for the last few weeks ,  I salute  & amp ;  commend you .  Mostly for your bravery . 
-1	 @ michaelhortin  @ rodwhiting Judging by my batting in the nets recently ,  that would not be a good idea .  .  .   # howzat
-1	 @ arranrp Well if you wont move to the glorious north .  .  . 
-1	 @ stuartclarkson that spelling was double - checked before it went to air .  .  . 
-1	 @ ECL1983 Ah  -  then enjoy !  There might be  -  weve still to bat ,  so youve got at least 20 minutes .  .  . 
-1	 @ jamiefox1 Hi Jamie  -  James  @ bbc5live .  Know you spoke to colleagues earlier but wed like an interview later .  Still available ?  Thanks
-1	 @ GeorgeDobell1 Im asking you all !  Hoping to sort a a round - table discussion .  Im assuming youre there  -  could we get you to 5 live point ? 
-1	 @ Sarahdcf Urgh .  Flu is proper rubbish .  If its any help I am off to the gym .  Madness .

-1	 @ greg _ jenner aha .  I shall investigate .  .  . 
-1	 @ WildeV absolutely .  Id say I prefer cricket nowadays ,  but .  .  . 
-1	 @ niftysue  @ michaelhortin Utter madness .  Im on nine weeks of night shifts for this . 
-1	 @ ECL1983 You need to stop watching English batting .  In other news ,  have a drink ,  thatll help . 
-1	 @ plalor Sure  -  all set to change given imminent Aussie win !  Are you at the ground ?  Obviously have your number but could go to 5 live point ? 
-1	 @ legsidelizzy sphinx ? 
-1	 @ TimPeachBBC even better .  Its been a proper catastro - insert swear word here
-1	 @ WildeV nope .  Lardies . 
-1	‚Äú @ iandeeley :   @ JamesWickham always the womens .  .  .  . ‚Äù YES !  Proper cricket will still be had this winter !   # phew

-1	 @ jameshmm a whole 12 inch one should be fine .  Fnarr . 
-1	Bet Cooks quite pleased its all over really . 
-1	 @ iandeeley YES !  Some proper sport  & amp ;  actual competition to come ! 
-1	 @ ItsMarkWebster He should belt it ,  a la Warner .  No point being timid in abject defeat .  .  . 
-1	 @ ECL1983 1 )  KP was brought on to bowl ahead of Borthwick ,  which doesnt make much sense to me .  2 )  That was a nice pic you tweeted earlier . 
-1	I still think itd be a bit harsh to drop Carbs after this series . 
-1	 @ CharlotteFoster but on the plus side ,  they make you sound like a helicopter ! 
-1	 @ judyfladmark name of new channel ?  CBoobies ?  Ill get my coat . 
-1	 @ TimPeachBBC urgh .  Even if theres not much batting left .  .  .  Really ?  Oh well .  I suppose its just the way he plays .  .  . 
-1	 @ theanniemartin  @ jeanemcc musics on ,  I have whisky  & amp ;  toast .  Pretty much spot on ,  I reckon .  .  . 
-1	 @ ItsMarkWebster and of course ,  Rogers is 36 now .  .  . 
-1	 @ ItsMarkWebster absolutely ,  but needs to play his own game
-1	 @ simon _ kelsey quite agree .  Clarke is class .  Other than that .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ ECL1983 I bet .  Still you wangled us a wicket by waking up so Ill take that .  Have a brew  & amp ;  settle down for an interesting session ! 
-1	 @ WildeV It is as quiet as a mute mouse wearing slippers
-1	 @ niftysue wine . 
-1	 @ sharonsimcock was each one of them a drink of some sort ? 
-1	 @ olicollett Neither do I .  Producing a round table on 5 live at 4 . 45am so hopefully get some insights then ! 
-1	 @ WildeV have been for 3 hours .  .  . 
-1	Someone will have to explain that to me . 
-1	Yesterday decided January sobriety didnt include wine .  Today ,  drank 4 pints .  Shambles . 
-1	This is delightful stuff ,  but I fear it means well be 36 all out . 
-1	The most worrying bit of this performance is that Cook patently doesnt trust Monty enough to even give him a go . 
-1	 @ niftysue  @ michaelhortin cheese  & amp ;  chips ?  Thats definitely taking it seriously . 
-1	 @ timaviss toilet roll ? 
-1	 @ RhiRhi _ 98 Ja ,  ich kann hilfen mit dat .  Or something .
