11	 @ allytokyo Proper shorts and sandals weather ! 
11	 @ GC _ ChrisReeves They make most of their programs dramatic .  Documentaries ,  hell ,  even those shitty reality shows about pawn shops ,  etc .

11	 @ Vazkii Im not sure that there is a direct alternative
11	 @ allytokyo I wonder whatll happen in 2 .  Theyll probably ruin it like Paranormal Activity ,  etc . 
11	One of the chimneys has fallen ,  leaving four holes in the roof .  Splendid . 
11	The Minecraft modding community can be horrendously toxic sometimes .  What an absolute turn - off .

11	 @ allytokyo Lets hope 2014 brings on the crows feet !   : D

11	To bed ?  Hmmmm .  The almost constant yawning might be some sort of signal ! 
11	My current shower music is the Guild Wars 2 soundtrack .  Nothing like a bit of Jeremy Soule to lather oneself to  : D
11	On my way back to Durham .  Toodles Newcastle ! 
11	 @ knoxee I wouldve flipped my shit ,  literally .  Things wouldve been broken .  Walls smashed .  People obliterated .
