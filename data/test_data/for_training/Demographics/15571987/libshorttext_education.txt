2	Great stuff .  Make change dont moan :   @ tes :  Forget the bleak educational midwinter and summon the spirit of teaching 
2	Shocked re roof collapse  @   # ApolloTheatre Shaftesbury Ave .  How is this possible ?  Nimax owned ,  productions in ,  who does the maintenance ?   # h & amp ; s

2	this  # ToughYoungTeachers is a documentary following 6  @ TeachFirst teachers in their first year of teaching ,  on BBC3 9 Jan  @  9pm ,  8 weeks .

2	 .  .  . its ok to have a crap day now and again .  Ive learnt a lot from the things Ive not done well .

2	willingly replaying being 11 again watching Disneys joyous Little Mermaid .  love it .  only age  /  experience wishes theyd kept the glass in . 
2	suppose Id just roundhouse kick a window and scale down the side of the building like spiderman .  hmm .  time to call it a day ,  I reckon . 
2	also ,  the fire alarm at TF towers is a bit odd  -  a fire has been detected ,  stay where you are .  confusing . 
2	staying late doing some calls to  @ TeachFirst ambassadors from the 11 cohort .  best time for the fire alarm to go off ,  thanks for that . 
2	time for some  @ TeachFirst community website induction - ness with  @ KalSajad .  need to start writing ,  not just reading .

2	Im utterly convinced by the power of just 1 person to make the change they want to see .  I just wish I could apply this to the washing up . 
2	Spring in step after long say .  Ended with a couple of hugely inspiring conversations with 11 Ambassadors  @ TeachFirst .  Changemakers all . 
2	 @ chrishall03 agree  -  not enough of the how and too much retrospective back - patting  -  which makes the politics cloud the results . 
2	 @ Mitchell _ Nat that choon never gets old .  rerewind .  craig david ! 
2	terrible times :  accidental tiger balm ache to eye cross contamination .  worse than onions but better than actual crying . 
2	 @ Mitchell _ Nat and the crowd say .  .  .  ?

2	if Enron thumbed its nose at capitalistic nihilism ,   # APmusical roundhouse kicks it in the bollocks .  nicely done  @ rupertgoold
2	 .  .  . ENAL !   & lt ;  -  -   # APmusical pt2 .  phenom + enal  =  go axe an investment banker for a ticket .   [ no ,  dont ,  but do try to see it .  a cert to transfer ]

2	 @ ThatGeoffChap dude ,  be selective and careful of your sources . 
2	be the chuffing change you want to see .  terms like idealism are coined to rein you in .  break stuff . 
2	people laugh this off as idealistic therefore unachievable  -  rot .  get involved ,  stop lamenting poor management and work / life culture . 
2	work hard and be nice . apply to every moment of every day .  push yourself to be the best you can be ,  with every person you come across
2	meet - up for 03 Ambassadors  @ TeachFirst London office tonight .  looking forward to meeting some of 1st cohort  & amp ;  hearing where theyre at now .

2	 @ Rachel _ deSouza cant wait to hear this  -  needs shouting about .  hope it goes well ,  will be listening ! 
2	 @ mzendle most of the coverage Ive heard  ( yeah yeah radio 4 )  hasnt labelled  -  just said hes in a relationship with a ( nother )  man . 
2	 .  .  . also slightly shoddy bbc news journalism for not drawing critical attention to this ?  News is not a book club ! 
2	bit cynical re Andrew Lloyd Webbers involvement in this whole Profumo / Ward clearing names campaign .  Doesnt he have a certain show opening ? 
2	go Tom Daley .  what a brilliant message but shame he had to make it . 
2	Boris Johnson in a bra could pull Billy Mitchell .   # eastenders  # excellent
2	 @ Weez boo .  Ive got other plans now  ( cleverly dbl - booked self )  .  sorry !  !  hope you can find someone else .  new job is great  -  fast paced world ! 
2	 @ ThatGeoffChap  @ clouddancefest there is some disbelief going on . 
2	 @ clouddancefest  @ ThatGeoffChap I bloody hope not .  apparently my better half is at waterloo .  yet he had phone signal  # skeptical
2	 @ clouddancefest a loooooong evening of waiting for  @ ThatGeoffChap to circumnavigate the tube map appears to be in the offing .  want to swap ?

2	Community Engagement Team Day ahoy !   @ TeachFirst  ( hope everyones impressed by my East London themed snacks ) 
2	 @ TeacherLady83 cheers !  Its my first week ,  lots to take in .  not TF but about tackling educational equality ,  so you are def part of it !   :  )
