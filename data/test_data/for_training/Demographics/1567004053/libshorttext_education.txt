3	 @ JuveFC1897 That could be interesting .  FIFA ? 
3	Here comes Artur Petrosyan again . 
3	 @ callumta Anything to report recently happening to you while playing Manager Mode on FIFA 14 ?  I made a howler ,  signed Portos Fernando  ( 1 / 2 ) 
3	 @ LFCFansCorner Every time ,  Mascherano . 
3	 @ JuveFC1897 Cheers !  Ill probably be another 2 hours ,  sorry ,  just stuck a film on . 
3	 @ btsport Good .  Hes a disgrace ,  shouldnt have played another game after he was stripped of captaincy . 
3	Napoli want Pepe Reina on a long - term deal 
3	 @ LivEchonews  @ Getintothis An - twa - key ;  to describe something as old - fashioned or outdated .   # ScouseSayings
3	 @ momolga4ever Looks like its going to be another title .  We are in a league of our own . 
3	 @ MaxLFC _  Moncalieri ,  a little commute near Turin .   :  -  ) 
3	 @ knoxville1971 CoD  & lt ;  Battlefield  & lt ;  Killzone .  Okay ,  thanks ! 
3	 @ alex _ corns Probably collateral from one of my wipes .  Ever so often Ill auto - unfollow people that fall through certain filters .  Buggy . 
3	 @ 0point5twins Clever ! 
3	 @ MrScripto Blerh .  Details . 
3	 @ callumta only to use him in a trade in the very next window for Rubin Kazans MVila !   ( Ive also parted with Lucas )  .   ( 2 / 2 ) 
3	 # PSN :  SanguineousROSSO .  I play mainly on  # FIFA 14 ,   # GTA 5 and Ill be on  # Battlefield 4 soon if anyone fancies connecting . 
3	And after shouts of  * Barkley  & gt ;  Lukaku *  and  * Baines  & gt ;  Lukaku *  Im off . 
3	 @ MrBoywunder That cross from Sterling . 
3	 @ ADP1113 Agreed .  Frustrating .  When he came to Liverpool ,  directly from Roma ,  he looked physically drained ,  a shadow of the player he was . 
3	 @ saxtonmac1990 Brought in Wilshere for Giacc and Im saving for Ramires to replace Diaby .   # GoodShout
3	 # RIPJamesAvery
3	 @ andy123webs Same here .  Its difficult when the ball doesnt roll straight away like it has / does for players like Sturridge . 
3	 @ RedsOrDead  # RedOrDead
3	David  # Trezeguet :   " The fans dream of seeing me return to Juve ?  For 6 months ?  Tell me where to sign and Ill do it right now .  " 
3	 @ ADP1113 He ticked almost every box for us to replace Xabi Alonso too .  One of footballs great mysteries . 
3	Gwed Iago .  RT  @ LFC :  Team v Hull :  Mignolet ,  Johnson ,  Cissokho ,  Skrtel ,  Agger ,  Lucas ,  Henderson ,  Coutinho ,  Aspas ,  Sterling ,  Suarez . 
3	 @ andy123webs And yeah ,  it should go live soon . 
3	 @ bboyer30 I was watching Southampton the other day and they sounded like a broken record .  Then I watched Spurs .  .  .  It did get quite tedious . 
3	If ya fancy it :  
3	 @ thisisanfield Bella . 
3	 @ LFCFansCorner Good lad . 
3	 @ andy123webs Saw that ,  haha .  Its always nice to see your name around the internet .   ;  -  ) 
3	Game .  Set .  Match .  Finito . 
3	 @ alex _ corns Its a shame .  Hell probably join PSG in July . 
3	 @ JackSear How great will it be having two first - team - class midfield players who play in the same position ? 
3	 @ RabroubLFC Cheers . 
3	 @ raquelburritos Haha !  To the tune of Music Man .  Iago Aspas . 
3	Like the majority of people watching that ,  I already knew he had scored that before he hit it .   # Suárez
3	 @ RedsOrDead Hungover !  Haha .  Regardless ,  Im up ! 
3	 @ MR11ok Feliz cumpleaños !   # YNWA
3	Haha !  Swansea !  1 - 0 up against United .  Routledge . 
3	 @ asbo1970 Ill probably go for Battlefield to be honest ,  I really enjoyed BF3 compared to CoD :  MWII .  Okay ,  Ill add you .  SanguineousROSSO . 
3	 @ MoleyBTK Just sent you the report on Tello now mate . 
3	 @ andy123webs Thats the fella ! 
3	 @ dazzg Was thinking of swerving Ox ,  thanks for the suggestions ! 
3	 # LFCs Mamadou Sakho has a  " good chance "  of returning from injury to play against  # SCFC .   (  @ physioroom ) 
3	Would love for Aspas to get a goal today . 
3	 @ ElPratto _   @ ElmoRed2011 Agreed .  Games at this level are the only chance hes going to start ,  and get game experience ,  right now . 
3	 @ RedsOrDead Argh .  I hope Wisdom picks up some good habits from his loan at Derby .  Frustrating to watch last season . 
3	 @ MaxLFC _  Sfacciato . 
3	The best player to play for Everton in a decade is a loanee . 
3	Il bene più segreto sfugge alluomo che non guarda avanti mai .   # Centoundici
3	 [ Outside of the UK ]  Here is a stream to LFCTVs coverage of the game .  
3	 @ CosmosHolidays Ive a holiday booked for June ,  going to Lanzarote ,  can you tell me the hand and hold baggage weight limits please ?  Thanks . 
3	 @ callumta Seen it mate haha .   ;  -  ) 
3	 @ andy123webs Haha ,  lazy journalism .  I didnt doubt the move for Salah until Artur stepped in !  What do you think of Mo Salah anyhow ? 
3	Thinking of getting a new game for the PlayStation .  Should I go for Call of Duty :  Ghosts or Battlefield 4 ?  Or something entirely different ? 
3	 @ ElPratto _  Hopefully ,  now we have Sakho ,  we hardly need Kolo .  He has been a good stand - in for Carra though . 
3	 # FinoAllaFineForzaJuventus
3	 @ RedsOrDead Ive heard ,  hopefully that continues when hes back here !  Huge prospect .  Mandem . 
3	 @ RockLeeSmile Happy New Year ,  Nick ! 
3	McGeady to Everton ,  huh ?  Probably the long - term version of Deulofeu .  I laughed for the entire time I spent writing that . 
3	 @ bboyer30 You can smile when singing along ,  haha ! 
3	 @ bboyer30 We had it a few years back in Ryan Babel .  Two players weve never replaced  -  the  " pitbull "  Mascherano and the  " super sub "  Babel . 
3	 @ JackSear Gerrard vs City . 
3	Bella .   # ForzaJuve !  
3	 @ ElPratto _  Its peculiar .  Youd imagine if Rodgers had no intention of playing him ,  hed loan him out ?  As you said ,  weve paid £7m for him . 
3	 @ ADP1113 I remember .  I was the guy defending him when other fans here were slating him .   " No ,  he is actually REALLY good .  " 
3	 @ Xolali  @ RadioCity967
3	 @ Luckybiyela Cheers ,  you too !  🎊
3	 @ LfcHub _ Streams Maybe thisll sit well ?   @ ray _ murph

3	 @ MaxLFC _  Ah ,  cool ,  fratello .   ; D
3	 @ LFCFansCorner Ahem . 
3	Jus one of those nights .  
3	 @ MrScripto Rooney left Everton 10 years ago this year . 
3	 @ hunter _ troll Tough one .  .  .  Owen ,  Mr Insightful . 
3	 @ ElPratto _  It was mentioned in Peter Guys  (  @ Getintothis )  rumour roundup on the Echos website .  
3	 @ bboyer30 Mm !  Mohamed Salah ,  not world class but .  .  .  against Chelsea we just needed a player to come off the bench and turn it around . 
3	 @ bboyer30 Forza la Juve la Juve la Juve ale ,  eBianconera la bella Signora ! 
3	 @ Cathy23carson This was the picture I was talking about 
3	 @ asbo1970 Which would you say offers the better  * realism *  ?  Like you could sit in a field with a sniper for 5 mins without getting stabbed . 
3	It couldnt last forever .   # BackToWork  # HolidaysAreOver 
3	Luis Suárez can leave Liverpool for £70m if they fail to qualify for the Champions League .   ( ECHO ) 
3	 @ Xolali Oh ,  youre in Ghana .  Right ,  96 . 7 dont stream match commentary over the net .  Music instead .  Try this :  
3	 @ UKILFC I remember this .  Tragic event .  The man is ,  not just in football but in life ,  an icon . 
3	Nakamuraaa !  !  RT  @ FootbalIVines :  What a bend !  
3	 @ LFCFansCorner Salah ,  Fernando / Matuidi and maybe Tello / Rakitić ,  that may be pushing it though . 
3	 @ LFCFansCorner Standard . 
3	 @ jfm1993 Makes sense .  Unfair to United to throw that about .  Wouldnt 1 - 2 get bad karma .  .  . 
3	 @ bboyer30 Haha !  I was thinking CM ,  Giaccherini and Diaby arent the most formidable partnership . 
3	 @ LFCFansCorner Gah !  I was happy reading that until I saw Daily Star . 
3	Assaidi  & gt ;  Moses . 
3	 @ andy123webs Particularly this season ,  Roma have been brilliant .  Itll be a tough one .  Definitely one of the most exciting Italian fixtures ! 
3	 @ andy123webs Insane .  Ive always said if a channel like 5 ,  or anybody mopped up the games that werent televised ,  they would rake it in . 
3	 @ andy123webs Buon Anno ! 
3	 @ Thomas _ LFC _ 99 Whod you suggest ?  Going for a Premier League squad if you havent already guessed . 
3	United at 1 - 1 .  Hernandez . 
3	 @ bboyer30  @ Squawka  @ cjfox21 Our squad is far too thin as it is and January will be over before we even realise . 
3	 @ ray _ murph If I come across any Ill link you up . 
3	 @ Danielfils Salah is almost certain to sign according to numerous sources ,  Tello is possible  ( loan )  and Ian Ayre has been to France (  ?  )  . 
3	 @ bboyer30 Good shout !  Might go for Chelseas Ramires if I can afford him .  Cheers . 
3	 @ ElPratto _  Stoke to further toughen him up or Swansea to help him play with fluidity .  Yeah ,  he was quite the small blip on the radar before . 
3	 @ OnTheBeachUK I certainly will as soon as you guys follow .  Thanks ! 
3	 @ Danielfils Apparently all agreed but not from any reputable sources as of yet . 
3	Liverpool winning 2 - 0 against Oldham .  Sterling with a goal and an assist ,  Aspas with a goal and an assist . 
3	 @ juanmata10 José has been treating you badly ,  Juan .  But I know someone who would hold you during the cold evenings .  
3	 @ royaleneal Check my Tweet before that one .  No visual today ,  unfortunately ,  just audio . 
3	 @ Kev92Kelly Blaine  & gt ;  Sherlock  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  & gt ;  darts . 
3	Welcome to 2014 !   # rain 
3	 @ Green _ Scouser Wouldnt mind asking Stoke if they want Moses instead and well have Assaidi back . 
3	 @ LiverpoolWord Highly unlikely but if Suárez fancied a move abroad ,  yes . 
3	I knew thered be an injury today ,  thats the magic of the FA Cup for you . 
3	 @ ElPratto _  That being considered ,  I think a loan to a fellow Premier League team would be beneficial .  Stoke ,  ideally . 
3	 @ TheBibTheorists Rodgers will be fuming in the dressing room at half time . 
3	Sturridge expected to return in 7 - 10 days  
3	I get Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson mixed up an embarrassing amount of times . 
3	 @ D _ Sturridge Cant wait to have you back on the pitch Daniel ! 
3	 @ Squawka  @ cjfox21 Its rare I disagree with Callum but it would be foolish for Liverpool to sell ANY players in January . 
3	Quite an interesting picture Ive just found of Mamadou Sakho .  .  .  
3	 @ OOTB _ football Nice ,  informative piece Sami .   :  -  ) 
3	Liverpool and QPR are battling it out to land Napoli starlet Armando  # Anastasio ,  according to reports in Italy 
3	 @ DJNoreenKhan Nope ,  tend to favourite Tweets I like but arent quite good enough to get a Retweet . 
3	 @ MaxLFC _  No .  Born in Liverpool but I have Italian family ,  can read and write a bit of it .  A hit and miss with speaking it ,  haha . 
3	 @ CosmosHolidays Ive just done that .  Thanks . 
3	 @ MoleyBTK Yep ,  thats ideal .  Ill have it to you Friday night . 
3	Todays predictions : Juventus 2  -  1 Roma . Liverpool 3  -  0 Oldham . 
3	 @ grantjennings Youre right !  Whoops . 
3	 @ asbo1970 Cheers ! 
3	 @ beamng Will you guys be putting your brilliant game on mobile devices in the future ? 
3	 @ OnTheBeachUK Ive a holiday booked ;  June ,  Lanzarote ,  flying w / Cosmos ,  can you tell me the hand  & amp ;  hold baggage weight limits please ?  Thanks . 
3	 @ JuveFC1897 Sound ,  speak to you then .  Back to the game ! 
3	 @ MaxLFC _  Nope ,  Ive never actually visited Italy .  Why ?  I do plan on in the future though . 
3	Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard set for early injury returns 
3	 @ andy123webs This is as much as Ive heard :  
3	Antonio Di Natale has announced that he will retire at the end of the current Serie A season . 
3	H A P P Y  N E W  Y E A R  ! 
3	IA - IA - IAGO IAGO IAGO
3	 @ callumta Indeed .  Cant wait for more Daughtry ! 
3	Prediction :  A bold 4 - 0 win for Liverpool against Hull with goals from Suárez  ( 2 )  ,  Sterling and Aspas !  Just hope the defence bucks up today . 
3	Suárez broke another Premier League record again today by taking the fewest amount of games  ( 15 )  to score 20 goals .
