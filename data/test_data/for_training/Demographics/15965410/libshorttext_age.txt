-0.48	Of course John beat me to this .  RT  @ jbtaylor :   @ PastorAmyDC We need to check on their survey methodology .

-0.48	 @ GoTeamMegan and none of the Southerners giving you the evil eye are us .  So ,  generalizations . 
-0.48	 @ GoTeamMegan to be fair ,  the number of looks I see NYers giving anyone with a Southern accent doesnt really help . 
-0.48	 @ abumuqawama Hanging out with the astronaut with whom hes attending the Village People reunion show .  Clearly .

-0.48	 @ catclo and Nickel Creek is always worth a good binge . 
-0.48	 @ catclo last time I saw him ,  though ,  he was definitely in early stages of creeping out .   :  )

-0.48	Guess this means no Rocky Top !   # stillchasing RT  @ Phish _ FTR Scent Of A Mule
-0.48	I pray for peace above all .
