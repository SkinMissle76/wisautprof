1	 @ dtearl this .  Also ,  evil Nemanja is evil . 
1	There is a pretender to the Nemanja name !  This is not okay . 
1	 @ dtearl  @ GWcolonialhoops as an alumnus of both these schools ,  I must say that Rack Em is pretty great .  Also ,   # raisehigh . 
1	 @ GoTeamMegan Benghazi ? 
1	 @ carigervin I once thought Willie Mae was real ,  but the shtick is getting outlandish .  That said ,  satire in the Chattanoogan ?  Its perfect . 
1	 @ dorieturner I have this vision of it being called Lochs when its Scottish salmon now .  Im pleased with this . 
1	 @ ButMadNNW HOORAY !  YOU WILL SUCCEED AT THIS !

1	And my IPhone rewards me for my optimism with  " Miracle at South Bend ,  "  the John Ward playcall of the 1991 Tennessee - Notre Dame game .

1	 @ DisneyHipsters I have no idea how this thought had not crossed my mind ,  but now Im sad .

1	 @ dtearl Im just saying :  Smith Center is missing a little something today ,  man .  Hope Cali is good ! 
1	 @ allysonrobinson Ha !  They invented cloaking technology years ago . 
1	 @ ClayTravisBGID the key here is you trying not to laugh when he said  " Maryland had to get it in the back door last week .  " 
1	Of course John beat me to this .  RT  @ jbtaylor :   @ PastorAmyDC We need to check on their survey methodology . 
1	 @ PastorAmyDC This survey confuses me .  34 percent of non - Christan millennials read Scripture on their cell phones ?  That seems .  .  .  very off . 
1	 @ MKPony The mustache alone . 
1	Always love an  @ rachelnoelj sighting on the metro ,  even in passing ! 
1	 @ BEImlay to her ,  it may be !  Also ,  dinner soon ? 
1	 @ dtearl As youll recall ,  such an event got me connected to  @ GWGeorge .  Rooting against the Lady Vols in Knoxville ?  That was freaking nuts . 
1	 @ dtearl Note :  singing the fight song by yourself at a sporting event will feel weird at first .  Just work through that . 
1	 @ carigervin I want to know more about this bacon peanut butter bomb .  Why would you eat marshmallows given that option ? 
1	 @ dtearl no ,  but its my evil twin ,  apparently ! 
1	 @ myramt he is squirreling that away for me !  I asked him to ! 
1	 @ myramt No .  Freaking .  Way .  Did we let him return them ? 
1	 @ Bravesmeme The real question :  when can we start watching baseball every night again ?   # hotstove
1	 @ duffellduffell I love you ,  JAD .  Unapologetically . 
1	 @ elakdawalla Hehe ,  I assure you ,  we are all champing at the bit to get back to work .  Its been three weeks since I could even check e - mail ! 
1	 @ elakdawalla As a fed PR guy ,  remember ,  as of yesterday ,  we werent even sure wed be working anytime soon !  Give us a day .   :  ) 
1	 @ allysonrobinson  @ duffellduffell No !  but in the mirror universe ,  instead of a goatee ,  I have really long sideburns . 
1	 @ duffellduffell  @ allysonrobinson In my reality ,  there was never a beardless Riker .  EVER . 
1	So ,   @ allysonrobinson ,  this may be of interest to you at the yard sale :  a set of Star Trek commemorative plates !  
1	Alas !  Sold !  RT  @ jaymay :  Todays featured item :  cat slippers !  Also ,  Im probably buying them for my wife .   # ssys 
1	Big Canadian football fan ?  We have the bag for you here at  # SSYS !  
1	Todays featured item :  cat slippers !  Also ,  Im probably buying them for my wife .   # ssys

1	Modular daisies ,  anyone ?  
1	I am officially inbound to  # ssys day one !  Ill be live - tweeting a yard sale today ,  so ,  be ready for that .  But it has really weird stuff ! 
1	 @ ajcbraves it was so loud just now you couldnt hear announcers on TBS .  He was screaming about being loud for TBS .  Mission accomplished ? 
1	 @ caitycaity My grandmother ,  who taught me poker ,  has yet to adequately convey the nuances of bingo to me . 
1	 @ Braves Washington ,  DC here !  No Natitude in sight !   # BeatLA
1	This helps .  RT  @ Vol _ Photos :  Upset about the Vols overtime loss ?  Well let this cheer you up .   # futureSmokey 
1	 @ ButMadNNW yeah ,  Im immediately asking whether this outfit also has such little regard for their clients privacy . 
1	 @ ButMadNNW did that actually happen ?  That is terrible . 
1	 @ DisneyHipsters any chance for Narcoossees ?  Post - dinner boat to MK is a beautiful thing . 
1	 @ xeni ITS TIME TO GOVERN ,  JESSE
1	I miss my hometown .  RT  @ chacousa :  Good Morning from beautiful Chattanooga TN !  Chaco is hanging with the team from  @ RockCreek all day . 
1	 @ wesrucker247 I mean ,  they  * did *  see what he can do . 
1	This .  RT  @ wesrucker247 :  Peterman sacked ,  fumbles .  Florida ball inside the Vols 10 .  Still liking this QB change ? 
1	 # TSA security theater is in full effect at Archives stop .  Much  " behavior detection "  voodoo .  So ,  you know ,  walk to Chinatown .  Or Fed Tri . 
1	How cool is  @ BulldogBeing ?  Didnt just give a ball to a kid at the dugout :  he gave him a bat .  Thats why we love him . 
1	 @ xeni Think of all the meth you could have been cooking ! 
1	 @ dorieturner THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT
1	 @ MKPony When we rode it last week ,  it felt  " off ,  "  but as an every - few - years visitor ,  I couldnt put a finger on it . 
1	 @ allysonrobinson I definitely just lold . 
1	My friend is live - tweeting Murder She Wrote .  RT  @ pint _ of _ awesome :  GET OUT OF MRS FLETCHERS WAY SHE WILL KNOCK A B * TCH DOWN !   # murdershewrote
1	 @ ClayTravisBGID too much money spent paying former coaches ? 
1	 @ dorieturner Indeed ! 
1	Taking the best route to Epcot .   # monorailorange 
1	 @ GoTeamMegan At least we can find common ground in the Safaris improvement .  We rode it yesterday and it was like an entirely different trip . 
1	 @ GoTeamMegan and none of the Southerners giving you the evil eye are us .  So ,  generalizations . 
1	 @ GoTeamMegan to be fair ,  the number of looks I see NYers giving anyone with a Southern accent doesnt really help . 
1	 @ abumuqawama Hanging out with the astronaut with whom hes attending the Village People reunion show .  Clearly . 
1	 @ caitycaity glad to see youve learned the West Virginia state motto so quickly ! 
1	 @ ButMadNNW Ugh . Im sorry the quests been so hard .  But it will happen ,  then the next thing and then this will be the past .  Youll get there ! 
1	 @ pint _ of _ awesome nope ,  but  @ MKPony has the most detailed ,  insightful blog about the history  ( and evolution )  of Walt Disney World ever ! 
1	 @ MKPony Thanks !  Shameful / joyful fact :  I will be enjoying my first  ( real )  Citrus Swirl tomorrow . 
1	 @ Lead _ Better I didnt realize Emory was playing tonight ! 
1	Tomorrow I go to Disney World for 1st time since following  @ MKPony  (  & amp ;  1st in 5 years )  I owe thanks for a new perspective on place I love ! 
1	Imagine being 33 !  RT  @ themoderngal :  As a 31 - year - old ,  I feel like I just need to go ahead ,  throw in the towel .  My lifetime has been wasted . 
1	 @ pint _ of _ awesome I love the hanky ,  but the tie ?  Too skinny !  When it comes to actual neckties ,  Im all about the power tie . 
1	Yes !  But the push - up contest is next .  RT  @ pint _ of _ awesome :   " Baby ,  I beat  @ myramt at arm wrestling .  "  Is this true ,   @ jaymay ? 
1	 @ RegalMovies Bummed you wouldnt open extra theatre for  @ Rifftrax at Ballston !  Saw at least 30 ppl trying to buy tix in 5 mins we waited . 
1	RT  @ postmetrogirl :   # Metro Silver Line test train derails 
1	 @ carigervin Newseum ,  amazing !  Go !  Spy Museum ,  meh .  Smithsonian Am .  Art .  / Natl portrait gallery across street is better ,  free . 
1	 @ themoderngal Amen to that .  Glad to know Im not alone in that predicament . 
1	 @ GoTeamMegan remember ,  they only do that if people are actually willing to buy it .   * that *  is the messed up part . 
1	 @ caitycaity Wow . 
1	So happy  @ hulagirltruck is at Gallery Place today !  So delicious .  And no bus ride required to get it ! 
1	 @ NoodlesinCHI I think it sounds pretty normal .  But I think we have the same issue here . 
1	 @ ogliz I did that twice last week .  First night it worked ,  second night :  fail . 
1	 @ PastorAmyDC  @ duffellduffell I dunno ,  Im two weeks in to wearing shorts to church ,  and Im loving every minute of it . 
1	This embarrasses me .  RT  @ acomak :  Braves fans ,  appreciate your passion .  Please stop using derogatory terms 4 women ,  or body parts ,  in replies
1	Only my beard clipper knows for sure .  RT  @ Lead _ Better :   @ Braves I found the doppelgänger to  @ BulldogBeing :   @ jaymay !  
1	This !  RT  @ Braves :  Clown move bro
1	 @ ButMadNNW the second third time is the charm ! 
1	 @ ButMadNNW Hee !  Im good for more than just stories of making a rear end of myself on cruise ships .   :  ) 
1	 @ ButMadNNW Yeah ,  they are now Web only .  Killed apps totally dead . 
1	 @ ButMadNNW Done !  Remember not to feel that surge of quiet confidence any faster than it takes to realize how well - prepared you are .   :  ) 
1	 @ ButMadNNW no !  I have been dealing with death of Tweetdeck and missing bunch of tweets .  Congrats ! 
1	 @ ButMadNNW reading you loud and clear !

1	 @ themoderngal  @ carigervin Same at Nats Park .  Always a line for Shake Shack . 
1	 @ duffellduffell its just people shouting at a replicator ! 
1	Overheard in the elevator :   " the girls got like 250 followers .  You have to respect that skill set .  " 
1	 @ ButMadNNW its cool .  We still love you .   :  ) 
1	 @ dtearl it was a very odd moment when I was no longer an administrator on the  @ UTKnoxville page .  Life as a modern PR guy . 
1	 @ catclo and Nickel Creek is always worth a good binge . 
1	 @ catclo last time I saw him ,  though ,  he was definitely in early stages of creeping out .   :  ) 
1	 @ catclo I was lucky and saw him before he got famous when he would do songwriter night things in Athens ! 
1	 @ catclo wait Im being dumb !  I made that a Nickel Creek song in my head ! 
1	 @ catclo Did you ever see them live ? 
1	 @ dcsportsbog  " I have a most delicious way for you to die ,  Mr .  Bond .  "   -  -  Orangefinger
1	 @ maggiekb1 which is crazy ,  because cheese - making is both a Top Story and World News . 
1	 @ PastorAmyDC Zookeeper . 
1	 @ xeni Weirdly that is exactly what I needed to see right now . 
1	 @ xeni that looks so much like bird shot . 
1	 @ tvoti full disclosure ,  Im sending that from the seats at a Phish concert ,  so .  .  .  I guess I practice what I preach ? 
1	 @ tvoti ultimately ,  its also just okay to like a show critics dont !  I think its easy  ( no offense )  to let that mean more than it does . 
1	Guess this means no Rocky Top !   # stillchasing RT  @ Phish _ FTR Scent Of A Mule
1	I pray for peace above all . 
1	 @ duffellduffell was that ever a real option ? 
1	 @ MKPony and the challenge is that its not being replaced with better things ,  if at all .  Im all for good change . 
1	 @ MrsDeMaria Ebullient ! 
1	 @ MaryBethIkard and when our state is more focused firing teachers than feeding starving kids in our own backyard !  Its painful .
