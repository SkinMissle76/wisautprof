2	I did wonder t‚Äôother day ‚Äúwhat if Brand New played HTD ? ‚Äù I thought it was unlikely .  I was clearly wrong .  
2	 @ Callum0510 well the apps are free but I can understand being annoyed with the lack of USB drive input . 
2	 @ zzarrillo regarding last night brand new show ?  Was it advertised as a D√©j√† show or just fans assuming ?
