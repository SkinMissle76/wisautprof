32	 @ bsmrocks is it on your store ? 
32	 @ noisyhearts although last time I saw them was in Rock City and I wasn‚Äôt entirely feeling it . 
32	Im surprised Sherwood has been given the job permanently at  # spurs .  Thoughts  @ olliexcore  @ swissbearclaw  ?

32	Just end this match already .  Its painful to watch .   # RAW
32	I did wonder t‚Äôother day ‚Äúwhat if Brand New played HTD ? ‚Äù I thought it was unlikely .  I was clearly wrong .  
32	 @ Callum0510 well the apps are free but I can understand being annoyed with the lack of USB drive input . 
32	 @ zzarrillo regarding last night brand new show ?  Was it advertised as a D√©j√† show or just fans assuming ? 
32	 @ HannahGillicker I got as far as downloading the app .  That was 2 months ago . 
32	Only good thing about this is that  @ HeymanHustle is back on  # wwe tv . 
32	ABDOUNNNNNN !   # NFFC
