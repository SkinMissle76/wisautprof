24	 @ nimrodio Hi there ,   @ TomSale and I can help ,  we are working on projects for primary kids .  Send me an email  :  )  lespounder at gmail dot com
24	I picked up this book on the history of LucasArts . Gr8 book , really enjoying learning more about some classic games .  
24	 @ popey Not jumping to a conclusion ,  I did say it could be an error .  Freenode is up ,  I used Google DNS instead of Virgin provided to check  :  ) 
24	 @ virginmedia So is your traffic management via deep packet inspection or just on the amount of data being tx / rx by an IP ? 
24	 @ jon _ atkinson are you OK ?  Blink once for yes or twice to tell me to fuck off  ;  ) 
24	 @ ben _ nuttall  @ phpcodemonkey  @ jontheniceguy  @ robiebasak  @ samheadleand  @ elsie _ m _  Thanks Ben ,  nice write up .  You did a lot of good work in 2013
24	 @ ntoll  @ virginmedia I changed my DNS to Google and I can reach Freenode ok .  Virgin has had routing issues in past few weeks . 
24	Hi  @ virginmedia Im trying to upload 10gb of video to YouTube but my connection keeps timing out .  Are there upload restrictions ?  Thx
24	 @ fortyfourMu ha thanks for the heads up
24	 @ JF _ archer  @ MethodDan Congrats Jon ,  if you need anything just drop me a line  :  ) 
24	 @ corenominal  @ JF _ archer Remember for LED resistance is not futile ,  it stops the bulbs blowing up with too much voltage  ;  )   # sysadminBADJOKE

24	Its going to take the best part of 24hrs to upload my  @ McrRaspJam videos to Youtube .  .  . OMG !  !  !   @ ben _ nuttall
24	 @ Sam _ 152  @ p0welly try using Google DNS  ( 8 . 8 . 8 . 8  & amp ;  8 . 8 . 4 . 4 )  .  I dont think it has been blocked ,  merely  @ virginmedia DNS is having issues . 
24	 @ isDavidNelson  @ TommyBobbins PiFace C & amp ; D is a great board and well suited to this task . I made a streamer radio in July , v messy without PiFace
24	 @ ben _ nuttall  @ cymplecy yeah he is ,  lovely guy . 
24	 @ MethodDan  " I hope Satan brings you something made of rice ?  " 
24	Today  @ towerlug our youngest hacker ,  Kieran , 12 , made his first  @ ShrimpingIt kit and then learnt to hack USB xmas lights into a simple project
24	 @  _  _ Freakyclown _  _  Cool  :  ) 
24	
24	 @ corenominal Im a tplink fan as they can beflashed with openwrt ,  any model with gigabit LAN is good  @ methodman knows buffalo really well .

24	 @ ollyclarkdotorg  @ cpc _ tweet  @ ShrimpingIt  @ towerlug God bless Poundland and their limitless supply of USB powered crap  ;  ) 
24	 @ ben _ nuttall  @ cymplecy I got a Gertduino for Xmas ,  not had chance to use it yet .  Initial reviews have said that it is a pain to setup
24	 @ iMartyn  @ JF _ archer Theyre pi powered Quadro - Swans  ;  )

24	 @ heeedt yeah Ive been sat in house ,  sent my phone out in a  @ Raspberry _ Pi powered big trak with web cam for pic  " proof "   ;  ) 
24	
24	 @ cjdell  @ northernrailorg  @ northernfail Where you at mate ? 
24	 @ SByrneFraser  @ kingcone99 Gents ,  if you have a DS or PSP ,  you can get a SNES emu to run on it .   =  Pocket SNES !
