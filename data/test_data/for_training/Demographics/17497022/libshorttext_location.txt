7	 @ ssfarrar  @ lkahney Didnt say it was awful .  Its amateur ,  rife w /  usability issues ,  no better than on par w /  Google  & amp ;  MS — a lost advantage . 
7	 @ cultofmac  @ ssfarrar Id have been so into this book before iOS 7 ;   great industrial designer ,  now poster child for the Peters principle . 
7	 @ jeff _ foust  @ NASAWatch so the next question :  what has to change ?   .  .  . and how do you suggest making the changes ? 
7	 @ GuyKawasaki writing to ones future self seems hubris but Duolingo ?  I love this app—is learning another language really procrastination ? 
7	 @ techsavvyed Im no MS fan ,  often behind the death of great software ,  perhaps here too .   Office upgrades may suck but dont loose features . 
7	 @ tedtodorov  @ happywaffle  @ daringfireball Quickoffice 
7	 @ waltmossberg theres got to be more to it — You add a name to differentiate :  iPad ,  iPad mini ,  older iPads .  Methinks :  Air ,  Mini ,   ( new item ) 
7	I predict  ( for the same reasons )  that the new  # iWork will have the same impact to the productivity App ecosystem as Bento had to databases . 
7	 @ tedtodorov  @ happywaffle  @ daringfireball its now just a toy ,  a gimick . 
7	 @ tedtodorov  @ happywaffle  @ daringfireball it mostly sucks on iPad .   Good demoware but not useful ,  on par with Google docs .  MS Office wins . 
7	 @ daringfireball the analogy doesnt capture magnitude :  there are small business  ( like mine )  for which iWork was the core of their workflow . 
7	 @ Kaostricks iWork is no longer a serious product .  Now competes with Google docs .  MS has that and a real product :  Office .    Apple conceded . 
7	 @ techsavvyed its not an upgrade — its a downgrade ,  of course its free .   Those that invested in iWork as a workflow app  ( me )  were screwed . 
7	 @ tim _ cook if Eddy Cue isn’t fired over iWork ,   ( Numbers in particular )  you don’t give a damn about your customers . 
7	 @ waltmossberg article idea :  harm done to small businesses who embraced iWork only to have the product lobotomized by an iPad obsessed Apple . 
7	 @ konstantinbe didnt mean to jump on you .  Numbers has been the core of my companys workflow .  This revision is a disaster for us . 
7	 @ cue Numbers has been the core of my companys work flow .  Now its worthless .  Cant update to Mavericks ,  will loose time  & amp ;   $  switching to  ?  ? 
7	 @ konstantinbe are you kidding me ?  ?  They trashed everything good about Numbers and made the Mac version as brain dead as the iPad version . 
7	 @ gruber the problem is iWork is now worthless crap
7	I’m having an anxiety attack !   iWork Numbers is the backbone of my company and Apple destroyed it !  !  !

7	 @ CaliLewis  @ gruber  @ iphone _ dev every day I find new HI ugliness /  deficiencies in iOS 7  ( tonight :  find in Safari )  — RU experiencing the same ? 
7	 @ tim _ cook very happy with most 9 / 10 announcements ,  core tech ,  iOS 7  -  good ,  HI  -  very amateur — huge advantage squandered .  Needs a revisit . 
7	 @ LISACTV  @ saatchi _ gallery I thought it had more to do with respect than pedantics . 
7	 @ LISACTV  @ saatchi _ gallery 
7	 # iOS7  @ jonathan Ives  -  form follows function not the other way around .  iOS 7 folders  -  limit them to 9 items or choose a better metaphor . 
7	 # iOS7 being something if a  @ Jonathan Ives fan I was totally unprepared for how much I loath the look of iOS 7 .  Garish ,  and unbalanced . 
7	 @ saatchi _ gallery  @ LISACTV Pittsburgh not Pittsburg — classically as superficial as those who admire Andy Vorhola .  At least there is symmetry
7	 @ RickSantorum interesting ,  where can I get more information ? 
7	 @ dra4  @ rupertmurdoch maybe not in Australia but certainly in UK  & amp ;  USA  -  -  Id rather have private sector snooping . 
7	 @ rupertmurdoch but without govt .  workers the roads would disappear .  Most roads in W . PA were once dear trails — do deer have govt .  workers ? 
7	 @ Mahoney I .  Not happy about it .  Very much like iOS version still lobotomizes OS X files .   No evidence of print formatting for numbers . 
7	 @ iPadGuru  @ jonfingas   Amazon  & amp ;  the publishers pushing agent model were behaving monopolistically .   Apple wasnt yet theyre the ones sued .

7	If you ,  like me ,  were holding great hope in an  # iwork revival ,  despair . I just started the  # iCloud beta its the same rathole as in  # iOS .

7	 @ Ihnatko I see nothing good in iCloud .   It diminishes my ability to associate files  ( a troubling trend since X )  and it invades my privacy . 
7	 @ kathyschrock and this is better than Dropbox how ? 
7	 @ stuartgibson had the same problem :   iWork came installed on an older MacBook pro ,  app store wouldnt see it .  Ending :  repurchased  :  (

7	 @ sirgke if by  " interesting "  you mean  " depressing "  ,  I agree  -  -  iwork needs a major update .
