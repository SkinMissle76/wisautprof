-0.64	 @ alendrel Oh ,  you love it ,  you little minx . 
-0.64	 @ TransInAction To be honest ,  I dont either .  But I think ,  if people are choosing enemies ,  hes way the wrong target . 
-0.64	 @ gammaTHETA Why does it hurt ?  Hes a person you dont know .  What he thinks should be of no consequence to your daily life .  DisproveByExample

-0.64	 @ gammaTHETA Its a generalized statement ,  sure .  Do you think it made anyone hate bi people ?  If not ,  refocus on those that do . 
-0.64	 @ gammaTHETA Simple question .  If its gen .  statements you hate ,  theres worse protagonists .  If its against gay folks only ,  the bigot is you . 
-0.64	 @ TransInAction Then youre more Canadian than me .  I just think Dan Savage isnt an enemy to anyone with a soul .  Beginning and end .

-0.64	 @ alendrel  @ beyoungshutup When necessary ,  yes .  Every movement needs a kick in the ass at times .  See Occupy Wall Street . 
-0.64	 @ gammaTHETA You have just encapsulated my entire argument .  Nice work . 
-0.64	 @ gammaTHETA Oh good .  Im the problem .  Not the politicians trying to make it harder to get rights .  Not the media ignoring your issue .  I am . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup I know ,  much easier to pick on someone bigger than you and get page views from his reaction .  But lets fight real enemies eh ? 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup anyhow ,  lunch break over .  Its been nice .  Maybe go get someone elected .  Or unelected .  Or out of jail .  Make change ,  not lolcats
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup hes using words you dont like in promoting your cause .  First world problems in the extreme . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup you must be busy then because theres a lot ahead of him that need telling . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup no ,  I didnt say be an activist .  I said make change .  The world is full of activists .  Not much change . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup He didnt call you a bigot . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup rank him .  Where is he on that shitty people list ?  If hes in the top thousand ,  youre dreaming . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup by all means ,  hold him accountable .  But inflamed language and rhetoric isnt that .  Its picking a fight .  Make actual change . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup see ,  now youre misquoting .  Which ,  again ,  you dont need to do .  Find the true enemy .  You dont need to manufacture them . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup also ,  he is the best youve got .  Him ,  Eddie Izzard and Drew Carey reruns .  Sad but completely true .  They ran the ball forward . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup no Im saying of all the crimes committed against trans people ,  his dont make the top thousand . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup youre like a democrat refusing to vote for Obama because his health care law isnt good enough .  Circular firing squad . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup or ,  do more for trans folks than Savage has ,  instead of throwing bombs from the sidelines . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup the moment you cant take a wisecrack under any circumstances ,  youve lost .  Focus on the real hatemongers not language . 
-0.64	 @ sophiaphotos Im ignorant ?  Why ,  because I dont think someone who has pushed your barrow for 15 yrs should be shit on for selective quotes ? 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup if the worst enemy trans people have is Dan Savage ,  it must be paradise . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup youre inventing an enemy .  Name one person who has done more to bring the issue to the mainstream . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup  @ sophiaphotos he didnt dismissed the community .  He dismissed your silly complaints . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup  @ sophiaphotos in the rush to make a new enemy youre ignoring the real enemies actively pushing hate .  He aint that . 
-0.64	 @ beyoungshutup  @ sophiaphotos it doesnt matter .  Nobody has done more to put trans issues in the mainstream than Savage .  Circular firing squad
-0.64	 @ gammaTHETA  @ sophiaphotos sure I read it .  And each comment is abrupt ,  but a single line taken from 15 yrs of active promotion of such issues
-0.64	 @ sophiaphotos Request denied .  When the imperfect friend is your chosen enemy ,  the real enemy runs amok .
