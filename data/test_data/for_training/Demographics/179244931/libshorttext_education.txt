3	 @ stuzib85 Definitely .  Maldonados far too erratic to ever become a top driver .  Hes got a bad attitude too .  Im not a fan of his at all . 
3	 @ stuzib85 Such a shame .  Hes so so quick .  As a Sauber fan weve been lucky to grab him .  Would be nice if we could afford to keep him next yr
3	 @ OfficialSF1Team Good luck .  Lets do this !   # WeNeverGiveUp  # F1

3	 @ alphaadmgroup As always !  Alls good thanks  :  )  Hows things with you ?  Send my best to the A team
3	The only positive I can draw from Pastor Maldonado being announced at Lotus next year is that thankfully he wont be driving for Sauber !   # F1

3	The 90 miles from Pwllheli to Shrewsbury via the mountains in a blizzard storm was the most fun / exciting / scary drive Ive ever had in the UK
