33	 @ stuzib85 Magnussen looks very good .  I think Perez needed a bit more time to show his hand ,  bit like how GRO matured with Lotus this year
33	Josh Widdicombe takes to the stage to open the  # B2BAwards .   @ TMPtweets

33	 @ stuzib85 Yeah ,  a real shame for Perez .  Hes shown such flashes of brilliance over the past two years .  I think hed have shone in a good car
33	Shame to see Nico Hulkenberg leaving Sauber .  Hes made the wrong decision to sidestep back to Force India in my opinion .  .  .   # F1  # Hulk
33	 @ OfficialSF1Team I want to buy loads ,  but as much of a mega Sauber fan I am ,  I cant afford delivery to UK .  Do you have free delivery codes ?

33	 @ stuzib85 Definitely .  Maldonados far too erratic to ever become a top driver .  Hes got a bad attitude too .  Im not a fan of his at all . 
33	 @ stuzib85 Such a shame .  Hes so so quick .  As a Sauber fan weve been lucky to grab him .  Would be nice if we could afford to keep him next yr
33	 @ OfficialSF1Team Good luck .  Lets do this !   # WeNeverGiveUp  # F1

33	 @ powelly8 I thought it was a good show for him ,  even if the regeneration was pretty quick .  Just seen your TARDIS onesie .  Absolutely amazing ! 
33	The sooner Pastor Maldonado is out of F1 the better .  He may have money but his poor talent and bad attitude dont make him worthy of a drive
33	 @ alphaadmgroup As always !  Alls good thanks  :  )  Hows things with you ?  Send my best to the A team
33	The only positive I can draw from Pastor Maldonado being announced at Lotus next year is that thankfully he wont be driving for Sauber !   # F1
33	It seems the time I spent in Australia was during its hottest year on record !  I miss the heat so much !

33	To improve today even more ,  some jerk in an Audi just opened his door against the side of my car .  No physical damage but it infuriated me ! 
33	The 90 miles from Pwllheli to Shrewsbury via the mountains in a blizzard storm was the most fun / exciting / scary drive Ive ever had in the UK
