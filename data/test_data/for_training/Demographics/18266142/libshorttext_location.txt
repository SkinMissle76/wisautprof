45	Kids today get a lot of stick for talking in cinemas but in my experience its the older generations who are much worse .  STFU ! 
45	Film Diary :  All Is Lost ,  2013  -  ★★★★ :  A remarkable piece of film making ,  even more so when you consider its only .  .  .  
45	Film Diary :  The Hidden Fortress ,  1958  -  ★★★★ :  Considering how much I hated Desolation of Smaug yesterday it was .  .  .  
45	Oh maybe there isn’t a Twitter backlash .  I liked  # DoctorWho it was flawed and rushed but ultimately everything it should have been . 
45	Film Diary :  Scrooged ,  1988  -  ★★★½ :  Smart and enjoyable but not as great as I remembered from even a few years back .  
45	 @ missradders Thanks for mentioning this I’d forgotten  # TheBridge started tonight . 
45	Rebecca ,  Zulu and Doctor Zhivagao all on TV at the same time this afternoon . 
45	Superb evening catching up with Soderbergh’s “final” films and two more additions to my Film 2013 list . 
45	 @ paulgrav Nice to see you embracing the PS3 ,  I think it’s most likely to be my next console .  So many great games I’ve missed on the platform
45	 @ missradders I’ve always hated NYE as well .  Will probably end up going out but wish I could just skip it . 
45	 @ paulgrav I’ve got a backlog of games at the moment but more likely to buy a PS3 than PS4 or Xbox One
45	Also nice of Amazon to get into the true spirit of Christmas with lightning deals all day tomorrow . 
45	Film Diary :  The King of Pigs ,  2011  -  ★★★★ :  The fact that I stuck with this film through several technical issues .  .  .

45	 @ KermodeMovie These videos need to be compressed .  It’s nearly 900Mb for a 5 minute clip . 
45	More DVDs should come with Grandma commentaries . 
45	So that’s 365 feature films logged this year .  Think Nebraska was the only film I saw twice so should try and watch 1 more to end the madness
45	User reviews are so helpful… 
45	Film Diary :  Christmas in a Day ,  2013  -  ★★★ :  Disappointing after the excellent  " Life "  and  " Britain "  ,  this seems .  .  .

45	 @ missradders I  * knew *  it started but somehow didn’t see it when I was setting everything earlier . 
45	And by British TV I don’t mean Sky
45	Been struggling with an unresponsive home button ,  thought it was just my sluggish iPod Touch but this fixed it 
45	Didn’t realise there was now a podcast for  @ KermodeMovie Uncut  -  might be able to keep on top of it now . 
45	As much as I loved  # Sherlock it felt like it was a series of great moments hanging off a really weak story . 
45	Featuring the voice of Shut Up Buttwad  ( almost )  .  .  .   @ wittertainment 
45	Still looking for a decent ios app which allows  @ trakt checkins ,  preferably free . 
45	Wow It’s A Wonderful Life is actually on TV tomorrow afternoon ,  I don’t remember this ever happening before  # NotSarcasm
45	Anyone selling TV series online should always make the 1st episode available for free  ( and not charge the same price for 1hr as 1 / 2hr ) 
45	Film Diary :  The Whale ,  2013  -  ★★ :  Quite dark and brutal in places which makes it an even odder choice for prime .  .  .  
45	What on earth possessed Google to remove proper offline maps for Android ?  Are they trying to destroy every good thing they have ?

45	More emotions packed into 90 minutes of  @ telltalegames Walking Dead S2 Ep1 than anything else I’ve seen this year  # IamClementine
45	I’m certain there is absolutely no need for iTunes 12 Days Of Christmas app to require ios7
45	 @ NewOnNetflixUK Still found them quite useful ,  surprised there’s going to be anything left after the 5th
45	The Frankenstein trailer was so bad I thought a buddy monster was going to be introduced and the film would be called Frank n Stein

45	Film Diary :  The Hobbit :  The Desolation of Smaug ,  2013  -  ★★ :  This is the boring ,  overlong ,  CGI heavy mess I was .  .  .  
45	Hobbit 2 getting 5 stars in  @ empiremagazine might be the justification I’ve been looking for to cancel my subscription . 
45	Such a massive faff getting a  @ blinkbox film to play on Xbox and then the sound is out of sync so had to resort to PC anyway . 
45	Film Diary :  Anchorman :  The Legend of Ron Burgundy ,  2004  -  ★★★★ :  Im not someone who has watched Anchorman several .  .  .  
45	Just found out the excellent We Are The Best is based on a graphic novel ,  might need to check that out . 
45	 @ missradders Yeah real life scars from an accident I believe . 
45	Crikey ,  Ive just realised that Planes is probably worse than Cars 2
45	Film Diary :  Fantasia ,  1940 :  Watched on Friday December 27 ,  2013 .  
45	Still think it’s a shame Smith’s exit was shoehorned into a Christmas Day episode but not as bad as Twitter backlash would suggest
45	As much fun as the first two have been I hope  # Sherlock actually gets a proper case to solve in the final episode . 
45	Instagram :  Taking down the lights  @ SatScenes 
45	 @ ArtemisFoul1812  " Never Goodnight "  by the directors wife Coco Moodysson .  Cant find it though so perhaps only in Swedish . 
45	Not sure if the  @ letterboxd “This Year” count includes multiple viewings of the same film or just distinct films . 
45	Film Diary :  Cars 2 ,  2011  -  ★½ :  I suspect there are only two reasons this film exists ;  Firstly nobody stood up to .  .  .  
45	 @ missradders or very sad  :  -  )  I think reading 50 books is also impressive . 
45	 @ joshuasmay Side Effects and Behind The Candelabra .  Eventually got them to sync by fast forwarding and rewinding to start . 
45	Just tried watching George Washington on  @ netflixuk before it’s removed on Sunday ;  sound out of sync so had to give up  :  -  ( 
45	 @ kezamacdonald And this is the biggest problem in gaming .  I thought Tomb Raider was great but Lara must have slaughtered 100s
45	Whoever is running the  @ AmazonUK account for the last month or so is doing a great job .  Still rare for corporate accounts to get it right . 
45	Film Diary :  The Mummy ,  1959  -  ★★★ :  Fairly enjoyable but Id have preferred it without the lengthy Egyptian .  .  .  
45	Film Diary :  I Am Breathing ,  2013  -  ★★★½ :  A moving ,  honest and well made documentary that celebrates life as much .  .  .  
45	Is there no way of seeing the download size of videos in  @ GooglePlay and if not why not ? 
45	 @ kierenevans No ,  I was counting that as last year .  Downloading the new one to hopefully play tonight .

45	Those Daily Mail Sherlock captions can’t be real can they ? 
45	Still trying to get to 365 feature films before the end of the year .  Time to hit the 90 minute ones…
45	 @ blinkbox Wired Xbox .  Wifi laptop mostly ok but sound occasionally out of sync .  Tried Xbox later ,  resolved by ff to middle and rewinding
45	There isn’t a storm outside ,  this will make me feel guilty about staying indoors .  I may as well just start running again next year . 
45	Another film ruined by  @ HumaxUK box dodgy playback ;  really don’t think I can trust them anymore for upgrade or replacement
45	 @ AndrewCollins Money .  Surely the only motivation for any of Downton after the first series .

45	Film Diary :  Barneys Version ,  2010  -  ★★★ :  I think I shouldve liked this more than I did .  There isnt really .  .  .  
45	If you can’t stay up to watch Troll Hunter you really should watch the trailer ,  it may be better than the full film .

45	The looming doom of New Year’s Eve is already depressing me . 
45	Which reminds me…
45	Might have to go back home early to unlimited broadband to watch all the things on  @ NetflixUK before they expire on Sunday . 
45	Thought it was great that  @ KermodeMovie Uncut was available as a video podcast but not downloading 1 . 5Gb for 10 mins each week .  Compress . 
45	 @ blinkbox It happened on two films last night  ( Side Effects  & amp ;  Behind Candelabra )  fast forward to middle and rewound to get back in sync
45	I saw the Samaritans number 08457 90 90 90 everywhere over Christmas but no mention today  -  the most depressing day of the year
45	I always thought it was the price that put me off Apple hardware but it’s the constant cycle that means everything is obsolete so soon . 
45	Film Diary :  Wall Street :  Money Never Sleeps ,  2010  -  ★★½ :  Starts of slightly more engaging than the dated original .  .  .  
45	According to TV Guide it’s the TV premiere of Fantasia at 4 : 15pm BBC2
45	Otway the Movie is No . 2 in Guardian readers choice for films of 2013 .  Organised vote or genuine greatness ?  
45	If for some reason you didnt watch The Bridge its been shown again over Christmas before S2 starts in the new year . 
45	 @ gazpachodragon I think you can still get them through iTunes directly ,  you could last year . 
45	It’s A Wonderful Life is on C4 at 13 : 10 .  I don’t remember it ever been shown on British TV at Christmas ,  anybody know when it was last on ? 
45	For anyone who has played Bioshock Infinite this is brilliant :

45	Film Diary :  The Fox and the Hound ,  1981 :  Watched on Friday December 27 ,  2013 .  
45	Looks like lots of the stand up shows I wanted to watch on  @ NetflixUK are expiring next Sunday  :  -  (

45	Film Diary :  Good Hair ,  2009  -  ★★★★ :  Wow ,  this is great .  Theres nothing that special about the documentary but .  .  .  
45	First question in  @ radiotimes quiz  " Who killed Danny Latimer "  yet another example of a completely unnecessary spoiler .

45	Argh .  Miscounted .  So much for not watching films today . 
45	 @ boydhilton Oh good it’s getting overlooked by everyone but I was relying on you to praise it . 
45	Can’t believe how quickly this year has gone .  The horse meat thing happened in January . 
45	 @ tom _ chapman Yeah that’s what I thought when it didn’t turn up in the search . 
45	 @ missradders OITNB is my next Netflix series ,  highest rated after Breaking Bad in end of year things . 
45	Blue Valentine is a better film than Blue Is The Warmest Colour and covers the ups and downs of love in a much better way . 
45	Film Diary :  The Spiral Staircase ,  1945  -  ★★★★ :  Beautiful cinematography ,  atmospheric ,  chilling ,  tense and less .  .  .  
45	Packing to go home for Christmas ,  hoping its safe to assume I only need enough socks to last until Wednesday .

45	Its not just  @ GooglePlay who make it difficult to see if a film is available to rent and / or buy  -   @ blinkbox are just as bad
45	TVs need to be dumb panels not “smart” .  Phones smaller not bigger .  Apple stuff cheaper not thinner / lighter / coloured

45	Ive just realised that Pikmin 3 is the only game Ive played in the last year or so that hasnt been massively flawed in some way .
