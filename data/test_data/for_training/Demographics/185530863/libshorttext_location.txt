39	Im sitting in a rather random and awkward group of outstanding dancers waiting for rehearsal
39	Flying in a shoebox with wings .  .  .

39	Made an 1 . 33 hour Dubstep remix when I should have been packing .  Guess its time to get back to stuffing my suitcases # procrastination
39	Cracked the top of my iPhone at valleyfair
39	I hate my bank .  .  .  They merged into another and now my automatic transfer from my savings to checking is all screwed up .

39	Has received many a glance tonight lol ,  havent even been here an hour yet . 
39	Work up late for the master class this morning  :  (  as in it started 45 min ago and Im just now up . 
39	Home from my 12 . 5 hour driving trip to Grand Forks ,  ND and back . Too long to be in the car ,  without a break ,  by far . 
39	Well at least hes a nice older guy with a very northern European accent
39	About to pick up some random old guy in Hastings ,  drive him 6 hours to Grand Forks ND .  Then turn around and drive 5 hours home
39	Really wishing that I didnt find being up at 2 and later to be so nice .  I feel its a time that I can really get things done and catch up
39	Learned of a Econ test I didnt realize I had when I walked into class .  .  .  Guess I will retake it at a later point  :  -  / 
39	Cold morning ,  woke up late .  Should be a great way to start Nuvo this morning . 
39	Hmm a head - on collision .  Definitely not how I expected to start off the day  :  ( 
39	This place is kinda sketchy lol  @ CaliforniaGhost  .  .  .  oh well lets see how it goes haha
39	Its really nice when people respond to emails promptly  ( not sarcastic )  .  Hopefully the chat in person will go over even better  :  ) 
39	Has been having a huge writers block .  .  .  2 . 5 hours of work has culminated into a whole 3 sentences  :  -  ( 
39	 @ CaliforniaGhost great .  .  .  Haha
39	 @ CaliforniaGhost lol I will try here in a sec .  Watching a couple dance videos first  :  ) 
39	Is procrastinating ,  the 3 - 5 page History paper is not enticing at the moment .  .  .  But I have exhausted both Facebook and Twitter now .  .  .   :  (

39	At the convention center really late compared to when I wanted to be here .  Still gotta register  :  -  / 
39	I hate it when I forget to take my stay awake meds .  To tired  :  ( 
39	Kill me now ,  my online College Algebra is Annoying .  Why did I do this to myself ?  ! 
39	Two nights in a row I drive all the way to dance only to find it canceled  :  ( 
39	No Insanity this morning ,  going to treat today as the day of rest  ( Sunday )  and just add an extra day onto next week starting tomorrow  :  ) 
39	Im bored and unable to fall asleep .  Gah why must I be awake with no one to talk to
39	And by day 4 I mean day 3 .   ( stupid autocorrect lol ) 
39	Day 4 of the Insanity workout ,  did it alone  :  (  still was an amazingly hard and fun workout . 
39	 .  .  . because I havent been in working on it with anyone besides  @ Timmysimmy since October  :  ( 
39	Just learned that WCDE decided to open up their competition to solos and I cant do it .  .  . 
39	Just finished reading Fight Club .  Definitely on my list of favorite books .  It was just plain brilliant . 
39	Oh well enough half asleep poems with incomplete thoughts .  One more dreamer off to bed .  The start of day 2 of Insanity in 8 . 5 hours ! 
39	Ive yet to have any moments where we can truly be our selves .  Signs pointing in every opposite direction .  Ones bound to get lost in this . 
39	I know its anticipation so why not just tell me ?  Or are you just as shy as me .  .  . 
39	Just cant seem to get over the sudden exhalation of air you give every time we almost touch .  That high squeak that you dont know or realize
39	 @ Timmysimmy thats good ,  I really want to see the show once its all ready .  But alas you guys arent coming to Minneapolis lol
39	 @ heiden85 just using rice protein powder because I have many food allergies and its the only one I found Im not allergic to
39	 @ Timmysimmy so true ,  hows being back out at bad boys ? 
39	 @ heiden85 it was ridiculously challenging ,  but I am looking forward to it . 
39	First day of the Insanity Workout .  I am dead ,  hope thats a good sign lol
39	Starting the Insanity workout tomorrow morning with  @ Californiaghost should be fun .  Wonder where its going to take me in 60 days .

39	Ah great night ,  time to head home ,  catch some quick sleep .  Maybe study a bit more then leave home in 4 . 5 hours for my final .  Lets do it !   :  ) 
39	Never good when studying over a break turns into a shopping trip to target  :  -  / 
39	Happy 21st birthday  @ CaliforniaGhost  !  !  !  !   :  ) 
39	Wishes everyone could just tell what other people felt .  It would make things so much easier when you see a missed opportunity slip away
39	Sitting watching a party is not as fun as joining in .  Allergies suck lol
39	Had a dream that I really wish was real .  It kinda sucked being brought back down to earth as I woke up . Oh if only I werent so shy .
