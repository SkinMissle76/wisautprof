-1	 @ virginmedia Got there in the end . 
-1	 @ LozEWright  @ virginmedia Certainly worth a conversation -  if you can get through .  15 minutes on hold so far is not helping my mood currently . 
-1	Wow .  Gary Barlow is currently dueting with  .  .  .  himself on BBC1 .  That gives new meaning to egotistical .   # NewYearsEve
-1	Simple ,  powerful  @ MetroUK front page .  No words needed on a day like this .   # Madiba 
-1	One day ,  just one day ,  Im sure that  @ FGW will get me home on time .  Today is not going to be that day . 
-1	 @ ThisIs _ Progress Well done chaps . 
-1	Todays  @ FGw train home has been delayed due to  " poor rail conditions .  "  Now theres a vague statement if ever Ive heard one . 
-1	 @ MrsVsTreasures  @ AlfieSausageDog  :  ) 
-1	Looking forward to  @ RealDoctorStus big TV debut on BBC4 at 9pm .  Hell be doing what he does best :  dunking biscuits with  @ NigelSlater . 
-1	Will be watching  # Sherlock tonight .  Dont really need to now mind ,  given all the spoilers that have been dominating my timeline all day . 
-1	It wouldnt be Christmas without  # BatteriesNotIncluded .  Love this film .  A true 80s classic . 
-1	 @ Chelle _ PR  @ ms _ organised Merry Christmas to you both  -  have a drink for me ! 
-1	I enjoyed  @ impactwrestlings  # FinalResolution show  ( due to air in the UK tomorrow eve )  .  Keep an eye out for my  @ DailyMirror recap on Monday . 
-1	 @ LizDumain At least hes honest . 
-1	 @ tweetpaulobrien Have I made my long - anticipated star cameo yet ?   # fluffer
-1	 # AskBG  -  why social media integration will be key for 2014 :  
-1	Highlight of Decs  @ prweekuknews :  Dogs Trust CEO Clarissa Baldwin discussing origins of A dog is for life campaign 35 yrs ago .   # charity
-1	Watching  # GreatBritishBiscuit ?   @ GuruMags  @ RealDoctorStu will be doing science bit later .  Read his dunking thoughts :  
-1	 @ youngblooms  @ LizDumain  @ MrsVsTreasures Nice . 
-1	Ill never forget visiting Mandelas tiny cell on Robben Island .  Its almost beyond belief that he overcame that to accomplish so much after . 
-1	 @ FGW The 18 : 07 to Trowbridge .  Its been delayed every single day this week . 
-1	The rains continuing to pummel the office windows this morning .  I may need an ark to get home tonight . 
-1	Satisfying to see the little wooden chalets being packed away in  # Bath this morning .  May actually be able to move in the city again now . 
-1	Such a revelation to finally have a phone capable of tweeting in the centre of Bath .  Its been two VERY long and unhappy years with  @ o2 . 
-1	Get yourself ready for  # FinalResolution tomorrow by reading my exclusive  @ DailyMirror interview with  @ MagnusOfficial :  
-1	2013 has been an amazing life - changing year .  Now to mark its end in fine style with  @ MrsVsTreasures  @ LizDumain  @ MorseBrown  & amp ;   @ RealDoctorStu ! 
-1	Three working weeks left until the Christmas holidays .  Lots to do before then mind ! 
-1	FInally getting the opportunity to start watching The Bible adaptation that aired on  @ channel5 _ tv recently .  Very well done so far . 
-1	Off to the cinema now with  @ MrsVsTreasures to see a film Im rather excited about .  Its kind of a big deal .   # NewsteamAssemble
-1	 @ LozEWright An evening off .  Returning home now .  .  . 
-1	 @ FGW Ill believe that when I see it Ollie .  Im fully expecting yet another price hike after Christmas instead of a reduction . 
-1	 @ ewardhunt It really was  -  I hit snooze twice ! 
-1	Judging by the  # journo requests coming through today ,  it looks like January will be dominated by  # fitness stories .  Theres a shocker . 
-1	 @ SeanMichaelH Thanks for that .  Have you got a signed photo content form for the chap on the right ? 
-1	Looking forward ,  cant wait to officially welcome our beautiful son into the world at  @ WWiltsVineyard Church on Sun .  A very special weekend . 
-1	 @ tweetpaulobrien Oooh .  .  . 
-1	 @ ghalfacree Its all about attention to detail !  Hope youre well Gareth . 
-1	Another year and another disgustingly high price hike from  @ virginmedia .  On the plus side ,  we now get the channel Gold  + 1 .  Wow .   # sarcasm
-1	 @ FGW Cant you use one from a different route during this very busy period ?  The Paddington train always has 8 carriages ,  for example . 
-1	So  @ MrsVsTreasures has just revealed that shes never seen Planes Trains  & amp ;  Automobiles .  This oversight will be rectified tonight . 
-1	 @ FGW I have a monthly season ticket . 
-1	 @ dannywallace It really is ! 
-1	 @ ewardhunt Best of luck for your first day back .  Ive already drunk a lot of coffee ! 
-1	This belated present from my pop has just been unwrapped .  Merry Christmas to me .  .  .  
-1	Very pleased with this awesome  @ Media _ Safari Secret Santa gift from  @ marcg392 .  He knows my tastes well .  
-1	Postman Pat now flies a helicopter ?  Well I never .  No wonder the cost of stamps keeps rising . 
-1	Should we trust  # Google or the Government to keep us safe ?   ( via  @ mattwarman )  :  
-1	Very sad news dominating Twitter tonight  -  the passing of a truly great man in Nelson Mandela .  One of the most inspiring figures in history . 
-1	 @ tweetpaulobrien Yes .  Yes it is . 
-1	 @ Marketing _ Chap  @ Daily _ Express Princess Diana AND a story about a cold winter on the front page ?  Thats bound to shift some units . 
-1	I wonder if Jools Holland is currently watching  # GaryBarlow and seething :   " why didnt I play with myself ?  "   # NewYearsEve
-1	Im full of ale and kebab .  Its a glorious feeling . 
-1	 @ andrewsonline Many congratulations Michael on todays  @ EAELIVE award .  A great achievement ! 
-1	There are far too many Christmas trees in my timeline today . 
-1	 @ SeanMichaelH Oh do stop  " droning "  on about it .  .  . 
-1	Yes ,  I will be watching the return of  # BOAF in five minutes .  I know its wrong ,  but it just feels so right . 
-1	Happy birthday to  @ JoshWinning !  Have a terrific day my good man  :  ) 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _  Oh good .  Answering all of those childrens parents wouldnt have been a fun task ! 
-1	Weve finally caught up with  # Homeland .  That was one heck of a cliffhanger .  Crikey . 
-1	 @ jimsmallman A nod to Papa Shango would be a nice touch .   # voodoomaster
-1	A nice end to the week as the Christmas decorations have gone up today in the  @ Media _ Safari office .  Not long to go now ! 
-1	 @ JoshWinning Let me know if its good .  Ive heard excellent things . 
-1	 @ mikebeecham Happy new year Mike !  Did you happen to catch the TV adaptation of The Bible recently ?  Have only seen half so far but well done . 
-1	Having a debate with  @ LizDumain  & amp ;   @ morsebrown about whether crisps qualify as amuse - bouche .  I think they do .   # firstworldproblems
-1	 @ sparksy3  @ MrsVsTreasures Really lovely thanks  -  were all enjoying spending lots of time together .  Hows yours been ? 
-1	 @ AngelaCassidy83 Theyre amazing .  Love the penguins .  Im hungry now . 
-1	Chuckled at the  @ drewb quote in Decembers  @ prweekuknews .  Ive heard some memorable business phone calls on my commute over the years ! 
-1	 @ FGW Ah ,  the Government .  Sure theyll ensure that there are no new year price hikes for commuters .  *  * Sarcasm doesnt work well on Twitter . 
-1	 @ ewardhunt Agreed !  How was your first day back in the end ?  Mine was unsurprisingly very busy ,  playing catch - up . 
-1	 @ manaboutoffice Biscuits are always the best result  -  especially at this time of year !  Has the mo gone now ? 
-1	 @ LozEWright  @ virginmedia Yep  -  either Im offered a better deal as a long - standing customer ,  or we go elsewhere for these services . 
-1	 @ Sara _ Hadley Happy 2014 Sara !  Hope its a great one for you  :  ) 
-1	Passengers arent even able to leave the train at Freshford  & amp ;  Avoncliff today because its so crowded .  Unbelievable .   @ FGW
-1	In one week itll be Christmas Day .  How is that possible ?  ! 
-1	 @ SeanMichaelH An incredible gurner though .  Im in awe of him . 
-1	Just four working days left until 2013 draws to a close .  Need to put a serious dent in the to do list today .   # PR
-1	 @ lizintheshed I do try and avoid online chatter about these things ,  but it was unavoidable this time round ! 
-1	This  @ FGW train is now 19 mins late and will have two coaches  -  to accommodate the huge swell of passengers waiting for it .  Thisll be fun . 
-1	 @ SeanMichaelH He said many things .  But to be honest I could understand a word of it . 
-1	 @ MagnusOfficial Tomorrow ?  Worryingly I thought it was Thursday already .  Oh dear . 
-1	Crumbs .  The US announces six drone test sites :  
-1	Anyone out there know how to unsync two iPhones that are both using same iTunes account ?  Wife  & amp ;  I both receiving each others texts now . 
-1	 @ virginmedia Trying to phone you to carry out the  " health check "  that you suggested  -  and all of your lines are busy .  Thats most helpful . 
-1	 @ tweetpaulobrien To quote a fellow bearded man  -   " YES !  YES !  YES !  " 
-1	Tucking into a healthy lunch ,  for once .  It must be January .  
-1	 @ tweetpaulobrien Youre more than welcome .  Cant wait to read Volume 3 in 2014 ! 
-1	I was tasked with making baby Jesus biscuits at church this morning .  The end result was pretty darn special .  
-1	 @ coldplay Congratulations !  A great achievement . 
-1	Its 21 : 01 and  @ RealDoctorStu has been spotted for the first time !   # GreatBritishBiscuit
-1	 @ AngelaCassidy83 Have any festive cupcakes been baked yet ? 
-1	Whoops .  In a conversation about Coca - Cola with  @ SeanMichaelH ,  I think I may have just let the cat out of the bag about Santa Claus .  Sorry . 
-1	Relieved to have made it back home safely this evening .  The train was making some incredibly worrying clunking sounds at one point . 
-1	Does anyone else feel like Christmas has already been and gone this year ? 
-1	Storming my way through e2 by Matt Beaumont .  Every bit as funny as his first  # advertising novel  -  superb stuff .  
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _  Im considering cycling to work from next year rather than catching the train each day .  May have to get some tips from you . 
-1	 @ MrsVsTreasures Lovely stuff .  Look forward to seeing my awesome family shortly . 
-1	 @ ewardhunt Same as me  -  I usually work in the middle .  But its very nice to come back refreshed after a long break . 
-1	 @ MickieJames  @ MagnusOfficial Have a great time in Norwich !  Im heading back there in a few days ,  shame to have just missed you both . 
-1	A price hike of only £4 a month ?  I must admit Im rather surprised by that .  Good start to the day ! 
-1	Id almost forgotten what it feels like to be up and awake at this hour .  Now to find out how much my rail season tickets risen by .  .  . 
-1	 @ drewb  @ prweekuknews Of course  -  here you go .  .  .  
-1	Brilliant !   & gt ;  & gt ;  RT  @ WesternDaily :   @ coldplay stun locals with secret gig at  # Somerset pub  -  
-1	 @ NatWest _ Help When is online banking going to be available again please ? 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _  Ouch !  What did you say ? 
-1	 @ FGW In which case Heather ,  could you please answer why extra carriages are not being put on for the weekday commuter journeys .  .  . 
-1	My festive jumper is being proudly worn today .  Looking forward to the  @ Media _ Safari Christmas lunch !   # ChristmasJumperDay
-1	 @ mikebeecham Im half way through the second one .  Always hard to find the time for TV ! 
-1	Finally home .  Ill be looking into cycle routes to Bath in the new year .  I simply cant keep paying  @ FGW for such an awful daily service . 
-1	Its TNA  # FinalResolution tonight .  Best of luck to  @ MagnusOfficial as he competes for the big one .  Will he become the 1st Brit world champ ? 
-1	 @ carriesparkle Youre welcome Carrie  -  happy new year and all the best for 2014 ! 
-1	 @ HarringtonBear Thanks ,  you too .  Yes really looking forward to it ,  just hoping that Ive got rid of this stonking cold by then ! 
-1	 @ HarringtonBear I do also .  Its exceedingly annoying . 
-1	That being said ,  now that I can tweet on the move ,  Ive run out of things to say .  Returning to my book now .  .  . 
-1	 @ ms _ organised  @ HarringtonBear  @ pinkglitter1974  @ SimonBowyerKL  @ Ericseptimus  @ SpotlessSpaces  @ ToMSturf  @ BenValeHyp Thanks  -  you too ! 
-1	 @ ghalfacree Very well thanks ,  just gearing up for Christmas .  I swear it gets earlier every year .  .  . 
-1	 @ laurakotula Its going to be a busy week ! 
-1	 @ LizDumain  @ youngblooms  @ MrsVsTreasures Ill eat anything .  Surprise me . 
-1	 @ manaboutoffice Ill bet she is .  Mines now on its way to becoming a fully - fledged beard .  Far better ! 
-1	 # GreatBritishBiscuit could be used for one heck of a drinking game .  Just down a shot every time the word  " biscuit "  is uttered .  Hiccup . 
-1	 @ SiobhanPrideaux Thanks for the retweet Siobhan .  Many youll have better luck getting a decent response from them than I have ! 
-1	 @ FGW Yes ,  from Bath .  Its a shame that you dont have a compensation policy for recurrent delays  -  15 - 20 mins each day really adds up . 
-1	Miffed to have come down with yet another cold .  The festive season has not treated me too well so far . 
-1	 @ mattwarman Thanks for the retweet Matt .  A very interesting read . 
-1	Just noted  @ FGWs Twitter account is now manned from 07 : 00  -  22 : 00 daily .  Curious ,  then ,  that not 1 of my tweets have been addressed all wk . 
-1	It is officially Christmas .  And I am officially very excited . 
-1	Golly .  This chap really enjoys his biscuits .   # GreatBritishBiscuit
-1	 @ MrsVsTreasures Im on the train home and actually able to tweet !  What a revelation to have a decent phone network finally . 
-1	 @ manaboutoffice It is indeed .  Huge thanks for the sponsorship  -  incredibly generous of you .  United we Mo ! 
-1	Wonders will never cease :  Ive just found ,  and purchased ,  two rather nice sale items from  # Topman .  Think I was oldest customer in the store . 
-1	Ill bet James LeGros was so proud to be cast as Goon number 2  # BatteriesNotIncluded 
-1	 @ bull Its hard to know the right words to use on such a day .  But Mandela certainly achieved many huge victories during his life . 
-1	Delighted to say that  # Anchorman2 more than delivers on expectations .  The funniest film of 2013 by far .  WHAMMY ! 
-1	The  # firstworldproblems continue  -  my caviar is spreading unevenly .  What to do ?   # newyearseve 
-1	From  @ virginmedia :   " its never nice when your bill goes up .  "  Glad you agree .  So stop the annual increases then ,  and everyone will be happy . 
-1	Oh botherations .  My champagne hibiscus isnt opening up .   # firstworldproblems  # newyearseve 
-1	Another great journey home with  @ FGW .  22 mins late and dangerously overcrowded now .  Appalling service .  
-1	There is no sadness in a great man passing at 95 .  What is sad is that Mandelas vision of equality for all is still not a reality  # Madiba
-1	 @ jamesgreenphoto Good luck with that  -  sounds like great fun  ;  -  ) 
-1	Happy new year everyone !  Wishing you many blessings and every success in 2014 .   # HappyNewYear
-1	 @ virginmedia I particularly like how youve used 2013s template again for this price hike letter .  Keeping copyrighting costs down at least . 
-1	 @ FGW  .  .  . extra at weekends ,  but that doesnt help those of us that fork out for season tickets every single month . 
-1	 "  @ TNADixie saw something in me before anyone else "   -    @ MagnusOfficial on main event stardom :  
-1	 @ tweetpaulobrien It does nothing for me either  -  completely overhyped .  Happy new year Paul ! 
-1	 " This smells like my guinea pigs cage .  "  Good to know ,   @ NigelSlater ,  good to know .   # GreatBritishBiscuit
-1	They dont make films like this anymore .  The elderly lady in particular is an absolute treat .   # BatteriesNotIncluded
-1	 @ drewb  @ prweekuknews Youre welcome Drew . 
-1	 @ SeanMichaelH Talking of photo permissions ,  that profile pic looks awfully familiar .  .  . 
-1	Standing room only YET AGAIN on  @ FGW train home .  Extra carriages would be nice during the  # BathChristmasMarket please . 
-1	Working on a piece about widespread UK  # tablet adoption this morning .  Amazing how much more accessible the  # technology has become in 2013 . 
-1	 @ FGW  .  .  . during the Bath Christmas Market ?  Every night is horribly overcrowded and an absolute misery .  I note that youre putting on .  .  . 
-1	 @ LizDumain Ive just finally made it home on a delayed and ridiculously cramped train  ( i . e .  the usual )  .  Hope you get back soon . 
-1	Returning home now after a very busy first day back at  @ Media _ Safari HQ .  The team are starting 2014 as we mean to go on ! 
-1	So this is happening tonight .  .  .   # festivefavourite 
-1	 @ JoshWinning Youre welcome chief ,  sorry that we werent organised enough to post you a card .  Hows your day been so far ? 
-1	Enjoying a quiet eve listening to  @ matt _ redman .  Tickets booked for Bath ,  should be an great night of  # worship .
