16	 @ katykoos in fairness Hill ,  despite being someone who has  ( astonishingly )  found love and management ,  even I find it rage inducing

16	 @ Lornstar1980  @ katykoos I think you both know me well enough to know that thinness wouldnt sway me  -  brains and feistiness all the way
16	 @ katykoos  @ roxotron I agree .  But Im not allowed to say it any more ,  by order of The Management

16	 @ graceHQsky what has she done anyway  -  I wasnt paying much attention
16	 @ evilnoob did it come through DPD ? 
16	 @ Lottie _ AFC yup
16	It must be one of those laws .  Like when the Reliant Scimitar is mentioned ,  its the law to say  " Princess Anne owned a Reliant Scimitar " 
16	 @ LMac1970 knowing quite a number of marketeers ,  I think its more that they cant handle 4 - syllable words

16	Good news :  wireless ,  tea and a lovely bowl of porridge before work . Bad news :  work  # EndOfChrimbletide
16	 @ seanayling  @ quixoticgeek I suspect it was because the wireless was historically how comedy was consumed ,  so done old way for non - TV homes
16	If anyone wants a simple answer as to why  @ Lornstar1980 is the only lady Ive been engaged to  -  we twerk at  @ BBCRadio4 theme tunes
