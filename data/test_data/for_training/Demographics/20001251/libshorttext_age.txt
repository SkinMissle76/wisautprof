-0.3	 @ DyfrigWilliams think he and scarlets will benefit from him being a coach elsewhere first .  maybe in 2 years time after turning wasps around . 
-0.3	 @ DyfrigWilliams yes ,  think its the best way forward ,  hes not ready to retire but hoping scarlets will have him back as a coach in 6 yrs

-0.3	 @ ljhdScarlets I reckon he will be back as a coach after perfecting his skills elsewhere .
