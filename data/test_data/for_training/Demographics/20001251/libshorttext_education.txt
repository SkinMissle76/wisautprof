2	 @ SanjayWills I personally fancy Sunnyhillboy good odds at 20 : 1 ,  think he may have a chance of doing well . 
2	Not a bad night ,  thankyou  @ neilpd for not being too miserable !   # notquitetghetimeofhislife
2	and  @ neilpd are very excited to go see  # anightofdirtydancing tonight .  Well have the time of our life .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
2	 @ DyfrigWilliams think he and scarlets will benefit from him being a coach elsewhere first .  maybe in 2 years time after turning wasps around . 
2	 @ DyfrigWilliams yes ,  think its the best way forward ,  hes not ready to retire but hoping scarlets will have him back as a coach in 6 yrs
2	lost sympathy for those that say they work 48 wks of the year .   @ neilpd   &   @ DyfrigWilliams no work to do ?   # cloggingmytwitterfeed
2	aha  # missionpossible the word free became the keyword .  5 emails later I have company !  !  Thankyou Cambrian News . 
2	Just won tickets for  # anightofdirtydancing now how do i convince neil to take me .   # missionimpossible  ?  ? 
2	 @ ljhdScarlets Obviously not following enough of them !  !  Nice to know though x
2	 @ Matthew _ Rees _ 2 First player I have seen to wish Stevo well ,  was starting to think noone liked him !  ? 
2	 @ ljhdScarlets Think Jones could do well for the Wasps assuming they dont go into administration . 
2	 @ ljhdScarlets I reckon he will be back as a coach after perfecting his skills elsewhere . 
2	Great to see  # StephenJones trending ,  but wish he was on twitter and going somewhere a bit better . 
2	Almost want to lose my phone so I can sing  # wheremykeys  # bgt
2	 @ ShaneWilliams11 hope you are hitting aber town tonight !

2	 @ ljhdScarlets absolutely but he always said he was available til he wasnt wanted / needed .  nice one for scarlets names .  . bugging me . 
2	 @ ljhdScarlets  .  .  .  .  . unless serious injuries happen which wont do anyone any good . 
2	 @ ljhdScarlets you dont think he has chosen to play scarlets over baa - baas ?  who is 3rd no10 ?  sadly think hes played his last wales game .  .  . 
2	Fed up with all the press about Stephen Jones .  .  .  .  . hed never have planned his last game .  Out of pub eye during intl career and after .   # No10
2	Jamie Roberts and his crossroads 
2	 @ neilpd

2	My pet hate :  people smiling and laughing when giving bad news . 
2	He destroyed my chicken during the inspection process .  There is a reason why I dont bother cooking . 
2	Well the chicken looks ready .  What veg to peel next ?  Hoping Neil sees my plea for help . 
2	Should probably start the roast dinner , but wouldnt like to spoil it . Would be very sad end to a chickens life to have me attempt cooking it
2	Beef burger in the harbour master .  Wrong ?  No absolutely delicious . 
2	Having a bad day already .  Thank god it is Friday

2	has had a perfect weekend ,  what a shame its monday again tomorrow .  although xmas day no1 next weekend should be fun  : o ) 
2	can easily fill a suitcase with 15kg ,  but how do i fill a small rucksack with 10 kilos to make the most of the allowance .  .  .  .  . bricks ? 
2	is looking forward to school trip no .  1 tomorrow
2	cant believe that leaving aber is looking appealing right now .
