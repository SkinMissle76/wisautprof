39	Surprised that we have spent more time and effort choosing a pram than we did the house .  Lucky I wasnt pregnant when house hunting . 
39	 @ nicktaylor amazingly no injuries anywhere ,  hope it stays that way .  Awesome emergency services .  High tide at 1 . 
39	 @ nicktaylor no we are fine here ,  few friends ,  school pupils flooded and evacuated . 
39	 @ rachelmann11 Welcome to twitter xx

39	 @ neilpd what was he doing there then ? 
39	My money is on seabass and shackalackaboomboom  # grandnational
39	 @ SanjayWills I personally fancy Sunnyhillboy good odds at 20 : 1 ,  think he may have a chance of doing well . 
39	Not a bad night ,  thankyou  @ neilpd for not being too miserable !   # notquitetghetimeofhislife
39	and  @ neilpd are very excited to go see  # anightofdirtydancing tonight .  Well have the time of our life .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
39	 @ DyfrigWilliams think he and scarlets will benefit from him being a coach elsewhere first .  maybe in 2 years time after turning wasps around . 
39	 @ DyfrigWilliams yes ,  think its the best way forward ,  hes not ready to retire but hoping scarlets will have him back as a coach in 6 yrs
39	lost sympathy for those that say they work 48 wks of the year .   @ neilpd   &   @ DyfrigWilliams no work to do ?   # cloggingmytwitterfeed
39	aha  # missionpossible the word free became the keyword .  5 emails later I have company !  !  Thankyou Cambrian News . 
39	Just won tickets for  # anightofdirtydancing now how do i convince neil to take me .   # missionimpossible  ?  ? 
39	 @ ljhdScarlets Obviously not following enough of them !  !  Nice to know though x
39	 @ Matthew _ Rees _ 2 First player I have seen to wish Stevo well ,  was starting to think noone liked him !  ? 
39	 @ ljhdScarlets Think Jones could do well for the Wasps assuming they dont go into administration . 
39	 @ ljhdScarlets I reckon he will be back as a coach after perfecting his skills elsewhere . 
39	Great to see  # StephenJones trending ,  but wish he was on twitter and going somewhere a bit better . 
39	Almost want to lose my phone so I can sing  # wheremykeys  # bgt
39	 @ ShaneWilliams11 hope you are hitting aber town tonight ! 
39	What a difference an hour makes ,  up and ready for a busy week !   # easterholscountdown

39	 @ Nigelrefowens Getting mine for my birthday .  . 4 days to go ,  but the hoodie is still by the front door in a sealed packet and I cant open it . 
39	Changed my opinion of  @ mikephillips009 tonight .  Impressed .

39	 @ ljhdScarlets absolutely but he always said he was available til he wasnt wanted / needed .  nice one for scarlets names .  . bugging me . 
39	 @ ljhdScarlets  .  .  .  .  . unless serious injuries happen which wont do anyone any good . 
39	 @ ljhdScarlets you dont think he has chosen to play scarlets over baa - baas ?  who is 3rd no10 ?  sadly think hes played his last wales game .  .  . 
39	Fed up with all the press about Stephen Jones .  .  .  .  . hed never have planned his last game .  Out of pub eye during intl career and after .   # No10
39	Jamie Roberts and his crossroads 
39	 @ neilpd 
39	First of the night informed me that he was on a diet ,  ungrateful so and so !   # trickortreating

39	Not liking the smell / sound of pumpkin soup ,  possibly the only american tradition I dont like . 
39	My pet hate :  people smiling and laughing when giving bad news . 
39	He destroyed my chicken during the inspection process .  There is a reason why I dont bother cooking . 
39	Well the chicken looks ready .  What veg to peel next ?  Hoping Neil sees my plea for help . 
39	Should probably start the roast dinner , but wouldnt like to spoil it . Would be very sad end to a chickens life to have me attempt cooking it
39	Beef burger in the harbour master .  Wrong ?  No absolutely delicious . 
39	Having a bad day already .  Thank god it is Friday

39	has been lambing ,  now thats a hard days work !  ! 
39	wondering why 4 day weekends cant happen every week ,  loving this
39	concerned at my lack of guitar hero skills . 
39	No1 day of celebrating gone well ,  sleep now ready for no2 .  youll all get bored of this way before day 6 . 
39	is wondering why emergency appointments cant be made to fit into your busy schedule .  .  .  . aaaaaw !  ! 
39	has had a perfect weekend ,  what a shame its monday again tomorrow .  although xmas day no1 next weekend should be fun  : o ) 
39	can easily fill a suitcase with 15kg ,  but how do i fill a small rucksack with 10 kilos to make the most of the allowance .  .  .  .  . bricks ? 
39	is looking forward to school trip no .  1 tomorrow
39	cant believe that leaving aber is looking appealing right now . 
39	is still in shock .  Only Neil would buy a car for Â£130 . 
39	doesnt think that Neil should be allowed to own a car .   : op
39	is ready for the weekend .  .  . and next school holidays .  .  . four weeks and one day to go .
