-1	 @ Demolition71 I still think someone will get two yellows .  Possibly more likely now ?  ! 
-1	 @ Demolition71 I thought it was soft at first ,  but the more I see it ,  the more I think it was deliberate .

-1	 @ MrXile Heh !  Just dont expect an Apatow type comedy . 
-1	 @ DanRebellato All of them ?  !  Thats bad luck . 
-1	 @ MrXile Its a goodun .  Mostly improvised ,  too  -  bar the main beats of the plot . 
-1	Heres the trailer for  # ClearHistory .  Sky Atlantic ,  9pm .  
-1	 @ MrXile Yo !  Dunno if youve given Curb a go yet ,  but you should check out Clear History at 9pm on Sky Atlantic :  
-1	 @ LfcDan  @ PaulEdwards1973 Wow .  Way to fuck up an average joke .  Bob - a - job threat *  . 
-1	 @ LfcDan  @ PaulEdwards1973 We should call in a bob - a - job scare . 
-1	 @ ParaIIeIs I just retweeted a really nice shot of Liverpool Town Hall .  .  .  . worth a look .

-1	Es ist sehr windig ,  ja ?  ! 
-1	 @ Gregor31 Youre gonna miss all the wickets ! 
-1	 @ EdinburghTrams  @ WelshIrvine I knew it had taken a while to lay those tracks ,  but .  .  .  . 
-1	But ,  yknow ,  best of luck making them fucking regret booing you ,  you absolute whopper . 
-1	Im not being funny ,  right ,  but youd think that ,  after eleven years ,  Moyes wouldve got on to why  # EFC fans are known as bitters . 
-1	 @ Aphiyalil They hardly ever stay forever .  I just want him to win something with us .  If we could win the league ,  he would stay a lot longer ! 
-1	 @ AP _ McCoy Quite right too ,  champ ! 
-1	 @ AP _ McCoy  @ Robbie9Fowler Only by default ,  AP  ;  )

-1	 @ sportingintel  @ david _ conn  @ BarbaraBell17 Dont forget Canal Street . 
-1	 @ arepeejee  @ sallonoroff  @ dansumption When my boss loses EE4G it takes ages  ( around an hour )  to come back  & amp ;  doesnt default him to 3G . 
-1	 @ arepeejee  @ dansumption One more thing ,  when 4G launches this (  ?  )  month I get it for no additional cost ,  and retain unlimited data .
