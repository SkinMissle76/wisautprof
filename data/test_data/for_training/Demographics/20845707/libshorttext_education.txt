2	Really wanna treat myself to some fast food to cheer myself up .  But which ?   # kfc  # mcdonalds  # dominos  ? 
2	Just watched the  # christmas  # drwho again .  It simply stuns me at how emotional it is . 
2	Yes it was City and Chelsea but those points could be the difference between winning the league and finishing 2nd / 3rd  # lfc
2	We didnt deserve to come away from those two games with injuries and no points .  In both games wrong decisions ruined it  # lfc  # fa
2	I woke up very hungover to see a strange  # batlady on tv .  What has happened to channel 4 ? 
2	 # starwars 
2	Awesome game  # xbox 
2	Literally done nothing but wake up past 11am ,  get drunk ,  eat takeaways and play xbox .  Not even gone outside for the last 3 days  # christmas
2	has just ordered at Zam Zam through 
2	My head is killing me .  The pains are getting worse  # pain
2	 @ GeordieLass _  yes we lost but thats not the point .   .   . 
2	 @ GeordieLass _  newcastle are 4th in MOTD in 2mins .  But if you want to see class ,  watch the first game !   # liverpool
2	 @ SuperSubLFC especially when you consider citys bench  # talent

2	 @ GeordieLass _  whats yours ? 
2	 @ GeordieLass _  yeah its :  jamesybaby33
2	Purely down to pressure and inexperience for Sterling  # lfc
2	 @ GeordieLass _  i hope you didnt go in your pants and shirt like your pics .  No wonder the Stoke players got distracted ! 
2	 @ GeordieLass _  youll love MOTD .  They talk about it after and do some slow mos so you can see it all x x
2	 @ GeordieLass _  could you not see ?  I didnt have you down as a MOTD lass x
2	Joe Hart has been superb .  Proving why hes our number 1  # lfc  # mcfc  # england
2	This is basically our world cup game  # suarez  # hart  # lfc  # mcfc
2	I would still choose Agger over Skrtel anyday  # lfc
2	 @ GeordieLass _  was a very exciting match to watch as a neutral
2	 @ Liddellpool very slow and takes a few seconds longer than everyone else to notice something
2	Even though we are 2 - 1 down this is a cracking game to watch  # lfc  # mcfc
2	Currently surrounded by asians  # fml
2	Would be very happy with a draw .  The winner of this game will win the league mark my words  # lfc  # mcfc  # tough
2	has just ordered at Zam Zam through 
2	Merry Christmas
2	Just proves .  Youre only ever happy by yourself

2	 @ BBCMOTD  # mancity
2	Boom !  !   # suarez  # lfc
2	I dont understand why he doesnt either play or sell Agger ?  Hes a cracking player  # lfc
