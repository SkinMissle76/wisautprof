3	I bought a pot of olives for 19p today ,  Im not even bothered about eating them but why wouldnt you buy them for 19p ? 
3	Man U are good ,  lol . 
3	My favourite thing about Christmas ?  The endless social network dick - waving about how people are being so Christmassy . 
3	 @ littlestpicshow Nah ,  I still find Anchorman funny each time I watch it .  Same for Step Brothers ,  The Other Guys and Talladega Nights . 
3	 @ DJBentley Well ,  I like the taste of Nazi pizzas .  Theyre delicious . 
3	Is Dr Oetker a real doctor ?  Is a pizza doctor a real thing ?  I just need to check before I research into qualifications and stuff .

3	 @ jamiedurent Im just Banta Claus ,  spreading shitty Christmas cheer . 
3	 @ charliebutlin92 Well ,  it is when you have a santa hat on it . 
3	Ive decided not to read any Anchorman 2 reviews because it generally takes about five watches to realise how great Adam McKay films are . 
3	I also found out that I won some books in a raffle ,  signed them as the author and then donated them to charity and they were then all sold . 
3	I just got in and ate a Krispy Kreme doughnut ,  Ive not even had a drink .  Im just really spiritually connected with food .  We just click . 
3	Just waiting for Tenacious D to arrive .  
3	 @ IncredibleSuit Oh boy . 
3	FYI ,  them Morrisons 2 for £5 ready meals are pretty dope .  One meal ,  one pot . 
3	Hands down the best part of any LOTR or Hobbit film is the music booming and them walking across fields .

3	Rounding off Christmas Day with The Rock on Blu - Ray . 
3	Fucking hell .  Its over .   # grownups2
3	Just a heads up ,  New Girl is hands down the funniest TV show going at the moment .  Archer probably will be on a par when its back . 
3	Id like to wish  @ iFlicks all the luck in the world as he embarks on the first of the  # 12DaysofNetflix on  @ VODzillaMag . 
3	Theyre generally funny on first watch and then just get funnier each viewing thereafter . 
3	So ,  22 Jump Street looks exactly as good as Id hoped it would be . 
3	Set List :  Stand - Up Without A Net on Sky Atlantic is just fantastic . 
3	Luis Suarez is different class . 
3	I may or may not live - tweet it ,  so if you feel like being vaguely amused at my misfortune .  Keep looking at my words . 
3	Im enjoying Fringe ,  the second season is a lot better than the first .  However ,  22 episodes per season is stupid and always was . 
3	I really love Anchorman and Im looking forward to the sequel ,  but the marketing is starting to test me a bit .

3	I say this ,  but its wasted on my family . 
3	If I cared less about my health or money ,  I would definitely eat Walkers Cheese  & amp ;  Onion grab bags at least 40 times a day . 
3	Writing jokes is so old school .  Its much funnier if you spend the film making fun of people .   # grownups2
3	 @ evejanine Hes done what ?  ! 
3	Come at me Anchorman 2 ,  bathe me in your comedy ,  touch me so tenderly in my funny bone .
