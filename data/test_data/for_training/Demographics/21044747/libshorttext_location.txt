11	You think Sherlock was the best thing on telly tonight ?  Well ,  you clearly havent seen this feature - length Britney Spears thing on ITV2 . 
11	Im a bit pissed and I think I formally denounced any kind of belief system tonight .  So ,  HAPPY HOLIDAYS . 
11	 @  _ ashjadexo Youll always need toilet paper and it doesnt go off . 
11	Ive watched The Rock and Armageddon in the past two nights .  Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay need to get together again . 
11	So ,  Im basically a godless fraud .  YAY ! 
11	 @ evejanine Theres no need ,  its stepping on the vibes .  I assume more booze will sort it probably . 
11	Good work Nelson ,  sleep easy .  Rest in peace . 
11	Tonight Ill be live - tweeting the Jim Carrey mo - cap Christmas Carol for  @ VODzillaMags  # 12daysofnetflix if any of you want to join . 
11	It seems no one saw my previous tweet .   * clears throat *  BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIGNONS . 
11	Positively ecstatic with the news that Welcome To The Jungle  ( The Rundown in the USA )  is getting a sequel .  Ditto Bad Boys 3 . 
11	Cant be doing with people who get chips with their curry .  Wronguns . 
11	Netflix UK seems to be removing roughly all of its content next week .  Oh good . 
11	And I got a fruit salad for 65p .  Its no 19p ,  but Ive basically got two side dishes for nothing .  TAKE THAT CLEGG ! 
11	The Sunday Times Culture reveals a couple of Anchorman 2 cameos .  Just in case you wanted to see it without prior knowledge .

11	Now this hangover is on the way out .  Time to eat all of the things . 
11	Just watching Fringe and this episode has an 80s style credit sequence .  Bloody brilliant . 
11	I bought a pot of olives for 19p today ,  Im not even bothered about eating them but why wouldnt you buy them for 19p ? 
11	Man U are good ,  lol . 
11	My favourite thing about Christmas ?  The endless social network dick - waving about how people are being so Christmassy . 
11	 @ littlestpicshow Nah ,  I still find Anchorman funny each time I watch it .  Same for Step Brothers ,  The Other Guys and Talladega Nights . 
11	 @ DJBentley Well ,  I like the taste of Nazi pizzas .  Theyre delicious . 
11	Is Dr Oetker a real doctor ?  Is a pizza doctor a real thing ?  I just need to check before I research into qualifications and stuff . 
11	This is a democracy ,  survival of the fittest . 
11	I had mushroom pate on toast this morning .  Breakfast of champignons . 
11	 @ charliebutlin92  "  @ YOSushi :  50 of your favourite plates on our belt for £2 . 50 .

11	 @ samashurst Its just perfect .  This year has produced two of my favourite comedy films and ready to openly receive a third for Anchorman 2 . 
11	 @ jamiedurent Im just Banta Claus ,  spreading shitty Christmas cheer . 
11	 @ charliebutlin92 Well ,  it is when you have a santa hat on it . 
11	Ive decided not to read any Anchorman 2 reviews because it generally takes about five watches to realise how great Adam McKay films are . 
11	I also found out that I won some books in a raffle ,  signed them as the author and then donated them to charity and they were then all sold . 
11	I just got in and ate a Krispy Kreme doughnut ,  Ive not even had a drink .  Im just really spiritually connected with food .  We just click . 
11	Just waiting for Tenacious D to arrive .  
11	 @ IncredibleSuit Oh boy . 
11	FYI ,  them Morrisons 2 for £5 ready meals are pretty dope .  One meal ,  one pot . 
11	Hands down the best part of any LOTR or Hobbit film is the music booming and them walking across fields . 
11	We dont have Thanksgiving in the UK because theres no requirement historically to thank people for allowing themselves to be conquered . 
11	Just plundered my Christmas bonus and a sizeable chunk of my wage on a PS4 .  Im an idiot . 
11	 @ charliebutlin92  @ UberFacts 
11	I just dropped some pepperoni onto my bed .  Maybe this is a sign I should turn back ?   # grownups2
11	Geordie Michael from Alan Partridge appears in Hebburn set in the North East but doesnt play a Geordie .  My brain just fell out of my ears .

11	 @ chrismayerV1 Liverpool United ? 
11	 @ littlestpicshow Coming in stock next week on Amazon ,  not sure for how long itll be available . 
11	Its mostly just people screaming I think .  There was a bit where Britney kept shouting  " work bitch "  during her British promo too . 
11	Rounding off Christmas Day with The Rock on Blu - Ray . 
11	Fucking hell .  Its over .   # grownups2
11	Just a heads up ,  New Girl is hands down the funniest TV show going at the moment .  Archer probably will be on a par when its back . 
11	Id like to wish  @ iFlicks all the luck in the world as he embarks on the first of the  # 12DaysofNetflix on  @ VODzillaMag . 
11	Theyre generally funny on first watch and then just get funnier each viewing thereafter . 
11	So ,  22 Jump Street looks exactly as good as Id hoped it would be . 
11	Set List :  Stand - Up Without A Net on Sky Atlantic is just fantastic . 
11	Luis Suarez is different class . 
11	I may or may not live - tweet it ,  so if you feel like being vaguely amused at my misfortune .  Keep looking at my words . 
11	Im enjoying Fringe ,  the second season is a lot better than the first .  However ,  22 episodes per season is stupid and always was . 
11	I really love Anchorman and Im looking forward to the sequel ,  but the marketing is starting to test me a bit . 
11	 @ robbiereviews My finger is hovering over the unfollow button as we speak .  I had one installed on my keyboard specially .

11	 " Release the world engine !  "   -  Release the worst line from a film in 2013 . 
11	 @ susieblues Im on Season 2 which is a lot better ,  I heard it improves so I stuck with it ,  Season 1 ends strongly but mostly a bit rubbish . 
11	Top t - shirt game .  
11	Yes ,  Im eating all of the breadsticks .  No ,  Im not going to give even distribution of dips to all of the multipack . 
11	 @ charliebutlin92 Pyorrrr beauer n that
11	If the Anchorman 2 actors sing Afternoon Delight at every single premiere ,  when does it stop being newsworthy ? 
11	 @ littlestpicshow Check Stock Informer ,  shows where has got it in stock .  They keep going quick though . 
11	Just watching Munich :  Revenge of the Jews .  I think that was the subtitle anyway . 
11	Ill be live - tweeting  # Scrooged on  @ NetflixUK over at  @ VODzillaMag in just over 20 mins .  Join me .   # 12DaysofNetflix
11	I say this ,  but its wasted on my family . 
11	If I cared less about my health or money ,  I would definitely eat Walkers Cheese  & amp ;  Onion grab bags at least 40 times a day . 
11	Writing jokes is so old school .  Its much funnier if you spend the film making fun of people .   # grownups2
11	 @ evejanine Hes done what ?  ! 
11	Come at me Anchorman 2 ,  bathe me in your comedy ,  touch me so tenderly in my funny bone . 
11	Last year was 12 months long and I hope the new year continues in roughly the same trajectory . 
11	 @ charliebutlin92 Bullshit .   "  @ UberFacts :  Elephants have a sound for when they find a place infested with bees  -  Its called a  " bee rumble .  "  " 
11	Caught the last half hour of Dark Knight Rises on Sky .  Still brilliant . 
11	 @ chrismayerV1 The Circle sounds like one of those secret branches of the CIA . 
11	 @ evejanine I think that was the point where I gave up .  I just couldnt hack it any longer .  Decided to binge on Entourage instead . 
11	 @ carlgreenwood I think theyre going to be pushing it from next year ,  but theyve got the basics there and got them right . 
11	 @ littlestpicshow Ive got a bundle with Battlefield and Killzone and will probably get FIFA for it as well later on . 
11	 @ chrismayerV1 I did not know this .  To the googles I go . 
11	Manchester United are good .  Lol . 
11	 @ CalumRogers I only had 2 days to get rid of the injured Ramsey .  Its not enough time to panic buy .

11	 @ Gatsbyspants  " Our shampoo is so good ,  youll need to wipe out a whole race of people to get exclusive usage .  " 
11	If someone asked me what I like most about the PS4 ,  my honest answer would be that the menu music is really soothing . 
11	Foxs airing of Louie is bizarre .  Showed the penultimate three - parter at the beginning of the series and are then re - airing it at the end . 
11	Ive sworn over 101 times on Twitter ,  so Im on Santas naughty list .  What a sack of cunts .

11	 @ carlgreenwood I really want it to work but I feel like theyre trying too hard to emulate Marvels thing and they have spent years on it . 
11	 @ charliebutlin92  @ UberFacts Bullshit . 
11	Homeland was finally pulling it round in the last episode and they didnt bother capitalising in the latest episode .  Idiots . 
11	Im watching the first Hobbit film .
