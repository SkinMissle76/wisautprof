-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Ill join you on that one . 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Dont ask about the  # FACup  .  .  .   ( currently losing 1 - 0 away at Rochdale )  . 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  BDO was the first darts I got into so I love it .  The quality isnt as good as PDC though so doesnt pack quite the same punch . 
-0.46	 -   @ Leeds _ Gary  -  If theyre playing anything like they did in the Blackburn first half ,  then I can see why itd be easy for Rochdale . 
-0.46	 -   @ Leeds _ Gary  -  Unfortunately its becoming a rather tedious and predictable time of year for  # LUFC around January . 
-0.46	 -   @ Leeds _ Gary  -  None at all is best .  But it doesnt stop you from reading the score and shaking your head in dismay .   # LUFC  # FACup
-0.46	 -  FFS !  !  You are joking .  .  .  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !   # LUFC  # FACup
-0.46	 -   @ Victooooria _   -  Are they on sale yet chick ?  Just checked both Crash Records and Jumbo Records and neither show tickets online yet . 
-0.46	 -  Are you ready ?  !   # BDOdarts
-0.46	 -   @ Victooooria _   -  Oh thatll be fine then  =  )  Traams is an excellent choice by the way .  Saw them at Beacons and enjoyed them .  x
-0.46	 -   @ Victooooria _   -  Heeeey !  It should be open from midday today  =  )  x
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  BDO darts starts tomorrow  =  ) 
-0.46	 -   @ Leeds _ Gary  -  Youre right about it not being easy supporting Leeds ,  Gary !  But theyre our team .  .  .  Lets see what tomorrows Cup brings ! 
-0.46	 -  Did I just witness  @ frankturner win Celebrity Mastermind .  .  .  ?  !  Aaaaace !  Well done fella ! 
-0.46	 -   @ richlay  -  Thank you darlin  =  ) 
-0.46	 -   @ richlay  @ leedsmusicscene  @ Carnabells  -  Looks like youre gonna have to put more gigs in the diary for 2014 fellas .  Shame  ; o ) 
-0.46	 -  “ @ leedsmusicscene :  If anyone is interested ,  heres the top Leeds giggers of 2013 :  
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Aw man that was so close to being 5 - 6 .  That final worked out better than we thought .  MvG the worthy winner . 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Terrible .  I dont know whats more shocking .  .  .  The fact MvG has conceded 4 sets or your last joke  = P
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  What about the darts now ?  !  Could you be right .  .  .  ?   ; o ) 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Biggest double tops of Snakebites life .  Gutted he missed it . 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Hmm .  .  .  Thatd be the dream wouldnt it ?  !  Cant see it happening though . 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  Everyone loves an underdog .  .  .  But this is worse than MvGs semi - final where he destroyed Lewis .  Not exciting at all .   # Darts
-0.46	 -   # Sherlock
-0.46	 -   @ Leeds _ Gary  -  But why is it they only show strength and determination in the closing stages when its too late ?  Typical Leeds aye ?  !   ; o ) 
-0.46	 -   @ Leeds _ Gary  -  It was a case of being outplayed and outclassed today too Im afraid .  Especially in midfield .  .  . 
-0.46	 -   @ kedgar93  -  MvG is a beast .  I think hes got Snakebite well and truly rattled here ! 
-0.46	 -  Overall disappointed with  # LUFC today .  Great efforts in the second half but I think too much damage had been sustained in the first half . 
-0.46	 -   # MatchDay  # LUFC
