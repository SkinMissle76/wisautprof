-0.34	Some interesting opinion in the comments on the  # saintsfc /  # clattenburg row !  
-0.34	 @ wez Ive met her with the massive cans .  She was annoying . 
-0.34	 @ DeanoBaggio83 Ha ! 
-0.34	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert its a gamble not to go full strength in the early rounds .  Wigan got away with it last year . 
-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 That is true ,  but I dont think he has ever looked particularly comfortable .  To progress we need better options .

-0.34	Tomorrows referee Bobby Madley last reffed  # saintsfc in the 0 - 3 loss to  # wba last season .  Sent 3 players off  -  all correct .   # twitterclarets
-0.34	 @ BileysMullet  @ PompeyNev  @ rmbyres Weve done this too .  Still no evidence ,  Saints fans I know believe it was suggested but not implemented . 
-0.34	 @ upthesaints  @ Metro _ Sport Means to an end .  .  .  . 
-0.34	We cant risk Jos or Maya in the Premier League .  Sorry to say it ,  but they arent anywhere near good enough .   # saintsfc
-0.34	Amazing that there is more interest in the  # saintsfc / Clattenburg complaint than Brendan Rodgers questioning a refs impartiality .  .  .  .

-0.34	Who do we want in the 4th round then ?  Id like Cov away ,  or any other Midlands away .  Otherwise a simple home tie .  .  .   # saintsfc
-0.34	 @ upthesaints Its underhand and doesnt look good ,  but a period without his reffing prevents as much damage ,

-0.34	 @ Toothy73  @ PompeyNev No but there isnt a special designated section for them ! 
-0.34	 @ Jon _ Margetts It would be a massive gamble ,  I dont think Ings is good enough to replace him ,  not even same type of player . 
-0.34	 @ Maverick85P Yep other than age and pace ,  Rickie is a far better player . 
-0.34	If  ( big IF )   # saintsfc get a decent period without Clattenburg this will have been a masterstroke .  .  . 
-0.34	I can only hope playing the keystone cops at centre half was a nudge to Mr .  Cortese to get his chequebook out .  .  .   # saintsfc

-0.34	 @ ConnorArmstrong Seaborne is on loan at Coventry . 
-0.34	Scarily it seems some  # saintsfc fans would cash in on Rickie and replace with Ings . 
-0.34	 @ cdvdtz Id go . 
-0.34	 @ HeyGeno I wouldnt have thought so ! 
-0.34	Forest have got  # whufc tied up in NOTTS .   # nffc  # hereallweek
-0.34	That injury is bad news for England .  Walcott without doubt a starter in best XI . 
-0.34	 @ HantsOnlyTeam Let them have their day Nick ,  they dont get many ! 
-0.34	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert Modern fans bored of same old teams winning it ,  and clubs would rather come 4th in the league . 
-0.34	 # saintsfc have inadvertently made Mark Clattenburg some sort of hero .  That is some going ! 
-0.34	Poor attendance today .  If you want club to take cup seriously perhaps you should too .  .  .   # saintsfc
-0.34	 @ PompeyNev No problem with that .  Use of the word embarrassing by fans of some clubs deliciously ironic though .  .  .

-0.34	 @ Baldsaint He told Japanese media that he can leave and is in talks with Marinos . 
-0.34	 @ alex _ crook  @ Joe _ Batchelor Interesting that it is a bigger deal than Rodgers who accused a ref of impartiality ! 
-0.34	 @ upthesaints Leaked at other end I was told .  .  .  . 
-0.34	So this is what Cliff Richard was on about .  .  .   # livingdolls
-0.34	 @ MattSmithSFC Dreadful . 
-0.34	 @ HeyGeno  @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert Add to that having final on same day as league fixtures ,  late kick offs etc .  its no longer special . 
-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 He was awful on Saturday .  I cant believe anyone would think otherwise . 
-0.34	 @ PompeyNev Point is weve had him plenty of times and it hasnt evened out yet .  Dont want to sound paranoid ,  but evening out is a myth . 
-0.34	 # shelfie 
-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 They arent nonsense ,  he gave the ball away at the back too often to be trusted . 
-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 On Saturday he barely completed a single pass . 
-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 Low blow because I dont agree with you on the abilities of a player ?  Fair enough . 
-0.34	 @ PompeyNev Incompetent .  Saints have not won a game hes taken charge of and been victim of several poor decisions .

-0.34	 @ BembridgeFish It doesnt ! 
-0.34	 @ rich _ parker I hope youre joking with Shawcross .  We need defenders who are comfortable with the ball at their feet ! 
-0.34	Im not saying Ings is a bad player ,  but more like JRod than Lambert .  Would be a big gamble .   # saintsfc
-0.34	 @ GGalpin95  @ Mike7167  @ Maverick85P I thought he was playing well until the knock . 
-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 Fair point ,  but has been dreadful this season .  We need defenders comfortable on the ball the way we play . 
-0.34	Now well see a lot more of Andros .  Potshot Townsend .  Sigh . 
-0.34	 @ nicetrainers  @ saintgert Seen loads of fans on here talking about taking it seriously ,  yet tickets not selling .   # hypocrites
-0.34	 @ SassyBrew1  @ Baldbarbarian  @ GGalpin95 Asking questions is fine ,  its the ones who are making screechy noises and arent interested in game . 
-0.34	 @ PompeyNev I firmly believe it is all a ruse to get Clattenburg away from our games .  Worked for Chelsea and Everton  . 
-0.34	Imagine being so incensed at an opposition player telling you the score you already knew that you pelted stretcher bearers with coins .  .  . 
-0.34	Well we got away with that .  .  .   # saintsfc  # twitterclarets
-0.34	 @ DeanoBaggio83 What were they ? 
-0.34	 @ PompeyNev I find the reasoning bizarre ,  Saints should be complaining about his performance rather than his banter . 
-0.34	 @ PompeyNev Rodgers actually mentions where ref was from ,  I think hes got off lightly with that .

-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ upthesaints Sounds more plausible .  Weird that they would leak it ,  they must know what it looks like .

-0.34	 @ SteveGrant1983  @ SamDobson1 That doesnt make them wrong though does it ?  Unless you are suggesting that your opinion cant be questioned ?

-0.34	 @ minterrrr  @ HannahKMinter I thought the price was ok ,  fair enough on distance though . 
-0.34	 @ Maverick85P Have to admit ,  yesterday was first time I thought he might be off .  Didnt celebrate his goal really ,  looked sad .
