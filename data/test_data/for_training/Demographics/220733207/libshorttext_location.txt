15	 @ TheSalvagePress Alas ,  it isnt :  
15	Particularly fond of the playful tail on the cap Q in an otherwise austere upper case 
15	A good morning deep cleaning 4 rediscovered cases of grotesque metal type  @ typoretum 
15	Huge thanks to  @ TheSalvagePress   @ typographyIRL  @ DistillersPress  (  & amp ;  everyone else Ive forgotten )  for great hospitality in Dublin last w / e ! 
15	Many thanks to  @ davelab6  @ aoifemooney  @ ThomasPhinney  & amp ;   @ octaviopv for a fantastic weekend of  @ craftingtype !  Still buzzing
15	Happy days on the wharfedale press  @ typoretum 
15	I do love coming to work in the morning .  .  .  
15	Sneak peek at a recent commission weve had the joy of printing  @ typoretum from 16 line elongated sans  # woodtype 
15	Some more  # type goodness from the  @ typoretum .  Available at 
15	Yesterdays playtime 
15	Is anyone able shed some info on this beautiful 8pt Tuscan  @ typoretum ?   # letterpress  # woodtype 
15	A treasure from  @ typoretum :  Necessity is the mother of invention 
15	Some fantastic prints produced on the first 2013  # letterpress course today  @ typoretum .  Put that keyboard down and come get your hands dirty ! 
15	 @ NomadLetterpres  @ typoretum dont quote me but I think its Wilhelm Klingsporschrift
15	Productive afternoon destributing into space barges  @ typoretum 
15	Just posted a photo 
15	 @ iamsamknott Im shocked that it looks that good in CS .  .  .  Bravo ! 
15	After dark experiments  
15	Theyre here .  .  .  The new limited edition  ( 100 )  day of the dead  # letterpress broadside from  @ typoretum .   
15	To be unleashed in the coming week ,  watch out for the latest  # letterpress print to rise from  @ typoretum 
15	They wait for the cover of darkness .  .  .  
15	 @ fjorddesigns pulling the first impression of the new print from  @ typoretum 
15	Great for britain ,  bad for British musicians
15	Wheres the nwobhm ?  Sabbath ?  Zeppelin ?  Such a range of living talent ignored replaced by new artists covering other living musicians . 
15	Shame to see so few realistic musical heritage exports tonight . 
15	A good day !  First time
15	A blisteringly  ( literally !  )  good day printing with antique sans serif woodletter type on an 1888 wharfedale stop cylinder press . 
15	Had a fantastic time at  @ typoretum ;  friendly ,  accommodating ,  and some darn fine  # letterpress ! 
15	Lithographically printed Bembo does not make reading about Confucian social philosophy as accessible as it should be
15	 @ benlongden jan 19th :  Heathrow  -  Bangkok via kuala lumpur ,  returning April 25th :  Singapore  -  kuala lumpur ,  stay 2 days ,  then on to heathrow
15	Flights :  booked . 
15	Ethics ? 
15	Trying to watch  @ uniofexeter live graduation feed is like pulling teeth .  I give up . 
15	if i posted my entire dissertation on twitter ,  it would make up only 0 . 002571428571 %  of the average daily traffic . 
15	 @ Koire hes not to everyones tastes but he has such an odd talent .  Narrative .   +  dig lazarus dig was the first new vinyl I bought .  .  . 
15	 @ Koire 
15	 @ Koire I recommend Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds  " Dig Lazarus Dig "  ,  Paul Simons  " Graceland "  ,  or Jónsis  " Go "  .  All full of catchy material
15	if design is in tune with culture ,  is culture narrow and ostentatious ? 
15	is finding far too many contradictory accounts regarding dates of protogothic script .  it almost seems to not exist .  .  . 
15	 @ Koire enjoy ! 
15	but in the actual structure of the letters themselves . 
15	there are similarities in the letterforms as the source material is the same ,  but the spirit is different ,  not in the manner of typefaces .  .  . 
15	does blackletter ,  which came before our the current system and was also based on the carolingian script ,  exist as a typeface ,  or script
15	if romalingian types are convention for western reading practices ,  and developed from the carolingian miniscule and roman majuscule ,  .  .  . 
15	Just posted a photo 
15	 @ koire £275 for 5 days learning to draw Roman majuscules and letter carve in stone .  spend my year freelancing  &  learning traditional crafts
15	 @ koire funnily ,  thinking of freelancing a bit so would be useful .  Once checked dates i think im gonna book that workshop course . 
15	Love finding favourite songs of artists are covers of songs by favourite artists . 
15	 @ GoranSoderstrom depends on the context .  web communication is more like speech than literary writing ,  so italics can help with prosody
15	love stumbling on stuff that was very useful months ago .  The first 3000 words of my dissertation summed up by Georg Simmel in one paragraph
15	 @ Koire ermmm .  If i do ,  ill come straight to you ! 
15	 @ Koire yeah ,  good to catch up .  Making my escape from Graphic design by focussing on more type related areas so going to be a fun summer ! 
15	hmmm .  .  .  reply shortcuts not working in lion apparently .  Sis ,  that was for you . 
15	thatd be awesome .  got to make sure it doesnt clash with graduation stuff etc  ( dont think it does )  but foreplanning is always good . 
15	 @ Koire theres a workshop im interested in attending in cambridge in september .  Wondered if could swing being put up for a couple of days . 
15	 @ koire hey sis ,  are you still in cambridge the end of this year ? 
15	working with claws . 
15	Looking forward to gaining some experience in the black arts at the end of July .  First rung off the ladder of graphic design into type . 
15	 @ benlongden aye ,  have read it .  What brings you to the dark side this night ? 
15	 @ andjournal this conversation has reached a level of ambiguity Im too tired to process . 
15	 @ benlongden then sure we would not need them anyway ?  and they dont need to be 3 characters long .  Thats just greedy . 
15	 @ rob _ pratley but should a new system taking prosody into account be implemented to facilitate a grammatical system of digital communication & gt ; 
15	 @ benlongden but they are only used to fill a gap .  They have no function as tools of rhythm or syntax so need no punctuation ,  just spacing
15	nice little piece on the relation between type design and graphic design by Alejandro Paul in in 158 answers
15	 @ benlongden none .  just destroy emoticons
15	interesting .  Just read an old article from 2004 arguing that gutenberg may not have printed from moveable type . 
15	having finally put all my music back into my library after a reinstall ,  really enjoying shuffle . 
15	Lion ,  multiple transparent background  . PSDs in InDesign ,  and 4GB of RAM  =  slow .  Not even going to check page outs .  .  . 
15	a really nice  " j "  too
15	Exemplar has one of the nicest  " e " s ive stumbled upon .  Elegantly sophisticated but all the while relaxed .   
15	 " 158 Answers "  :  Really nice idea of thematically relevant interviews from  @ typemedia and  @ typotheque .  Look forward to giving it a read ! 
15	link :  
15	Fellow UCF students .  Chance to do a good thing :  help the WNY Book Arts Centre acquire a collection of wood type destined for ebay . 
15	just a bit of icon design and then another project finished
15	 @ andjournal Boom ! 
15	Judging by order number ,  its selling fast ! 
15	just pre - ordered a copy of  @ codex .  Looks fantastic
15	downloaded auto refresh for safari .  tomorrow is going to be a good day ! 
15	This has pretty much become an exercise in how far one can push the concept of the book cover as a means of providing info on the content
15	Books should always identify their own typefaces .  Just courtesy . 
15	oooh .  Glyphs is in the mac App store .  .  .  only £199 . 
15	Recommended reading :  
15	We should make today Monospaced day and celebrate those cocksure  " i " s
15	Sigh .  Pretty much counting the days until i dont have to do any more graphic design and can focus on where my passion is . 
15	The amount of skill necessitated never ceases to fill me with admiration 
15	To set it in a revival of / type inspired by the types of Francesco Griffo .  It was the first time punctuation was argued to be syntactical . 
15	A book of basic rules of punctuation for graphic design undergraduates :  only right after Aldus Manutius  ( the younger ) s orthographie ratio " 
15	Juſt found a digital facſimile of John Milton’s Paradiſe loſt from 1669 .  Muſt give it a read ſome time ſoon . 
15	Always like finding books in engliſh that uſe the long s in the text . 
15	 @ benlongden maybe ,  well see .  depends how long it takes me to try  &  find who printed Ben Jonsons  " English Grammar "  in 1640 with what types
15	This project is dangerous to my bank balance .  Need to resist buying new typefaces .  .  . 
15	Really wish I had the money for Sabon Next or FS Sally . 
15	 @ NickSherman agree completely :  
15	 @ Koire yeah .  poor bugger .  Still ,  6 - 13 months plus his age isnt bad for a siamese anyway ,  let alone pedigree
15	Its not in lion… yet .   Uninstall applications that use Helvetica as a UI font anyway… cant really do that with an OS . 
15	Oh no .  I hoped Apples use of Helvetica for screen would stay put on iOS .  Now its in Final Cut ?  Hopefully wont go system wide…
15	Google today :  Charlie Chaplins 122nd birthday .  Shame that the use of his iconic moustache with blackletter makes it look more like Hitler . 
15	Mmmm .  Meran light looks very nice .  quirky ,  but nice . 
15	Screen now works  ( consistently )  .  Now time to immerse myself in the forms of futura and indulge my love of fakir . 
15	considerably poorer but hopefully come tomorrow my screen may be usable when I want it to be ,  not when it wants to be
15	Finally have my mac back .  Dont try and install too many fonts at once when you have saved system restarting .  rebooting after a crash  =  pain
15	 @ miss _ mai they so often are
15	If were happy calling citizens  " consumers "  ,  why not go a step further :  just refer to people as  " statistics " 
15	Is the present too late in history to use a ligature using a long s in an identity ? 
15	 @ lgiffin89 Hello stranger .   :  ) 
15	
15	 @ benlongden possibly a bit broader .  Will help when youre back here . 
15	 @ rlntlss _ nlgst subsequentionale  =  the extra rationale for a project that is suggested by somebody else after you have completed it . 
15	After yesterday i still trust nothing I read online .  .  . 
15	Also ,  can  " neutrality "  be designed into a typeface ?  Forgetting use :  nuances of humanity from its designer surely remove dispassion / unbias ? 
15	worried when type selection can come down to  " maybe a nice serif ,  like Didot ?  "  F *  *  *  content ,  lets have a riot ? 
15	 @ benlongden Amen broheim
15	 @ benlongden Perhaps the most useful conversation of my life
15	 @ benlongden April fools day mate .  kind of an unimaginative take on it though .  crazy as i was googling helvetica myself a few minutes ago .  .  . 
15	Love it .  Business man with hurried phone calls and email checking .  Suddenly stops and starts playing street fighter on his iPhone .  .  . 
15	All in all ,  a good day !  The days I could spend in Fonstmiths bookshelf .  .  . 
15	Telescope  +  DSLR .  thats some impressive range 
15	 @ miss _ mai amen to that .  its amazing how little you can physically do in an hours solid and undistracted work…
15	 @ miss _ mai  :  )   .  Hopefully it makes sense - ish .  havent re read it since i put it up so may need to edit bits
15	the variety of design research :  one week its the association of blackletter to violent gang culture and black metal ,  the next its Ikebana . 
15	New article  @ andjournal  :  Traditional typesetting seems considerably heavier .  Nostalgia in leading :  a proposition . 
15	New AND Article written by yours truly :  
15	 @ miss _ mai oui ,  just a bit ! 
15	being a product of self promotion .  Its a design - obsessive view that fails to accommodate any philanthropic value within humanity . 
15	to being the end in itself .  what about the real end ?  charity ,  assisting relief efforts .  Can we please stop bitching about these posters as .  . 
15	Design is a means .  Arguing that japan posters for charity is done for self promotion in the design community reduces the process of design .  . 
15	I dont want to be in THAT design community .  Design is not an end .  Design is not the most important thing in the world ,  get over it . 
15	
15	Fantastic discussion with  @ benlongden about the  [  .  .  .  ]  of language .  A discussion through  @ andjournal soon on the nature of nuatré
15	Could it be more idyllic ?   ( although I would like some vellum or something ) 
15	Power cut .  Life  -  power currently  =  practicing some textualis prescissa and rotunda scripts by candlelight with a glass of wine .  .  . 
15	My Fraktur looks like Schwabacher .  .  .   ( unless i write badger  -  then everything looks dandy ) 
15	really ?  but its ostrich .  .  .  we dont get that kind of meat here in falmouth
15	 @ Koire WHATT ? 
15	I really like Cristina Paolis idea that blackletter in Mexico was essentially an albur  -  kind of like a euphemism / innuendo . 
15	Why does my external monitor always succumb to Finagles law ?  Come on apple .  .  . 
15	Think ive found the likely origin of blackletter types prolific usage in the californian underground scene .  Finally . 
15	 @ tmthy _ dnldsn that should read synonymous ,  not synchronous .  Twitters not an excuse for improper lexical choice
15	 @ tmthy _ dnldsn remember when like was about personal taste ,  not synchronous with terms like lol ?  i feel were etymologically regressing .  . 
15	 @ miss _ mai unless you work in advertising
15	 @ underware Working on a couple of projects this year that are punctuation related .  thanks for the link !  And AND is being printed this week ! 
15	New thing learnt today :   " Old English "  types are actually french . 
15	 @ benlongden Appeal to the masses =  maybe we can get this revival started .  All this new interest in Journey too .  I will bring them together .  .  ! 
15	For the cool condensed type user :  14th c .  textura  -  believed almost all miniscules could be built on the width of i .  Now thats narrow .  . 
15	Imagine it singing .  Hey ,  blackletter is German *  right ?  The Scorpions are german .  .  .  Perfect fit .     * yes ,  i know Rotunda is southern European
15	Were creatives .  .  .  diversify associations .  Open Spotify / iTunes ,  play Wind of Change by the Scorpions ,  and look at some rotunda .  .  . 
15	 @ miss _ mai hmmm .  i want to go back to le mans  :  ( 
15	 @ miss _ mai i win im afraid .  Stuck in library having slept 5 hours in 3 days trying to get my dissertation finished for the hand in tomorrow ! 
15	 @ kupfers Type  +  lettering  =  identical ,  bring personality to the skeletal ideal of the letter  &  function as artefacts instead of archetype
15	 @ kupfers dealing with this in dissertation ,  concluded that letters are archetypal ,  defined  &  restricted by conventions ,  relatively immutable
15	 @ miss _ mai know that feeling all too well
15	and i appear to not know how to link within twitter .  .  . 
15	
15	annoyed  @ BBC and others constant labelling of  " consumers "  .  I may buy things ,  but however homogenised culture becomes ,  im a citizen first . 
15	 @ miss _ mai contemporary is good .  Enjoy the concrete ! 
15	 @ miss _ mai Idealogically speaking ;  before the style trade off ,  ill keep with the modernism i think !  concrete ? 
15	 @ miss _ mai Not bad at all !  hows the architecture going ?  We need more modernism in cornwall . 
15	 @ alfredapp fantastic ,  thanks .  pretty much the only app that seems to be able to seamlessly search large libraries .  great work ! 
15	 @ alfredapp awesome ,  forgot to index .  am only getting album art work in the titlebar area though ,  not in the large box to the right
15	 @ alfredapp having problems pointing towards an itunes xml file on an external drive ,  is this possible ?
