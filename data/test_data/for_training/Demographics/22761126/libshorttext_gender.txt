-1	 @ NorthernRupert Ill be fine  -  Im not high profile !  !   :  ) 
-1	Is off downhill ski race training tonight  -  first time in 3yrs !   Must double check medical and life insurance before going ! 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar good point and I would agree that settlers do not help Israels position ,  although I understand their reaoning
-1	 @ AnisahHUx do you not appreciate free speech ?  
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 e . g .   " You have your religion and I have mine "  109 : 1
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 certainly not ,  but then again Im not relying on it !   ;  ) 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar more precision please Vincent ! 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 is referring to non Muslims as Kafirs racist or just derogatory ? 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx this was an isolated incident for which he was jailed and thrown out , 2yrs ago .  Get some perspective . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 depends on if you take all 3 books as gospel  ( forgive the pun !  ) 
-1	 @ AnisahHUx is that an explanation or an excuse ? 
-1	 @ forestcyclist  @ CyclingMikey  @ TfLOfficial makes sense .  In fact ,  why bother with anything that helps other road users notice you earlier ? 
-1	 @ HumairaMayet bizarre that in 2014 people can  ( a )  still be so ignorant  ( b )  verbalise it
-1	Lovely afternoon at  @ BristolHipp with family  @ veronica1458  ( 2 / 3 of the kids below are mine !  )  
-1	 @ alimhaider its a Worry Index  ;  ) 
-1	 @ wasim _ dr  @ AnisahHUx out of interest would an example of this be the perfect act of beheading of c800 Jewish men  & amp ;  boys at Banu Qurayza ? 
-1	 @ YusufAliHall  @ AyeshaaB96 are you referring to me ?  I which case which facts did I get wrong ? 
-1	 @ rhodri I think it means you just got punched in the eye
-1	 @ wasim _ dr do you have the figures if you include the Sira and Hadith ? 
-1	 @ CEMB _ forum is this tweet typical of British Muslims today ?  
-1	 @ AnisahHUx btw ,  criticism is useful ,  being patronising is not . 
-1	 @ LFBWaterFairy perhaps the Union Leaders arent up to the job as well ? 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _   @ redeader  @ TfLOfficial true ,  but that wasnt my point
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs occupies of what ,  exactly ?   You say any attack which indicates youd be happy with genocide ,  ethnic cleansing etc ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 Im simply saying what the books tell us he did  -  its not my opinion .  Can Muslims ignore Sahih Bukharis  & amp ;  Sahih Muslim ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 the denial of any God ?  What is Islams view of Kafirs ? 
-1	 @ islamicfreedom and if the Quran is the only book without mistakes ,  are the Sira  & amp ;  Haddith not without mistakes ?  Just curious  :  ) 
-1	 @ redeader  @  _ JustinGage _   @ TfLOfficial plenty of cyclists who dont give a damn either  -  saw x3 go straight thru red lights this morning ! 
-1	 @ CadburyUK my next family pic will be like this  -  where do I get the jumpers from ?  ?  ? 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ CEMB _ forum think youll find that as far as murder is concerned ,  Islam wins first prize ,  has for 1400yrs and still is
-1	 @ jessiesinger  @ WeLoveBath  @ CrossFitBath by a long way
-1	 @ JosephineCumbo but  @ stevewebb1 thinks autoenrolment is straightforward aswell  # noidea
-1	 @ AtheistDan _   @ fallenpastors I refuse to stand anywhere near you if theres lightning about ! 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _   @ redeader  @ TfLOfficial agreed ,  but its an issue nevertheless . 
-1	 @ AnisahHUx 19 people RT something that wasnt true .    Nice one . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 are all Kafirs disbelievers or unbelievers ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 disbeliever and unbeliever are subtly ,  but importantly ,  different .  The first is primarily based on active rejection
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 what part of that isnt cruel and violent ? 
-1	 @ HumairaMayet why would someones skin colour determine their language ability ? 
-1	 @ RainbowKash  @ Layla _ Murad erm ,  shouldnt that be  " there arent "   ?   ;  ) 
-1	Post Crimbo recycling with my little  elf !  
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx and thats the best you can do ?  Please show us more of your insightful satire  ;  ) 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 its just that very few people can read and understand Classical Arabic
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 the original version or a translated version ? 
-1	 @ erroneous _ zone if you mean a 2m tall dark object with no lights travelling at speed in a low light area ,  then no . 
-1	 @ simonclegg878 who said anything about looking at a phone ?  Bizarre . 
-1	 @ CyclingMikey  @ erroneous _ zone very likely ,  its a Sunday and there were lots of big words  ;  ) 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx if anyone wants to see how our British Muslims think ,  Ill be sure not to send them your way then ?    & lt ;  -  -  not satire
-1	 @ BDS4Justice  @ mrjammyjamjar Israeli patrols are required to have these sorts of numbers as a minimum ,  whoever the suspected criminal is
-1	 @ alimhaider what is this table ? 
-1	 @ IslamReligion which Moses story is correct ,  the Koran or the Bible version ,  both ,  or neither ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 you might need to define interest for me ! 
-1	 @ forestcyclist  @ CyclingMikey  @ TfLOfficial perfect answer
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar thats not my point ,  the point is they are surrounded ,  hence the need for robust borders
-1	 @ Drysuitdiver  @ CyclingMikey  @ TfLOfficial yes ,  if they dont use their lights appropriately ,  applies to any colour car
-1	 @ JosephineCumbo rubbish .  Temporary annuities already offer better value than lifetime annuities
-1	 @ CyclingMikey  @ erroneous _ zone cheers  :  )  will read asap
-1	 @ Emma _ Roberts _  its not his fault ,  hes only 4
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs who used Gods name to launch a drone attack ?  Usually its just  " fire " 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 which means you only have to be an unbeliever ,  you dont even have to steal camels ! 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar and thats where youve missed the point .  Israel is the enclave ,  surrounded on all sides by its enemies
-1	 @ Bobby35623616  @ HumairaMayet  @ Kk61Raoof if youre a recognised Islamic scholar ,  translate your last post into Classical Arabic . 
-1	 @ IslamReligion I prefer an open forum ,  thanks anyway  ;  ) 
-1	 @ SihamMirexo 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 just wondered how much you knew about Islam / Koran / Hadith / Sira
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 1 / 2 :  Koran of Mecca 73 . 10 :  Listen to what unbelievers say with patience and leave them with dignity
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _   @ redeader  @ TfLOfficial Im surprised at the level of opposition to cyclists helping themselves improve their visibility
-1	 @ DrGrumble  @ HumairaMayet if you read his letter ,  that happened 23 years ago
-1	 @ JackCutTheChord I expect I would .  But what if you had no lights either ?  Risk youre prepared to take ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 when you say you live by these texts ,  what do you mean ? 
-1	 @ shooterops  @ Cpl _ Owens well were sharing aircraft carriers ,  so why not ?  ?  ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx youre the satirical one ! 
-1	 @ islamicfreedom  @ MissMuslimah99 which version are you referring to ?  Dont Christians say the same about the Bible ? 
-1	 @ Cpl _ Owens  @ shooterops saves rewriting the drill manual too ! 
-1	 @ Brusidiom  @ Hala _ AlDabbousi  @ God _ Equals _ Sant its not lies ,  its fiction
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx Enjoy the free speech and freedom of choice granted to and secured for you is due to those soldiers you mock
-1	 @ simonclegg878 you said that I was looking at my phone whilst driving . 
-1	 @ Cpl _ Owens do they still send you to Collie for gong AWOL ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ CyclingMikey  @ erroneous _ zone show me the science ! 
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs and does this include Hamas attacks on Israel ? 
-1	 @ cavill _ kirsty 35cal each  :  ) 
-1	 @ BigBearF1 youre welcome  -  think of it as care in the community  ;  ) 
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs no hatred for Islam at all mate .   Ive lived  & amp ;  worked in the Middle East ,  so Im no armchair critic from afar
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 do you have the freedom in Islam to try or is it doctrine that you must ? 
-1	 @ Davie _ A Archie  ( 4 )  has just ext donated his pocket money !  
-1	 @ islamicfreedom does that include Egyptian Christians ?  
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs what were the last 3 countries invaded and converted by Judaism and Islam respectively ? 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _   @ redeader  @ TfLOfficial cyclists making themselves more visible to other road users earlier has got to be sensible
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 1 / 2 The Prophet cut off the hands and feet of the men belonging to the tribe of Uraina .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar erm ,  no ,  clearly not . 
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs wiki is your friend 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 what is Islams view of Kafirs ? 
-1	 @ CyclingMikey  @ TfLOfficial I meant in low light situations .  If you think its okay to wear dark clothing whilst cycling ,  good luck to you
-1	 @ BritishInsurers surely you meant lifetime annuity ?   # attention2detail
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs clearly they have ,  hence the Israeli Border Police  ;  ) 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _   @ redeader  @ TfLOfficial not doing that at all .  Cycling in poor lighting conditions without lights and / or hi vis isnt clever ! 
-1	 @ MarkDampier  @ JosephineCumbo  @ JohnRalfe1 his idea of a mega fund sounds a bit like NEST .  Govt to provide annuities ,   & amp ;  get rid of advisers ? 
-1	 @ kingofdawah is this all non believers or are you somewhat over generalising ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 can you tell me where I can find that in the 3 books ? 
-1	 @ forestcyclist  @ CyclingMikey  @ TfLOfficial ah but thats just making excuses for other peoples poor observation
-1	 @ IDLrossy what element of those women only pics demonstrates theyre not oppressed ? 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar amen to that  ;  ) 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 or 2 / 2 :  Koran of Medina 8 . 12 :  Give strength to believers ,  I will send terror into the unbelievers’ hearts ,  cut off their heads . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 Im a Kafir  ;  ) 
-1	 @ AnisahHUx think youll find that was an American soldier 8 years ago . 
-1	 @ RichSandersen  @ TheKamikazi  @ CEMB _ forum ooo ,  good comeback  :  ) 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ RichSandersen  @ CEMB _ forum when was that then ?  Your intellectual capacity is outstanding . 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar lots Im sure .  Israel defends  & amp ;  protects ,  whilst Islam expands  & amp ;  attacks .  Simples . 
-1	 @ Layla _ Murad all Kafirs are disbelievers arent they  ( we )  ? 
-1	 @ ImranHaidary9 actually its very unlikely that tattoos  & amp ;  drinking makes anyone more popular with kafirs
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar look up 6 day war as an example
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 2 / 2 and did not cauterise  ( their bleeding limbs )  till they died . 
-1	 @ wasim _ dr no answer ?  Didnt think so ! 
-1	 @ redeader  @  _ JustinGage _   @ TfLOfficial isnt that the colours of a bruise ? 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx definitely not ,  he should have got longer !  !  My point was that was one person  & amp ;  one isolated incident . 
-1	 @ Brusidiom I believe Islam has over 40 different words for slave ,  indeed the Prophet was a slave trader himself . 
-1	 @ KhilafahAl in other words  " we will terrorise anyone  & amp ;  everyone who is not a fully fledged member of our compassionate religion "  ? 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar If the attacks against Israel stop ,  Israel has no need to retaliate
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 you really havent read them at all have you ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 Im happy for you ,  but it doesnt answer my question  ;  ) 
-1	 @ mrjammyjamjar  @ vinjs answer the question city boy  ;  ) 
-1	 @ LSESUASH  @ RichSandersen  @ Leila _ Creative  @ y _ alibhai  @ NickyAACampbell Id bemore concerned with the rule to keep the injunctions of the Sunna
-1	 @ SarahCardy problem solved ,  look what I found !  !  !  !  
-1	 @ TfLOfficial it would be great if cyclists would wear bright colours .  All black might look cool to you ,  but youre invisible to motorists ! 
-1	3 new unfollowers and 14 new followers  ( hello !  hello !  )  in the last week .  Via 
-1	 @ itsSullyR  @ AnisahHUx whoever wrote that clearly has very little understanding of the Bible
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 its not about me  ;  )  You say that he was the perfect man ,  kind  & amp ;  caring ,  and that the verse Ive quoted is an example of this ? 
-1	 @ Bee _  _ Pee thought youd like it !  !  !  !   :  ) 
-1	 @ CyclingMikey  @ erroneous _ zone interesting study  -  does it measure the number of cyclists not involved in an RTC due to using hivis etc ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 Im quoting from the trilogy of your holy books .  And do you think that disbelievers are therefore criminals ? 
-1	 @ shooterops  @ Cpl _ Owens how much of that is cake ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 Im glad youve chosen that one and not Koran of Medina 8 . 12  ;  )  Wa alaikum assalaam
-1	 @ LFBWaterFairy perhaps going on strike doesnt actually work ? 
-1	 @ wasim _ dr what UK Newspaper is this ? 
-1	 @ jessiesinger its not a commercial gym with hundreds of machines etc  -  it does have lots of female members  & amp ;  great community spirit ! 
-1	 @ JackCutTheChord erm ,  nope .  And theyre on the footpath .  Im a keen cyclist ,  so get off your soap box . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 or  " I shall cast terror in the hearts of the kafirs .  Strike off their heads… "  8 : 12 .  This later verse takes precedence ! 
-1	 @ LFBWaterFairy I presume 1 of the 4 will now have to be female to enable multitasking ? 
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ RichSandersen  @ CEMB _ forum oh ,  and who said I was an atheist ?   You assume too much and inquire too little . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 I presume Muslims are meant to then follow Mohammeds example ,  in the same way Christians do with Jesus ? 
-1	 @ MyDeenIsSuccess  @ HumairaMayet lucky chickens .  Halal is a needlessly horrific ,  gruesome ,  slow ,  painful death for animals
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 plenty ,  I have lived and travelled widely .  I prefer Hungarian  ;  ) 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 best or perfect ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96  @ Bob _ Be _ Be  @ AtheistDan _  Aisha  -  have you read the Koran ?  If so ,  you must be one of the few who are fluent in Classical Arabic . 
-1	 @ islamicfreedom my ex wife always listened too .  .  .  . 
-1	 @ shooterops  @ Cpl _ Owens sorry to but in fellas  -  is the FAMAS replacing the SA80 ? 
-1	 @  _ JustinGage _   @ redeader  @ TfLOfficial I said poor lighting conditions ,  which is not just at night time . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 its not my religion ,  so I can be objective ,  and Im simply asking for your thoughts as you seem to have a very rosey viewpoint
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ AnisahHUx is that meant to be satirical ?   ;  ) 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 not the Sira then ? 
-1	Just changed my profile pic and now I have zero followers  & amp ;  following no one .  So I guess no one will read this ! 
-1	 @ mark395625  @ CyclingMikey Im a keen cyclist ,  I prefer to give other road users every chance to see me thanks anyway
-1	 @ TheKamikazi  @ CEMB _ forum get your calculator out 
-1	Getting a bit bored of After8s for breakfast
-1	 @ MikeyThurgs  @ erroneous _ zone  @ CyclingMikey surely not !  I thought he seemed such a helpful ,  open minded chap !  !   ;  ) 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 I think you may not have read either then .  How about Volume 8 ,  Book 82 ,  Number 795 for starters .  Was that not him ? 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 follow to the fullest extent ,  i . e .  replicate ?  That must be difficult ! 
-1	 @ erroneous _ zone I do already thanks .  Also ran a vry large bike shop for almost a decade ,  so I do understand cyclists and cycling
-1	First task of 2014  @  3am :  look after Archie  ( 4 )  who has developed a nasty earache to enhance his orrible cold  :  ( 
-1	 @ erroneous _ zone Im not .  Your logic is amazing .  Well done . 
-1	 @ AyeshaaB96 its called dualistic logic  ;  ) 
-1	 @ BearGrylls what make is the rollmat used on the  @ stephenfry wknd ?  Not  @ BritishArmy issue  ;  ) 
-1	 @ BigBearF1 might want to do separate one for the Welsh troops as the Welsh flag isnt included in the Union  Flag  ;  ) 
-1	2 tweeps followed  ( thank you !  )  and 1 unfollowed  ( goodbye !  )  me in the past week .  Thank you 
-1	 @ vinjs  @ mrjammyjamjar you need to read the history of Islam fella ! 
-1	 @ islamicfreedom apart from the blatant Circular Reasoning ,  does that mean Success isnt possible without one of those constituent parts ? 
-1	 @ TheCriminalBar  @ SuptPhilVickers I expect the  @ BritishArmy will have to cover for you aswell eh ?   ;  )
