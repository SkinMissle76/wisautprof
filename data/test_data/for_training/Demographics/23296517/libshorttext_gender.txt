1	 @ LexiMorgan26 I will FB you some stuff either tomorr or this week xx
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 recommend both !  If you dont have enough time do a hypnobirthing course I can recommend some apps you can download  & amp ; listen to
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 we have moved out of London so was very keen to meet people ! 
1	Off to my surgery this morning .  9 weeks post partum .   # lazyparttimefemaleGPs  # lifeofaGPpartner
1	 @ clarercgp  @ StephanieBlease I qualified in 2006 from  @ imperial rialcollege ; we were never warned about burnout / taught how to deal with stress
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 there are x3 childrens centres near me and they have really great stuff on . 
1	 @ hcwetherell  @ 246170  @ DrJohnCosgrove  @ drjohnbye I think hes also too busy with his 3 day a week private practice .  .  . 
1	 @ drraggarwal  @ mgtmccartney  @ DrKristinaKing  @ drlfarrell  @ PeteDeveson Return to clinical work in April . 
1	 @ hcwetherell unless you are friends or have very open privacy settings on your profile
1	 @ StephanieBlease I think they cost more than I earn .  .  .  !  I will prob end up with a mixture of nanny / nursery / family .  Will need 4days of care . 
1	 @ StephanieBlease agree .  A bit like labour .  .  .  ! 
1	This has caused my blood pressure to go up on this sunny morning  @ medicalwomenuk  # leanin  # womendoctors  .  .  .  
1	Is the NHS a good place to work for women ?  Join me for a live discussion today at noon :   # womeninhealthcare 
1	 @ hcwetherell are you in Tikos GP group on Facebook ?  There was a loooong discussion on there recently about nails between mostly female GPs ! 
1	 @ hcwetherell agree with your daughter !  Impressed she has a shellac kit as a teenager !  I recently tried OPI gels -  also great
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mariamcgoretti afraid I had a lot of private help -  post delivery husband decided to get a room .  NHS postnatal wards : hectic
1	 @ SteveKellGP What they dont know of course is Im going in today ,  a Saturday , to do some practice Mx work inc PPG .  9 weeks post partum . 
1	Back on twitter after a bit of an absence .  Realised twitter is good entertainment during 5am feeds  # lifeofanewmother
1	 @ hcwetherell  @ 246170  @ DrJohnCosgrove  @ drjohnbye It would mean a lot of my friends would owe money -  many have switched / left NHS !   # burnout
1	 @ drkimholt I just sent an e - mail to you  ( patients first account ) re .  an article in the next medical woman - let us know , thanks  @ medicalwomenuk
1	 @ clarercgp  @ StephanieBlease working as a doc has really changed -  not living with colleagues on site ,  shift patterns ,  EWTD -  all contributors
1	 @ medicalwomenuk Hope  # MWFConf13 goes well !  Xx P . S The flowers were amazing ,  thank you ! 
1	 @ asim137  @ StephanieBlease  @ NikkiKF sounds like a plan .  I get great ideas at 4am when up feeding .  Will see what I come up with tonight ha ha
1	 @ StephanieBlease that is my future too .  .  . will need to cut down bag / shoe / clothes expenditure  :  -  ( 
1	 @ StephanieBlease a friend just sacked her nanny after installing a nanny cam .  The story left me in angst .  Childcare decisions :   # newmumfear
1	 @ drgandalf52 I plan to write quite a few appraisal entries on the back of all of it ! 
1	 @ mattilg  @ brookmanknight such a small world .  My late friend David introduced me to her via twitter !  How are you ? 
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mustntgrumble  @ Trisha _ the _ doc If I feel Im sitting with new mums who arent being honest its a waste of my time
1	 @ julieread24 I know .  Me too .  Have felt annoyed all morning but really I should know better than to read something from  @ Mail Online
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mariamcgoretti Extremely helpful husband who can cope with not much sleep plus family nearby who are supportive -  Im lucky
1	 @ LorraineELLE you deserve a medal .  Already plotting how I can avoid it and my baby is only 8 weeks  # peppapigphenomenon
1	 @ DrFarahJameel because this is what  ( some )  doctors within the NHS seem to be great at :  having a whinge .   # boredalready  # takesomeaction
1	 @ mattilg oh wow ,  Im jealous !  I havent met Olivia !  Have heard about RNS -  friends with Jackie Collins & amp ; her sons  ( gastro sec )  -  see her yearly
1	 @ clarercgp  @ StephanieBlease completely agree .  but many seniors dont think there is a problem .  .  .  " it was worse in my day "  etc
1	 @ NikkiKF is this complete now or can anyone still contribute ?  Great work Nikki . 
1	 @ Chihao  @ dannymcg  @ themattmak  @ Lucy _ SSP cant believe that was nearly 10 years ago  # wheredoestimefly
1	 @ StephanieBlease feel bad that he will only be 6 months when I return to clinical work but as a GP partner dont have any other option . 
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ asim137  # tipforthefuture  # ohgawd  # bringbackrainbow
1	 @ stevenowottny ah ,  I have this to come .  .  .  !  How old ?  Mine is 8 weeks .  Dreading teething .   # newmumfear
1	 @ StephanieBlease More people would breastfeed with success if there was more support - we got advice from a private lactation consultant
1	 @ NikkiKF gorgeous profile pic  :  ) 
1	 @ jamie _ wallis why so little sleep ?   :  -  ( 
1	 @ Cleverestcookie  @ hcwetherell  @ StephanieBlease  @ kaybee1978 mine :  10day OPI gels , not worthy of a pic  # lifeofanewmother  # TweetYourNewYearNails
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mariamcgoretti I always said I would give it a bash but not feel guilty if it didnt work out -  postnatal period is tough
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mustntgrumble  @ Trisha _ the _ doc ha ha .  yes .  If I had thought like that I would have ended up feeling really disappointed . 
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 hey Nat ,  how are you ?  How many weeks left ?  Enjoy this time ! 
1	 @ StephanieBlease husband works 9 - 5 so can do pick up .  Impossible as a partner ,  I leave too late ! 
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 such an exciting time for you  :  )  once you stop work it will feel so real ! 
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 hope you have made some friends from it ?  If not deffo go to any local bumps  & amp ;  babies groups .  So good to have new mummy friends
1	 @ drgandalf52  @ paulinegrant1  @ StephanieBlease  @ andrew _ blease  @ hcwetherell A few minutes away and the convo has changed quite a bit
1	 @ Chihao who is it ? 
1	Latest issue of Medical Woman , the only magazine for female doctors in the UK :  
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 I feel better now than the whole time I was pregnant .  Much less tired .  Its quite bizarre .  You will be great x x
1	 @ StephanieBlease did you get your nannies through an agency ? 
1	 @ ClareHelm2  @ hcwetherell  @ GraceWetherell oh dear ,  thats a really short time !  try the OPI version .  For me its lasted the longest
1	 @ lpaice we were away for 40 mins last week -  left him with mother in law whilst we went to mothercare  ( rock n roll )  .  It was rather strange ! 
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ NikkiKF  @ asim137 the person who created Peppa must be a billionaire .  Its a worldwide phenomenon from what I can gather
1	 @ StephanieBlease but then ,  Im not at work .  Being back in a few months is going to be a whole new ball game .  .  .  !  Any  # tips4GPmums ? 
1	 @ hcwetherell Me too .  With a subtle glitter for Xmas .  Im on mat leave though . Personal view :  a shortish manicured red nail looks professional
1	 @ drunacoales thanks very much .  due date is next week  :  ) 
1	 @ DrMeirion I thought your article in @ MailOnline was ill - informed .  Please do actually read  # leanin  & amp ; also  .  .  .  
1	 @ aidenera thank you !  Its been on the back burner as I just had a baby .  New strategy  & amp ;  website planned for 2014 though .   # workinprogress
1	 @ NikkiKF  @ medicalwomenuk MWF may have some data / know exactly where to find it
1	 @ danielleofri just read your relevant article - so important for doctors to say these things !  Or burnout will increase .  When is your book out ? 
1	 @ docsuzy  @ pulsetoday maybe not anymore ,  but historically I suspect they will have done .  .  . how could Chand do 9 sessions  & amp ;  be GPC chair ? 
1	 @ hcwetherell  @ TheVoiceofTGG no ,  its a private group -  only members can see posts ;  and they cant see any of your other FB stuff  ( 1 ) 
1	 @ lpaice Im not surprised ,  its so expensive ,  so any little bit helps -  when I return to work my mum will do 1 day a week
1	 @ buletproofcardi  @ medicalwomenuk  @ EverydaySexism  @ TheBMA My favourite bit was quoting  @ sherylsandberg hoping to  " persuade "  women to  # leanin
1	 @ mustntgrumble  @ StephanieBlease  @ Trisha _ the _ doc agree ,  but some prefer denial . 
1	 @ hcwetherell  @ 246170  @ DrJohnCosgrove  @ drjohnbye  ( including my husband -  former Renal reg ,  now working in the private sector ) 
1	 @ WestHertsNHS  @ SteveLBP  @ SamanthaJNHS postnatal care is a problem in many hospitals - we opted for the knutsford suite 4 weeks ago -   # amazing
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mariamcgoretti Some of my friends felt guilty for switching to formula -  mainly due to comments from health pros  # unfair
1	 @ NikkiKF  @ DrFarahJameel nope ,  officially overdue .  In my 5th week of mat leave now !  Desperately hope I avoid IOL .  .  . 
1	 @ mgtmccartney  @ StuSutton sound advice - given by many @ my baby shower .  Works on days my baby sleeps .  Often he doesnt !   # chipofftheoldblock
1	 @ StuSutton  @ GrahamScambler also my fave !   # memories  # SociologyAsAppliedTo Medicine
1	 @ NikkiKF Im good -  Z slept for 7 hours last night ,  woop !  Would be lovely to catch up in the NY  :  )  xx
1	 @ DrKristinaKing  @ drlfarrell  @ mgtmccartney  @ PeteDeveson  @ medicalwomenuk what about professional courtesy ,  respect for colleagues .  .  . etc .  .  . 
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ hcwetherell  @ kaybee1978  @ Cleverestcookie looking lovely ! 
1	Dame Fiona Caldicott :  " Can Women Change the Culture of the NHS ?  "  in  @ GdnHealthcare 
1	 @ buletproofcardi  @ DrFarahJameel  @ medicalwomenuk  @ MailOnline great idea . We can ask him to advise us how we  & amp ; our part time peers can  # leanin
1	 @ bedshertslmcs can you post the link or email to me ?  Would love to read  @ drpete34s response
1	 @ asim137 not in Herts -  takes weeks .  Not ideal if feeding affected !  Referral was done and 8 weeks later no news  # NHSpostcodelottery
1	 @ hcwetherell Search for  " Tikos GP group "  on FB  & amp ; request to join . I think I can then add you - recent changes to process - correct ?  @ TheVoiceofTGG
1	 @ amcunningham love the diagram .  Any chance we can publish it in the next issue of Medical Woman ?   @ medicalwomenuk  # MW14
1	 @ WelshGasDoc depends on the deal -  some are amazing .  Wowcher  & amp ;  KGB also good .  Beauty / hair deals often really good  ( eg manicures !  ) 
1	Frightening article from the NEJM .  " Nearly 45 , 000 American adults die each year because they have no medical coverage "  
1	 @ GOBLONDE _ B  @ mencap _ charity great to hear about the existence of Sibs -  dont think it existed when I was younger  ( sister of someone with LD ) 
1	 @ SalmaAslam1 sorry for late reply -  Ive just had a baby
1	 @ drraggarwal  @ mgtmccartney  @ DrKristinaKing  @ drlfarrell  @ PeteDeveson  @ medicalwomenuk of course . But so is GP - Im in my surgery now 9 wks pp
1	 @ StuSutton well done for donating bone marrow to @ AnthonyNolan .   # inspiring  # inawe
1	 @ mattilg good on you for med regging -  still in Sydney ?  Im in contact with Philippa levy still -  saw her when she was travelling in London
1	 @ lpaice  " granny days "  -  love it !  So cute ,  will have to adopt that term too  :  ) 
1	 @ drgandalf52 did you know about it pre baby ? thanx to the kellymom blog - or Id have given up ! I thought I had a supply problem !  # clusterfeeding
1	 @ mgtmccartney  @ StuSutton  @ StephanieBlease thanks !  Im the proud mother of 8 week old Zach who is wonderful !   # shameaboutthesleepdeprivation
1	 @ buletproofcardi  @ TheBMA how can one be a good doctor if dehydrated and starving ?   # stressprevention
1	 @ hcwetherell  @ StephanieBlease oh no ,  whats happened .  .  . CQC turned up  & amp ;  went ballistic ? 
1	 @ StuSutton  @ GrahamScambler I think its the only recommended textbook I read cover to cover in my first year .  .  .  !   # shhhh  # donttellanyone
1	 @ drpete34 just read it -  thanks and such quick work !  Im off to Sussex for a spa break .  Baby car seat with us  # justincase
1	 @ jamie _ wallis sorry to hear that -  yes sleep always goes first .  And sleep deprivation is like torture 😩
1	 @ mustntgrumble  @ StephanieBlease  @ Trisha _ the _ doc FB is boring now .  Im back on twitter after a break as it makes 4am feeds way better ! 
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mariamcgoretti Was well worth the money -  meant husband could stay overnight and help me .  Midwives were amazing . 
1	 @ clarercgp  @ StephanieBlease x1 has been off sick throughout her 3rd pregnancy -  Paeds trainee -  I doubt she will return . 
1	 @ DrFarahJameel nothing Im afraid !  So bored .  .  . going shopping later to alleviate this  ;  -  ) 
1	 @ mattilg thanks !  give phil a big hug from me .  .  . sent her an FB last night .  Look forward to seeing your tweets  :  ) 
1	 @ SalmaAslam1 yes -  what email address did you use ?   @ medicalwomenuk
1	 @ asim137  @ StephanieBlease I find it so annoying ,  hoping by the time Zach is old enough ,  something else will be around
1	 @ kateahr  @ StephanieBlease this blog explains cluster feeding well  ( its a fab website )  :   .  .  .  
1	 @ hcwetherell shellac manis are great ,  an essential for many GPs -  do you think CQC would object ?  Eeek . 
1	 @ asim137  @ StephanieBlease I cant believe there is a whole channel JUST showing peppa pig .  .  . our friends children come round  & amp ;  watch it
1	 @ pulsetoday thank you for this .  It was a nice treat at the start of maternity leave ,  although have to say I feel a bit embarrassed  :  ) 
1	 @ SteveKellGP Im a partner on 6months mat leave  & amp ; wonder how many of my patients saw the article
1	 @ clarercgp  @ StephanieBlease My medic friends are dropping like flies out of the NHS -  x1 has just switched to Pharma
1	 @ buletproofcardi  @ medicalwomenuk  @ EverydaySexism  @ TheBMA  @ sherylsandberg I think  " part - time "  is one of my most hated phrases . 
1	 @ SalmaAslam1 great  :  ) 
1	 @ NikkiKF  @ StephanieBlease  @ DocSophieEM  @ elinlowri  @ parthaskar  @ Danielf90 can I join pls ?   & amp ; publish it in Medical woman ?   @ medicalwomenuk
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mustntgrumble  @ Trisha _ the _ doc I have enough friends & amp ; only want new mum friends if theyre open / helpful about the challenges
1	 @ StephanieBlease honesty is important  :  )  Im just amazed that Ive done loads of O & amp ; G  & amp ;  Paeds , been a GP & gt ; 2 years yet had no idea about it
1	 @ asim137 thanks ! 
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 sure you will ,  I meet my NCT buddies every week ,   & amp ;  also friends with peeps from my lazy daisy and hypnobirthing courses . 
1	 @ StuSutton  @ GrahamScambler I think it would be good for me to read it again - extremely relevant to GP . Hope its still on the  @ icsmsu syllabus
1	 @ StuSutton  @ StephanieBlease as Steph said . Makes you feel exhausted  & amp ; you worry you have no milk . On the plus :  can help baby sleep well o / night
1	 @ SamanthaJNHS When healthcare professionals are busy , they forget simple things . As an anxious patient  # hellomynameis makes a big difference
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mustntgrumble  @ Trisha _ the _ doc I also was honest with my NCT group about intervention -  ironically I ended up with the most ! 
1	 @ SamanthaJNHS  @ WestHertsNHS Great to hear this . I saw a midwife in DAU last week who didnt introduce herself  :  (   # hellomynameis
1	 @ mariamcgoretti  @ StephanieBlease I think most are lucky if they get any advice at all about Bfing . suspect it varies according to postcode
1	 @ mustntgrumble  @ StephanieBlease  @ Trisha _ the _ doc gosh thats crazy .  Why put up a front !  Agh .  I have a  " good "  baby ,  and even he is tough !  ! 
1	 @ mustntgrumble  @ StephanieBlease  @ Trisha _ the _ doc some of my friends think twitter is a waste of time -  am always trying to explain the pros
1	 @ DrFarahJameel thanks so much !  And welcome to  @ medicalwomenuk !  Officially over due date now ,  trying to be patient .  .  . 
1	 @ StephanieBlease  @ mariamcgoretti Im fine ,  but I think I have a  " good "  baby ,  plus am probably used to less sleep than what I get now .  .  .  ! 
1	 @ drpete34  @ drpete34 fantastic .  Im on a long car journey  ( passenger seat )  and enjoying the tweets coming out of  # rcgpac
1	 @ StephanieBlease no ,  but things like  @ NC Tcharity ,  mindful mamma  ( hypnobirthing )  ,  lazy daisy classes and GP knowledge do help !   :  -  ) 
1	 @ mattilg Im mum to an 8 week old .  .  . he is a superstar  :  -  )  Taking him on a long haul flight in a month -  eeeek ! 
1	 @ ClareHelm2  @ hcwetherell I find normal mani with xtra top coat lasts just as long as gels .  Gels easier when baby comes along to nail salon ! 
1	 @ StephanieBlease I just wish someone had warned me about cluster feeding -  advice about breastfeeding could be much improved
1	 @ hcwetherell  @ jkaffash hilarious .   ( feel a bit sorry for anyone who may have bought something full price from there )  .  .  . 
1	 @ Chihao thanks for digging that out .  .  . I almost didnt recognise myself  # dodgyfringe
1	 @ asim137 she was amazing -  dealt with Zachs tongue tie and gave me b / feeding advice
1	The last 8 weeks have been an education in :  breastfeeding ,  reflux ,  colic ,  newborn rashes .  Becoming a mum is making me a better GP  :  ) 
1	 @ dannymcg sad to hear but Im with you . A good friend  ( GP )  has just accepted a job  @ GSK .  We all have  ( non NHS )  options  & amp ;  over 35years to work
1	 @ LexiMorgan26 yes ,  its the best thing ever ,  quite lucky though that Zach is a  " good "  baby so not sleep deprived .  Have you done NCT ? 
1	 @ NikkiKF Ive just emailed some of the MWF officers  ( they arent on twitter )  to give them a heads up re .  providing useful data . 
1	 @ mariamcgoretti  @ StephanieBlease never heard of it .  Thank ,  will have a read .  .  . 
1	 @ ClareHelm2 I have an 8 week old so not much of a choice for now 😳 Had a massage this morning though and he had cream tea with Daddy 😊
1	 @ buletproofcardi  @ TheBMA no wonder burnout is on the increase
1	 @ lpaice our 1st granny morning is Saturday -  despite being  # parttimeGP on  # matleave I need to go to my surgery , my baby is 9 weeks . 
1	 @ WomenintheCity  @ medicalwomenuk Great to see this ,  well done to Prof Regan !   # imperialmedics
