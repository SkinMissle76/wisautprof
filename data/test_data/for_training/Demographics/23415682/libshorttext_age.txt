-0.42	 @ MartinHatch  .  .  .  that sounded just like a standard SharePoint diagnosis .  .   " on - prem or cloud ?  any WSPs installed ?  " 
-0.42	 @ TashasEv awesome !  Progress feels great ! 
-0.42	 @ WahVa Me neither ,  finding more and more things MS stores  & amp ;  syncs ! 
-0.42	 @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247 Why do you think we dig consultancy ?   : P
-0.42	 @ WahVa I reckon the SSID and key is stored with my Microsoft account
-0.42	 @ richardosman Im guessing this is why :  
-0.42	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Also note ,  Im a new customer and have not yet received a bill ,  however Im not making monthly payments yet til I know . 
-0.42	 @ speedmonkeycouk Id say the first point depends on the road ,  sometimes the surface is shite on the edges ,  best to keep in middle
-0.42	 @ WahVa It probably caches everything about my MS account when I was back at home
-0.42	 @ d4vinder Which means its an hour into it on E4 HD  -  shame theres no HD on  + 1
-0.42	 @ WahVa Very much so ,  I wonder if the schema for whats stored locally is publishde anywhere
-0.42	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams Hehe ,  JS has its uses but some bits of it ,  you have to admit ,  are worryingly crap ,  like lack of namespacing ,  etc
-0.42	Ah shite ,  my first tweet of 2014 was a bloody retweet .  Hope youre proud ,   @ Potato _ jim

-0.42	 @ sahilmalik I still find fascinating that SQL best practices for SharePoint are NOT SQL best practices .  How long b4 SQL Server SP Edition ? 
-0.42	That  @ skype ringtone on the  @ xboxone advert really jars me ,  mentally Im scrambling for my headset when I hear it
-0.42	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch  @ HughAJWood But now I wish I found that first ,  thats a lot easier to read  : D
-0.42	Well ain that a surprise  ( genuinely )  ,  the Harry Potter books are not available on Kindle .  . 
-0.42	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Hey guys ,  how can I find out my tariff rates on the web based system ? 
-0.42	 @ fabianwilliams  @ ghurlman Can I span all three ?   ;  ) 
-0.42	 @ d4vinder I aint got Sky Movies package  : P But I think its on Netflix anyhow
-0.42	 @ WahVa So if I log onto another machine with my MS acc ,  it syncs everthing thats stored ,  not just whats needed
-0.42	 @ SharePoint  @ joeloleson Isolated as in targeted ,  or as in accidental ? 
-0.42	 @ WahVa  @ googlechrome Perhaps !  And to you !   ( Canary runs fine btw ) 
-0.42	 @ drspouse For work I couldnt care less ,  Im not paying for the ticket  ( the main reason for my question )  . 
-0.42	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams SPs commonality means a disparse tech team can have something concrete to interface against I guess
-0.42	 @ jmikewatson  @ joeloleson  @ iOnline247 True .  But to endure the tirade of failure before you get successful can take so much out of someone
-0.42	 @ ghurlman Thing is with this ,  it goes from just looking photorealistic to looking really nice to look at
-0.42	 @ stacyDraper Why thank you !  Same to you ! 
-0.42	 @ MartinHatch  @ MossLover Oh ,  and congrats  : P
-0.42	 @ ToddKlindt Thats what Im thinking .  Mightve taken my work laptop there last year

-0.42	 @ stacyDraper Definitely ,  thats the most exciting part over renting . 
-0.42	Finally .  .  .  I think I can feel the house warming up now .  .  .  back after 2 days away and it was 12C when we got in  & gt ;  .  & lt ; 
-0.42	I notice theres a  @ BBCNews bulletin straight after the Queens speech .  Must be the highlights .

-0.42	 @ resing  @ bathawes You mean when did he upgrade his blog to WP ?   ;  ) 
-0.42	RT  @ MartinHatch can someone explain why a MSFT shop where all devs are connected to the same network would choose GIT over TFS  ? 
-0.42	Stuffed .  Roast was successful .  Time for Toy Story 3 then dessert .  Probably some more wine ,  too . 
-0.42	 @ bjartnes Nøgne  ? 
-0.42	MY daily disappointment now consists of scanning TV channels ,  seeing  " Keeping Up .  .  .  "  then finding out its not  " Appearances " 
-0.42	 @ stacyDraper Up that early on a Saturday ? 
-0.42	 " Can you answer this ?  "  Can I piss .  Its Hogmanay and Im enjoying a bottle of Old Putney . 
-0.42	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Thanks ,  I can see all your available tariffs there but nothing on the web site that says what Im currently on . 
-0.42	Just had a  @ skype chat with sister - in - law on Skype via their  @ XBoxOne  -  the kinect is one VERY cool bit of kit
-0.42	 @ bjartnes Interesting !

-0.42	Oh hell yes !  Toy Story on  @ BBCOne HD .

-0.42	On this day in 1066 ,  William the Conqueror is crowned King of England
-0.42	 @ Alan365 Trying to decide if thats a failing on your part or not  ;  ) 
-0.42	Just came across ShareCoffee by  @ ThorstenHans  -

-0.42	 @ wictor Gotta prop up the pageviews somehow ! 
-0.42	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams plus ,  where you position people who architect a whole solution using multiple technolgies ? 
-0.42	Whats 2014 like ,  my Kiwi followers ?  Also ,  put Twitter away and enjoy the night . 
-0.42	ProTip :  Do not use the brummy or scouse accent in a TV advert if you want credibility . 
-0.42	 @ steperrin I would drive as close as possible ,  possibly Luton ,  to significantly reduce the fair
-0.42	 @ HughAJWood lol  : P

-0.42	 @ Soulsailor Central London yeah I can see ,  but Ill see how close I can drive there  ( Luton usually )  . 
-0.42	 @ MartinHatch  @ teknirvana Instead of one directory per branch ,  its a single directory ,  and you checkout to other branches within that dir . 
-0.42	Anyone reckon Capaldis  # DoctorWho is gonna be a bit like an older David Tennant ? 
-0.42	 @ BritishGasHelp Ive not heard anything for about two months ,  my current supplier is a tad frustrating to work with .

-0.42	 @ govindajeggy tell it .  Sitting here giggling in bed ,  thinking of different possibilities for that story
-0.42	Fuck me ,  youd think the world was coming to an end .  .  .  
-0.42	 @ SharePoint Understood  -  one last question ,  do you believe there may have been an overreaction to whats happened ? 
-0.42	Also ,  is there a law in the UK about being placed onto an energy tariff without asking you ?  Thats worse than mis - selling ,  surely ? 
-0.42	 @ wictor The ol blog wont visit itself now ,  will it ?   : P
-0.42	 @ pbjorklund  @ sebmatthews  @ HughAJWood I like these discussions ,  myself  : P

-0.42	 @ sympmarc  @ joeloleson You need to be able to mute irrelevant blog posts from being autotweeted
-0.42	 @ stacyDraper As much as SP is supposed to be a document management tool ,  its very shit at basic stuff like moving / copying docs
-0.42	 @ AskNationwide All sorted now ,  frustrating experience for a second time ,  however . 
-0.42	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams How about just kickass at software dev in general but not as hot at JavaScript which is kinda lame anyway
-0.42	RT  @ NYorksPolice Reports of black ice around Blubberhouses on the  # A59  -  take care !   & lt ;  Theres a village called Blubberhouses .  Awesome !

-0.42	 ( Potentially )  controversial viewpoint made :  
-0.42	 @ dvntownsend  " Dip indeed !  "  
-0.42	Genuine question :  who in the UK considers rail travel before anything else when going somewhere ? 
-0.42	Whos this chap rocking the stonewash ?  
-0.42	 @ Shieldsy6587 I thought you worked at that car sales place ? 
-0.42	 @ sympmarc 27 ?

-0.42	Hey ,   @ BBCOne  -  that advert for The Voice 2014 is some pretty freaky sh * t .  .  . 
-0.42	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch the branching system ,  and ease of cloning from github is why I like git
-0.42	FINALLY got round to watching Deathly Hallows Pt 2 .  Pretty good ,  best photography of the lot I think . 
-0.42	Chrome is taking about 15 seconds to start loading pages from new tabs .  .  .  anyone else seen this ?

-0.42	 @ joeloleson  @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247  " agility "  is the key word there .  Stand still and youre left behind .  Keep moving .  Keep learning . 
-0.42	If you have an image carousel that does a postback on previous / next then your carousel is shit .   My AdBlock counter loves it though . 
-0.42	 @ WahVa Nope ,  secured .  Double checked . 
-0.42	 @ iOnline247 Im sure they were a form of torture in the Cold War
