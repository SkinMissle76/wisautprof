3	 @ MartinHatch  . com or self hosted ?  got a plugin thats interfering ? 
3	 @ MartinHatch  .  .  .  that sounded just like a standard SharePoint diagnosis .  .   " on - prem or cloud ?  any WSPs installed ?  " 
3	 @ TashasEv awesome !  Progress feels great ! 
3	 @ WahVa Me neither ,  finding more and more things MS stores  & amp ;  syncs ! 
3	 @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247 Why do you think we dig consultancy ?   : P
3	 @ WahVa I reckon the SSID and key is stored with my Microsoft account
3	 @ richardosman Im guessing this is why :  
3	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Also note ,  Im a new customer and have not yet received a bill ,  however Im not making monthly payments yet til I know . 
3	 @ speedmonkeycouk Id say the first point depends on the road ,  sometimes the surface is shite on the edges ,  best to keep in middle
3	 @ WahVa It probably caches everything about my MS account when I was back at home
3	 @ d4vinder Which means its an hour into it on E4 HD  -  shame theres no HD on  + 1
3	 @ WahVa Very much so ,  I wonder if the schema for whats stored locally is publishde anywhere
3	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams Hehe ,  JS has its uses but some bits of it ,  you have to admit ,  are worryingly crap ,  like lack of namespacing ,  etc
3	Ah shite ,  my first tweet of 2014 was a bloody retweet .  Hope youre proud ,   @ Potato _ jim
3	Woop !  Half way .   ( Checked in at Scotch Corner Moto Services )  
3	 @ BritishGasHelp I understand if youve moved resource to handle calls for the storm .  I want to know how my switch to BG is going . 
3	 @ sahilmalik I still find fascinating that SQL best practices for SharePoint are NOT SQL best practices .  How long b4 SQL Server SP Edition ? 
3	That  @ skype ringtone on the  @ xboxone advert really jars me ,  mentally Im scrambling for my headset when I hear it
3	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch  @ HughAJWood But now I wish I found that first ,  thats a lot easier to read  : D
3	Well ain that a surprise  ( genuinely )  ,  the Harry Potter books are not available on Kindle .  . 
3	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Hey guys ,  how can I find out my tariff rates on the web based system ? 
3	 @ fabianwilliams  @ ghurlman Can I span all three ?   ;  ) 
3	 @ d4vinder I aint got Sky Movies package  : P But I think its on Netflix anyhow
3	 @ WahVa So if I log onto another machine with my MS acc ,  it syncs everthing thats stored ,  not just whats needed
3	 @ SharePoint  @ joeloleson Isolated as in targeted ,  or as in accidental ? 
3	 @ WahVa  @ googlechrome Perhaps !  And to you !   ( Canary runs fine btw ) 
3	 @ drspouse For work I couldnt care less ,  Im not paying for the ticket  ( the main reason for my question )  . 
3	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams SPs commonality means a disparse tech team can have something concrete to interface against I guess
3	 @ jmikewatson  @ joeloleson  @ iOnline247 True .  But to endure the tirade of failure before you get successful can take so much out of someone
3	 @ ghurlman Thing is with this ,  it goes from just looking photorealistic to looking really nice to look at
3	 @ stacyDraper Why thank you !  Same to you ! 
3	 @ MartinHatch  @ MossLover Oh ,  and congrats  : P
3	 @ ToddKlindt Thats what Im thinking .  Mightve taken my work laptop there last year
3	If you switch channel to a movie ,  and it immediately cuts to adverts ,  take the hint :  its probably not that great a movie
3	Want some nostalgia ?  Crank up this 18 second beaut :  
3	 @ stacyDraper It is .  Pure C +  +  .  All you can get out of it are the DllExports
3	 @ stacyDraper Definitely ,  thats the most exciting part over renting . 
3	Finally .  .  .  I think I can feel the house warming up now .  .  .  back after 2 days away and it was 12C when we got in  & gt ;  .  & lt ; 
3	I notice theres a  @ BBCNews bulletin straight after the Queens speech .  Must be the highlights . 
3	 @ fabianwilliams Is that a Toyota ?   ( recognise the players UI ) 
3	 @ resing  @ bathawes You mean when did he upgrade his blog to WP ?   ;  ) 
3	RT  @ MartinHatch can someone explain why a MSFT shop where all devs are connected to the same network would choose GIT over TFS  ? 
3	Stuffed .  Roast was successful .  Time for Toy Story 3 then dessert .  Probably some more wine ,  too . 
3	 @ bjartnes Nøgne  ? 
3	MY daily disappointment now consists of scanning TV channels ,  seeing  " Keeping Up .  .  .  "  then finding out its not  " Appearances " 
3	 @ stacyDraper Up that early on a Saturday ? 
3	 " Can you answer this ?  "  Can I piss .  Its Hogmanay and Im enjoying a bottle of Old Putney . 
3	 @ SP _ EnergyPeople Thanks ,  I can see all your available tariffs there but nothing on the web site that says what Im currently on . 
3	Just had a  @ skype chat with sister - in - law on Skype via their  @ XBoxOne  -  the kinect is one VERY cool bit of kit
3	 @ bjartnes Interesting ! 
3	 @ welbymcroberts  @ AskNationwide Cancelled .  A new card was issued and sent to the old house address .  We were not informed . 
3	Oh hell yes !  Toy Story on  @ BBCOne HD . 
3	 @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247 Its not world domination money ,  but it pays the bills . 
3	On this day in 1066 ,  William the Conqueror is crowned King of England
3	 @ Alan365 Trying to decide if thats a failing on your part or not  ;  ) 
3	Just came across ShareCoffee by  @ ThorstenHans  -  
3	Upgrading laptop to Win8 . 1 .  .  .  Taking ages .  1 hour already .  .  . 
3	So yeah ,  theres this dude in charge of Ethics in Uganda .  .  .  
3	 @ wictor Gotta prop up the pageviews somehow ! 
3	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams plus ,  where you position people who architect a whole solution using multiple technolgies ? 
3	Whats 2014 like ,  my Kiwi followers ?  Also ,  put Twitter away and enjoy the night . 
3	ProTip :  Do not use the brummy or scouse accent in a TV advert if you want credibility . 
3	 @ steperrin I would drive as close as possible ,  possibly Luton ,  to significantly reduce the fair
3	 @ HughAJWood lol  : P
3	 @ speedmonkeycouk  ( until you meet someone or someone wants to overtake ) 
3	Tonights tipple  @ whiskycraig 
3	 @ SonicBoomSix I know right !  Found it when clearing out stuff from my parents .  I remember that gig well ! 
3	 @ Soulsailor Central London yeah I can see ,  but Ill see how close I can drive there  ( Luton usually )  . 
3	 @ MartinHatch  @ teknirvana Instead of one directory per branch ,  its a single directory ,  and you checkout to other branches within that dir . 
3	Anyone reckon Capaldis  # DoctorWho is gonna be a bit like an older David Tennant ? 
3	 @ BritishGasHelp Ive not heard anything for about two months ,  my current supplier is a tad frustrating to work with . 
3	Merry Christmas to those celebrating !   : D A day of food n booze awaits ! 
3	Gleðilegt nýtt ár !   # iceland
3	A blast from the past !   @ SonicBoomSix 
3	 @ MR _ ICT Yup ,  finding mroe and more things it stores  & amp ;  syncs ! 
3	 @ MartinHatch  @ teknirvana A directory is a workspace ,  and represents a single branch at any one time . 
3	
3	Didnt know the TC Helicon Voice One had a setting for blocked nose  # hootenanny
3	 @ jmikewatson Christ ,  I was that were the case  : P
3	 @ d4vinder Oh , its just started on E4 + 1
3	Goodbye ,  SharePoint Community .  It was Nice Knowing You .  
3	 @ bjartnes Hehe ,  Ill check it out !  And the beer  : P
3	 @ govindajeggy tell it .  Sitting here giggling in bed ,  thinking of different possibilities for that story
3	Fuck me ,  youd think the world was coming to an end .  .  .  
3	 @ SharePoint Understood  -  one last question ,  do you believe there may have been an overreaction to whats happened ? 
3	Also ,  is there a law in the UK about being placed onto an energy tariff without asking you ?  Thats worse than mis - selling ,  surely ? 
3	 @ wictor The ol blog wont visit itself now ,  will it ?   : P
3	 @ pbjorklund  @ sebmatthews  @ HughAJWood I like these discussions ,  myself  : P
3	It seems  @ AskNationwide have a habit of cancelling your card for small online payments ,  even for frequent payments
3	10 minutes on hold to  @ BritishGas to enquire about my switch .  No answer .  Given up .  Why am I switching to them again ? 
3	 @ stacyDraper I know of those ,  havent had a good look around them yet though
3	 @ WahVa  @ google  @ googlechrome agreed  -  on build 31 . 0 . 1650 . 63 m  -  downloading Canary now to see if its there too

3	 @ stacyDraper  @ bkkbase Had no probs with first gen Surface RT .  Expensive Netflix machine ,  but built well .  Sturdy . 
3	 @ LoungeFlyZ  @ furuknap Good point ,  wonder if its a one - shot thing thats blown out of proportion
3	 @ iOnline247 I reckon someone could successfully freelance quite well just building regexes for people
3	 @ JoyKnows  @ furuknap  @ joeloleson VoldePoint ? 
3	Eat .  Sleep .  Code .  Repeat . 
3	 @ pbjorklund  @ sebmatthews  @ HughAJWood Personally ,  Id use git ,  but I would like to hear someones justification
3	 @ stacyDraper Fairly well so far .  Still got largely bare ,  magnolia walls everwhere .  Some decorating to be done in Spring . 
3	 @ drspouse Noes !  Roast beef in this household ,  horseradish on standby
3	Meat :  resting .  Spuds :  roasting .  Pigs n Blankets :  nearly forgotten about .   # CrisisAverted
3	If you google for  "  & lt ; album name & gt ;  playlist "  you get the track list of that album .  Click on the titles ,  it will give you a YouTube vid . 
3	 @ Potato _ jim Bruce is done by Barry Humphries  /  Dame Edna Everidge
3	 @ sympmarc  @ joeloleson You need to be able to mute irrelevant blog posts from being autotweeted
3	 @ stacyDraper As much as SP is supposed to be a document management tool ,  its very shit at basic stuff like moving / copying docs
3	 @ AskNationwide All sorted now ,  frustrating experience for a second time ,  however . 
3	 @ ghurlman  @ fabianwilliams How about just kickass at software dev in general but not as hot at JavaScript which is kinda lame anyway
3	RT  @ NYorksPolice Reports of black ice around Blubberhouses on the  # A59  -  take care !   & lt ;  Theres a village called Blubberhouses .  Awesome ! 
3	Wow ,  the  @ BBCOne trailer for Toy Story 3 immediately after Toy Story  ( 1 )  .  .  .  really saw how far the animation tech has come ! 
3	Synopsis of  # Sherlock :   .  .  .  mortal danger stalks the reception .  .  .  ,  you have 35 minutes to develop and conclude a story .  Get to it . 
3	 @ Potato _ jim Its taken about 3 hours for our house to get up to comfy temperature .  Wear slippers  or two pairs of socks . 
3	Well thats Finding Nemo screwed .  The voice actor of Marlin does Hank Scorpio from the Simpsons .  Cannot Unhear . 
3	RT  @ MartinHatch  @ jimmywim Toothpaste is also awesome at removing sticky labels from mirrors !   @ thecavegirl  & lt ;  Wish I knew that a few weeks ago
3	
3	 @ sympmarc  @ ciphertxt Im actually curious to how much network bandwidth and latency is wasted due to these
3	Wonder if I should put up a sail on the car .  .  might save a few bob on fuel on the way home
3	 @ ghurlman The 2009 animated  " A Christmas Carol "  is on now ,  even this looks like years ahead
3	And the finale for the London Fireworks   -   " The Oban " 
3	 ( Potentially )  controversial viewpoint made :  
3	 @ dvntownsend  " Dip indeed !  "  
3	Genuine question :  who in the UK considers rail travel before anything else when going somewhere ? 
3	Whos this chap rocking the stonewash ?  
3	 @ Shieldsy6587 I thought you worked at that car sales place ? 
3	 @ sympmarc 27 ? 
3	 @ WahVa My laptop is ,  well its using my Microsoft account . 
3	 @ ejaya2 also remember the reason for the season…al lag ,  just that it happens all over the globe
3	So is this the Captains Table of  # SPC14 ?  
3	ProTip :  Do NOT go with  @ AskNationwide for your retail banking .  Most confusing experience there is on the market . 
3	 @ ghurlman Ratatouille was the same . 
3	 @ garrytrinder Meadowhell ?  At this time ? 
3	 @ eddiewouldgo86  @ SonicBoomSix I cant get the bit from P - Rock out my head ,  I think it was  " On the Ceiling "  or  " Scones " 
3	
3	 @ MartinHatch  @ MossLover New - Object .  .  .   : P
3	 @ jmikewatson Its the Daily Mail ,  its sensationalism personified .  Bit like Fox .

3	 @ stacyDraper Sometimes the engineering of parts of it interest me ,  like Id love to see the source of owssvr . dll
3	 @ katrinderPR you too !  All the best to yourself ,   @ garrytrinder and  @ PaoloDiDoggio  ! 
3	Hey ,   @ BBCOne  -  that advert for The Voice 2014 is some pretty freaky sh * t .  .  . 
3	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch the branching system ,  and ease of cloning from github is why I like git
3	FINALLY got round to watching Deathly Hallows Pt 2 .  Pretty good ,  best photography of the lot I think . 
3	Chrome is taking about 15 seconds to start loading pages from new tabs .  .  .  anyone else seen this ? 
3	 @ welbymcroberts agreed ,  first one was on the other night
3	Awesome !   # Lego 
3	 @ thecavegirl Toothpaste works wonders cleaning up dye from skin  # dontask
3	 @ stacyDraper JavaScript based list item mover would be neat
3	 @ MartinHatch  @ HughAJWood  @ teknirvana That is a huge problem .  There are resources out there ,  but youre generally on your own to find the
3	 @ furuknap  @ LoungeFlyZ Ive always felt hesitant about having a SharePoint *  brand myself .  .  .  hence I went with Omicron Llama
3	 @ welbymcroberts  @ AskNationwide New address was updated as correspondence address yet nothing was sent here . 
3	Watching  @ daraobriain s Craic Dealer on BBC2 .  .  .  how does his mind work ?  Hilarious ! 
3	 @ joeloleson  @ jmikewatson  @ iOnline247  " agility "  is the key word there .  Stand still and youre left behind .  Keep moving .  Keep learning . 
3	If you have an image carousel that does a postback on previous / next then your carousel is shit .   My AdBlock counter loves it though . 
3	 @ WahVa Nope ,  secured .  Double checked . 
3	 @ iOnline247 Im sure they were a form of torture in the Cold War
3	Fair few fireworks being set off in Reykjavik now !  
3	 @ teknirvana  @ MartinHatch  @ HughAJWood Pro Git taught me everything I know  -  
3	How do I SharePoint again ? 
3	I really want to see a how they did it for the London fireworks ,  you cant see any of the fireworks batteries at all on the Eye
3	At my parents house ,  Win8 . 1 on my laptop ,  connects to WiFI .  Have never been here with this laptop before  # Witchcraft
3	 @ steviegell Yup .  The only jobs theyre taking are those which the lazy are too proud and lacking in humility ,  and complain theres no work
3	 @ garrytrinder Meadowhell does have a car park the size of Texas though
