6	well ,  that sure was some disappointing takeaway .  remind me to actually go food shopping before the shops close next Sunday . 
6	 " Morangate "  Round Up Post  -  This is an attempt to condense the last couple of days of drama into one post .  .  .  .

6	writing a review of Homeland  (  @ doctorow )  and typed  " kidnapped by BHS "   (  @ BHS _ UK )  instead of  " DHS "   -  that would be quite a different story .  .  .
