3	 @ AdamFaz81 I think Kidd and possibly Billy King will go by the all - star game .  Possibly a big trade too .  D - Will or Lopez .

3	 @ therealmarkj Sounds like youre having a good xmas !

3	Still no AK - 47 in todays  @ BrooklynNets line - up  :  -  ( 
3	Thats all they need ‚Äú @ NYDNInterNets :  Nets announce that Paul Pierce is out 2 - 4 weeks with a fracture in his shooting hand‚Äù

3	 @ robinince do you prefer Bob ? 
3	 # NBABallot Stephen Curry
3	Still dont like these ‚Äú @ NetsDaily :  Get ready for the Christmas jersey .  
3	As if being down 66 - 42 wasnt bad enough ,  Paul Pierce got himself ejected with a flagrant foul 2 on George Hill : 
3	 @ AdamFaz81 Or just to wind up Knicks fans .  Or because Mikhail Prokhorov has more money than sense .  Pick any daft reason you like . 
3	 @ AdamFaz81 theres a fair chance .  I think one of the key players ,  Williams or Lopez ,  will be traded by Feb .  They need to make a statement
3	 @ theleroy Im only watching as Ann Marie has promised me Gemma Merner in a bikini . 
3	Getting really desperate now MT :  ‚Äú @ andy _ vasquez :  Jason Kidd says he will NOT wear a tie tomorrow .  Nets are 2 - 0 when he goes tieless . ‚Äù

3	Its a bit chilly for that !  
3	 @ therealmarkj Theyre the midday tip - off against the Bulls .  When they planned the schedule both teams looked like contenders ,  not any more ! 
3	 @ theleroy  @ therealmarkj Is my twitter app acting up or has Swanny done a runner ? 
3	Will the  @ BrooklynNets make a play for Omer Asik now ?
