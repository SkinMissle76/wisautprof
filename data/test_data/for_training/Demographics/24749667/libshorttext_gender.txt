-1	As if being down 66 - 42 wasnt bad enough ,  Paul Pierce got himself ejected with a flagrant foul 2 on George Hill : 
-1	 @ AdamFaz81 Or just to wind up Knicks fans .  Or because Mikhail Prokhorov has more money than sense .  Pick any daft reason you like . 
-1	 @ AdamFaz81 theres a fair chance .  I think one of the key players ,  Williams or Lopez ,  will be traded by Feb .  They need to make a statement
-1	 @ theleroy Im only watching as Ann Marie has promised me Gemma Merner in a bikini . 
-1	Getting really desperate now MT :  ‚Äú @ andy _ vasquez :  Jason Kidd says he will NOT wear a tie tomorrow .  Nets are 2 - 0 when he goes tieless . ‚Äù
