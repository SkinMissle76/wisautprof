-0.42	Considering my angry face en route to work this morning ,  today’s not working out too shabby 😊
-0.42	Here’s a random thing .  Got a  # groupon voucher ,  2 nights in  # liverpool ,  plus one dinner and one breakfast  # forsale .  Cost £110 .  Any offers ? 
-0.42	Confession :  I am marginally obsessed with Danny Dyer .   I can’t help skipping into the accent… .  😍  # eastenders
-0.42	Lookin forward to a lovely day hangin’ with Pappa Coops for some DIY action .  I think the DIY canvases his desire to pop round for a gossip . 
-0.42	Aaaah ,  Monday Club with the family tonight .  Deeliiish dinner and gossips .  Minus Christmas decs though ,  badtimes !  😞
-0.42	8am start tomorrow as we cruise up to  # halifax for  # worktimes .  Does that classify as proper ‘in the north ? ’ Prepping accent in anticipation . 
-0.42	Coming home after a  few wines ,  faced with the duty of finishing writing a feature is either a stroke of genius or absolute disaster… . 
-0.42	So ,  was there like mega rain and wind last night or did I just imagine it ?  Utterly crap nights sleep  :  ( 
-0.42	These have taken me a little by surprise today .  Whoever thought of filling pretzels with pillows of…

-0.42	Just seen an email entitled ‘Walking in a onesie wonderland’ .  Genuinely gutted I didn’t come up with that one…
-0.42	Theres a girl sitting here as Im about to have dinner sitting here in flip flops .  In actual November .  As sparkly as they are ,  I’m outraged .

-0.42	 @ Mandmegmc I actually love this ! 
-0.42	I have decided I very much need to go to Lapland .  Are children and  /  or smug happy other half a absolute requirement ? 
-0.42	I LOVE a little bit of MK twinkle at Christmas !   # shopping  # exciting  @  thecentre : mk 
-0.42	Weekend has gone too damn fast .  I have naff all too contribute to those ‘how was your weekend’ convos that will happen at 9am  :  (

-0.42	My cat had been living here for nine months and still every morning ,  likes to purr and jump around on me until I wake up .  Cute habit 😽
-0.42	Getting increasingly nervous for my first day tomorrow .  Exciting ,  but very scary !   # newjob  # freshstart
-0.42	So I cycled to  @ ww _ uk this morning in a desperate attempt to offset the cake and yummies I ate this week .  Fail ,  1lb on . 
-0.42	Restaurant reviewing tonight with Pappa Coops .  A nice little way to say thank you for his DIY efforts these past few weeks  :  ) 
-0.42	 @ CostaCoffee haha !  I was bowled over regardless ,  I’m sure your arrival would have been icing on the cake !  ☺️
-0.42	Tonight I am hanging out with one of my girls .  Sad fact is ,  she’s educating me in taxes and doing my own accounts .  I am not vorderman .   # eek

-0.42	This week has whizzed fast .  Beyond whizzed ,  actually .  Genuinely am bemused it’s the weekend already ! 
-0.42	People who park outside your flat and have a loud as you like phone call thorough their car speaker system .  Seriously ?  ! 
-0.42	I’ve seen at least three people eating before they pay round the supermarket this morning .  Since when was this acceptable ? 
-0.42	 @ missacbrooks but it’s genuine frozen water ?  !  I’m so confused !  Ice cube trays at my gaffe at the one !
