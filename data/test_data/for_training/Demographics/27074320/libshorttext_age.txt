-0.56	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer Theres lots of debate about the line between art and porn in films and photography .  I dont trust a gov / ISP to decide . 
-0.56	Surely in a side - by - side comparison ,  you should put them the same way around ? 
-0.56	This Christmas is the year of Snapchat .

-0.56	 @ charlottelowey  @  _ raychul  @ Rossaluss Seeing how sleep and walking compares for tech / producer vs judge vs punter would be interesting ! 
-0.56	 @ DavidPuckridge Whereas RTD had opposite problem :  great at managing wider picture but bad at the eps .  We need a new head writer .   # heresy
-0.56	 @  _ raychul  " I was pleased to note yesterday that Michael Gove was also wearing one .  "  Fuck fuck fuck

-0.56	 @ DavidPuckridge Also ,  I dont expect to love it all ,  but equally I dont expect to actively dislike it as much as I have lately . 
-0.56	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer It also makes me angry that theyre telling ISPs to protect the children when parents should be doing that . 
-0.56	OH GOD 
-0.56	 @ mzlondon Maybe Ill avoid the drama that I had last year with ARGComFest clashing with a Murray final .  .  .

-0.56	 @ Coopleton Its good though .  It makes everyone feel like were just hanging out .   # callback
-0.56	 @ Bodminzer I dont think that liberals are pro - porn ,  as much as they are just anti - censorship  /  anti - internet filtering . 
-0.56	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer Lots of non - adult sites blocked .  One big example being A Softer World coming up as  " adult content "  .
