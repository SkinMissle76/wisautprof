3	 @ Lizzlie  @ QueenoftheBerri School Night is over at the courtyard ! 
3	 @ livi27 When are you up in Edinburgh ? 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge  ( No one could lie .  First person they met asked his name ,  he didnt tell them .  ) 
3	 @ Coopleton Its a bit niche to be honest…
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer By providing a  " safe "  internet ,  theyre perpetuating a myth that the internet CAN be safe for children . 
3	 @ howlieT  @ maxandivan Keep trying .  Not showing as sold out so the tickets are / were just in baskets . 
3	 @ CJTerry Im still disappointed that this wasnt true :  
3	 @  _ raychul 
3	 @ sven945 So we did .  Hello ! 
3	 @ zoefell It was actually a timer .   :  ( 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge  ( How DID the TARDIS get through the tech shield that blocked everything else ?  ) 
3	 @ yianni _ a Unfortunately it clashes with another show that Im doing !  Sorry…
3	 @ Pappystweet Signs that  # badults are good :   @  _ raychul and I awake at 3am discussing our favourite lines . 
3	 @ LimitedThorns Not in Edinburgh anymore ,  otherwise I would offer to deliver pizza…
3	Judging from  @ charlotteloweys photo on the  @ ComedyAwards website ,  my arm is on the panel this year .  
3	No one showed up to my party .   :  (  
3	 @  _ raychul Hooray ,  you found the present that I intentionally left for you ! 
3	 @ Pappystweet Mate ,  sort it out :  
3	 @ matthewcrosby MATE !  Seen this ?  
3	 @ h2osarah zzz…
3	This charger is perfectly safe to use ,  right ?  
3	 @ stecks Every Nexus that Ive used has been the best phone that I have ever used .  The 4 is beautiful and I look forward to its successor ! 
3	 @ stephen _ abbott Hi Stephen ,  aware of that but still alarming !  Prefer needless worrying to letting something like that slip past .  .  .   ;  ) 
3	Good news everyone !  
3	 .  @ SareyGamp As an aspiring screenwriter ,  you should probably read this :  
3	 @ DavidPuckridge All true .  RTD was way more consistent than Moffat though . 
3	 @ ivanogo  @ matthewcrosby Well ?  What was it ?  SHARE . 
3	 @ cioj We were both ready to party ! 
3	Slight overkill to use QLab… 
3	 @ mya _ moo You are rude . 
3	 @ puzzlemuteson Really enjoyed your set at  # atpiceland !  Strange question :  are you currently in Kaffibarinn in Reykjavik ? 
3	Behind the scenes at the  @ ComedyAwards  -  watching  @ stevechortle update Chortle live ! 
3	The most brilliant stupid game ,  Surgeon Simulator 2013 ,  is on sale for just £2 . 37 .  BUY IT !  
3	 @ maxandivan Has  @ tomosp been scrawling on your posters ? 
3	 @ bechillcomedian  @ sarahbennetto Cafe Royal ,  Newcastle ? 
3	Camerons moral posturing over porn is made all the more hypocritical by his refusal to back  # NoMorePage3 and his CEOP budget cuts last year
3	 @ mzlondon  @  _ raychul Like last year ,  I did the technical design for Max and Ivan ! 
3	Whoever is responsible for editing the Google Nexus webpage is an idiot .  
3	 @ stephen _ abbott Also apols for the bill / act mistake :  took name from bottom of the bill which obviously refers to the new name should it pass
3	Post - Fringe tradition watching Peacock Season :   " Why bother coming to Edinburgh at all if its so dreadful ?  "   " Ha !  Youll know when you leave " 
3	Cameron doesnt care about the Dept .  for Education consultation showing 63 %  of parents oppose a default - on filtering system . 
3	Exciting stuff ,  huh guys ?  !   @ ComedyAwards 
3	 @ BdayGirlsComedy Very blurry but is this yours ?  X 
3	 @ RockstarSupport  @ Steam _ Support I opted into the Steam Beta updates and received an update that claimed to fix Mac problems  -  but it didnt…
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer Also worth noting that mobile phones have had an adult content filter for years and Ive had major problems with it . 
3	 @ stephen _ abbott  ( even if it is par for the course with Philip Hollobone ) 
3	 @ tombellforever I learn something new every day !  
3	 @  _ Ben _ Walker Got back yesterday and am working through admin !  Will reply later tonight . 
3	 @ howlieT  @  _ raychul  @ QueenoftheBerri It shouldnt even be a debate is the mad thing !  Non - students should just accept that its their bill . 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge Oh ,  and I didnt dislike todays episode because it was edgy or unfamiliar or a diff approach .  It was just shoddy writing . 
3	 @ mzlondon  @ charlottelowey Shes already considering the 13 show challenge .  .  . 
3	 .  @ matthewcrosby doing his bit on  @ joshwiddicombes show .  Nothing says showbiz like a petrol station near Scunthorpe .  
3	Bit of a weird thing to see on the side in  @ maxandivans bathroom .  .  .  
3	Anyone got a spare ticket to Hot Dub Time Machine tonight in Edinburgh ? 
3	 @ edfringe Surprised ? 
3	 @ charlottelowey  @  _ raychul  @ Rossaluss I keep thinking that you and dad should get them just for interesting comparison…
3	 @ mizbung They all sound like brilliant things to do !  How long are you out there for ? 
3	 @ BenPappyClark  @ johnnyechoecho You should upload that song from the car journey yesterday ! 
3	The next idiot I see tweet about  " canned laughter "  in a studio sitcom will get a free ticket to a sitcom recording to help them understand . 
3	 @ Bodminzer I hope that youre not making fun of my dance party .   & gt ;  :  ( 
3	 # edfringe 2013 is officially over :  the cow is heading back to London !   @ followthecow 
3	Dear Russell T .  Davies :  please come back ,  all is forgiven .  I am prepared to forget about Voyage of the Damned .  Love ,  James . 
3	 @  _ raychul Wrong :  then Ill be playing all of the games ! 
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer Incredibly tricky to have a meaningful conversation / debate about the finer points of an issue in 140 characters or less
3	 @ brucedes The two tickets links in that article are broken ! 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge That too . 
3	 " They look like rutting bison ,  in a mad way .  But bison with racquets .  "   -  actual tennis commentary from the BBC . 
3	 # Latitude update :  bad reaction to insect bite yesterday .  Hand has doubled in size .  Prescribed antibiotics  & amp ;  antihistamines .   # LatitudeMoment
3	 @ ivanogo  @ matthewcrosby 5  # TeaCount
3	 @  _ raychul fuuuuuuuuuuuu -  
3	 @ sarahbennetto  @ bechillcomedian  ( Urban Cafe in Dance City ,  I mean ) 
3	Last day of  # edfringe but finally found  @ ThePleasances new venues !  
3	 @ Coopleton Tweeting the perfect mix of comedy in - jokes and outrage at politics .  I think . 
3	Well I clearly havent updated this part of my calendar for over a month… 
3	 @ TimandraHarknes Sounds like your sort of thing :  
3	 @ h2osarah Also ,  I have a blind now !  And a mirror !  This is exciting stuff ! 
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer Theres lots of debate about the line between art and porn in films and photography .  I dont trust a gov / ISP to decide . 
3	Surely in a side - by - side comparison ,  you should put them the same way around ? 
3	This Christmas is the year of Snapchat . 
3	Glad you liked it !  Thanks again RT  @ LimitedThorns :  Special delivery from  @ JamesLowey and  # SchoolNight LEGENDSSSSS  :  )  
3	 @ Rossaluss Hooray !  
3	 @ ivanogo Hooray !   @  _ raychul and I got to Level 6 and completed  " You Cant Do Geography Under Pressure "  !  Bet you cant .  
3	 @ DavidPuckridge Definitely .  I agree with all of that !  Capaldi will be fantastic . 
3	 @ QueenoftheBerri  ( but mostly me ) 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge  ( Later he told someone that he had a plan ,  then immediately confessed that he didnt .  ) 
3	 @ Schrokit It is pretty sad .   :  ( 
3	 @ stecks Are there still trains running to Manchester ? 
3	Just wandered into Urban Outfitters .  80 %  of their mens t - shirts were just the word OBEY in different styles .  Irony does not exist anymore . 
3	 @ howlieT  + 1 to everything  @  _ raychul  & amp ;   @ QueenoftheBerri said .  Ive lived in a house with 2 students  & amp ;  2 non - students .  Only non - students pay . 
3	 @ charlottelowey  @  _ raychul  @ Rossaluss Seeing how sleep and walking compares for tech / producer vs judge vs punter would be interesting ! 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge Whereas RTD had opposite problem :  great at managing wider picture but bad at the eps .  We need a new head writer .   # heresy
3	 @  _ raychul  " I was pleased to note yesterday that Michael Gove was also wearing one .  "  Fuck fuck fuck
3	 @ Pappystweet I didnt do the schedules !  !  ! 
3	 @ Rossaluss sigh James is trying his best at that game again 
3	Proposal :   # Latitude should be renamed  " Kitsonfest "  .   # biting  # satire
3	Part two of the LinkedIn sent invitations to almost everyone that I have ever emailed saga .  
3	 @ jameswalkerguy Yes ,  Im free precisely then ! 
3	 @ TheNickHelm Good reference to your show in this article :  
3	Also ,   @ BetaMaleJH appears to have a brief appearance in Peacock Season !  
3	Just to be clear ,  me retweeting the Home Office was to bring your attention to that utterly disgusting tweet .  Not agreement . 
3	 @  _ raychul Tag you’re it !  Your head is made of wee 
3	 @ Brainmage Bought it last night and got addicted .  It is SO GREAT . 
3	 @ Coopleton 432 people are misguided enough to think that I am…
3	 @ mizbung I always spend far too much on headphones .  These are mine :  
3	Erm… Im just going to go ahead and click cancel .  
3	 @ DavidPuckridge  ( Ill stop now .  ) 
3	 @  _ raychul 2322 x
3	Just out getting a few quiet drinks with  @  _ raychul .  
3	 @ DavidPuckridge Also ,  I dont expect to love it all ,  but equally I dont expect to actively dislike it as much as I have lately . 
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer It also makes me angry that theyre telling ISPs to protect the children when parents should be doing that . 
3	OH GOD 
3	 @ mzlondon Maybe Ill avoid the drama that I had last year with ARGComFest clashing with a Murray final .  .  . 
3	 @ sarahbennetto  @ bechillcomedian Urban Cafe ? 
3	 @ RicherSounds Im a big fan and appreciate receiving your offers  -  but this seems somewhat excessive .  
3	 @ Bodminzer Finally the governments hypocrisy makes me angry :  Page 3 is FREEDOM OF THE PRESS yet online pornography is  " corroding childhood " 
3	 @ h2osarah Aaaaaaaaaa 
3	 @ mzlondon Indeed I do !   @ charlottelowey is my sister .   :  ) 
3	 @  _ raychul For any pedants reading this ,  I immediately corrected myself with :   " DASHES !  Different types of dashes !  " 
3	Well thats my Twitter bio updated…
3	 @ Coopleton zzzz
3	 @ stecks Other people keep asking this !  Has no one else discovered the timer on their phone cameras ?  !   :  ( 
3	 @ Rossaluss  @ charlottelowey Shes great ,  isnt she ?   :  ( 
3	 @ ivanogo  # FreelanceLife
3	Everyone I have ever emailed :  you just got a LinkedIn invitation from me .  LinkedIn is deceptive and manually cancelling 500 +  requests sucks . 
3	oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god 
3	 @ KatieBonna Just saw DGLS again at Latitude .  You two are the absolute best ! 
3	 @ charlottelowey Surely an arm is all that I need to vote anyway…
3	 @ mizbung One day I will make it to Japan ! 
3	Surprisingly few people aware of the National Service Act 2013 :  
3	 # CharlesDarwin  @ bbcbadults RT  @ BBCBreaking Jane Austen is to feature on the next £10 note  -  replacing Charles Darwin 
3	 @  _ raychul  @ howlieT  @ jameswalkerguy Pretty SCHLONG work ,  HEY OH ! 
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer The porn - free internet will still have violence ,  hate speech and questionable people that children shouldnt mix with . 
3	 @ h2osarah Mate ,  theres another day ! 
3	 @ Coopleton Theres the extra star ! 
3	 @ cioj  :  ( 
3	 @ michaelbell86 Sure ,  claim it here :  
3	 @ howlieT  @ maxandivan Pleasance website is still showing some left…
3	 @ Pappystweet  @ The _ Thnikkaman 23rd ,  surely ? 
3	Trying to find a source for a Wikipedia article and the only web pages that I can find all reference the Wikipedia article that I wrote . 
3	 @ Coopleton Its good though .  It makes everyone feel like were just hanging out .   # callback
3	 @ Bodminzer I dont think that liberals are pro - porn ,  as much as they are just anti - censorship  /  anti - internet filtering . 
3	 @ nachimir  @ Bodminzer Lots of non - adult sites blocked .  One big example being A Softer World coming up as  " adult content "  . 
3	 @ QueenoftheBerri Beta Males ,  Max and Ivan ,  Tim Key ,  McNeil and Pamphilon Go 8 - Bit !   ( joint effort of me and  @  _ raychul ) 
3	 @ howlieT  @ jameswalkerguy  @  _ raychul High fives all around yall
3	 @ RockstarSupport  @ Steam _ Support Any update on the Steam client bug that makes it impossible to play GTA III on a Mac ? 
3	Living dangerously .  
3	 @ stecks Is that you sitting on the next table over in this wonderful Edinburgh pub .  .  ? 
3	 @ QueenoftheBerri  @  _ raychul It was a time ! 
3	 @ DavidPuckridge I agree with all of this !  Moffat is great at standalone eps  ( Girl in the Fireplace ,  Blink )  but terrible at longer story arcs
3	 @ RockstarSupport  @ Steam _ Support Excellent ,  thank you !
