-0.22	Happy 15th Birthday to 
-0.22	So ,  Ill be buying both a new Chromebook and a Sonos 1 on my upcoming US trip .  The difference in price between US and UK is still ridiculous
-0.22	This looks brilliant .  Would be better if / when it can support chip and PIN for the UK market :  
-0.22	Very freaky .  Reflection on double glazing made it look like my sons Kermit the Frog cushion was driving my car .  
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Thanks Emma .  Know its been a tough night for you .  On train from Marylebone now .  Thanks for the help . 
-0.22	 @ m4tt Hmm .  Im thinking of it as a supplement to my iPad .  Sometimes a proper keyboard is just better and current laptop is slow ,  bulky  & amp ;  hot
-0.22	Interesting reading about the shift to focus on design first at Microsoft 
-0.22	 @ dylansmith Exactly .  Handset prices are coming down  & amp ;  people are more likely to want shorter term contracts .  30 day sim deals are the future
-0.22	 @ Cennydd  @ hellofisher  @ AaronGustafson 
-0.22	 @ dangrech That’s my point .  Focuses on company ,  not end customer experience .  With that said ,  we use them  too  ( sparingly )  .  Being idealistic .

-0.22	Yes they do ,   @ absoluteradio ,  yes they do  # captchafail 
-0.22	 @ VodafoneUKdeals 191 were about as helpful so I requested to terminate my contract .  Way to lose a long term customer . 
-0.22	Nice work  @ google for making QuickOffice free for all 
-0.22	Correct ,  this is brilliant .  RT  @ cicom :  Brilliant Lords Prayer parody using station names v .  funny  # tfl  # London 
-0.22	 @ neildodd  @ Cennydd  @ hellofisher  @ AaronGustafson Ah ,  its sequentially ,  not simultaneously .  My bad .  Still ,  makes me question mobile first . 
-0.22	It’s screwed up that the answer to a late train is to not pick up any more passengers along the way .   @ chilternrailway 
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Morning !  Don’t know its name ,  but the equipment above the seats is dripping water at the back of the 0720 from BCF . 
-0.22	Totally agree !  RT  @ rahelab  @ scottabel  @ wion  @ nozurbina But when the content at the end sucks ,  no one sits around praising the UX that tried . 
-0.22	Someone needs to turn the bass down in  # Beaconsfield .  House shaking from noise coming from the other side of the train tracks . 
-0.22	Just taken me 40 minutes from Marylebone to Primrose Hill on a packed bus of screaming kids on the way to the Zoo .  I’ve had better journeys .

-0.22	Hmm .  Facebook app crashing on loading news feed on both iPhone and iPad .  Looks like today’s update is the cause ? 
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Physically unable to squeeze on one of your trains .  Absolute ridiculous farce .  35 minutes to next one .  Poor ,  poor service
-0.22	Interesting to see  @ transportgovuk feeling a little the defensive this morning over  # HS2
-0.22	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion  .  .  .  But there are aspects outside of your control and constant surprise and learning .

-0.22	 @ m4tt Good move .  Vodafone refused to even come close on pricing or terms .  Its the way the world is going though as handset prices reduce . 
-0.22	Wow .  This is an incredible move by WH Smith .  
-0.22	Off to day 2 of  # csauk and to my first conference presentation  * ulp *  .  Come to my session for tips on User Experience based on real examples .

-0.22	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion its why testing is critical ,  but also what keeps working in UX fun and interesting for me .

-0.22	Brilliant insight into the evolution of Facebooks photo reporting tool from  @ domurphy at  # csauk  .  Fascinating stuff . 
-0.22	I’ve just been invited to a ‘Tweeting in Realtime Webinar’ .  Clearly all that tweeting in the past and future is where I’ve been going wrong .

-0.22	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion Personally ,  I work / design to  * influence *  the experience as much as I can within constraints . 
-0.22	Timehop reminding me of what I think is my favourite photo of Adam as a baby .  6 years ago today .  
-0.22	 @ AaronGustafson I think were arguing the same point  :  )  I just have a pet hate of the phrase mobile first and the connotations it suggests
-0.22	On this day last year .  What an amazing day it was too .   
-0.22	 @ think _ info  @ wion But does ‘adaptive’ = ‘put less on smaller screens’ ?  Suggests that mobile users want / need / deserve less content .  Always true ? 
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Hi Emma .  FGW not on ticket acceptance list ?  Can we take trains from Paddington to get a bus from Slough to Beaconsfield ? 
-0.22	 @ AaronGustafson i . e .  mobile prioritised to the exclusion of others .  Would rather focus my time on experience first ,  or customer first . 
-0.22	Loving todays Dilbert on closing Skype .  I remember lengthy discussions about why Quit wasnt in the menu bar .  
-0.22	 @ AaronGustafson Not disagreeing with that .  Arguing for understanding and catering for transition points between screens / experiences , 
-0.22	 @ danddu Other side of the tracks is all the million pound houses ,  so definitely the wrong side for me  :  ) 
-0.22	 @ ThomsonHolidays Not yet .  Were more hop on a bus and explore kind of people ,  but will take a look . 
-0.22	 @ rahelab  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ izahoor  @ wion Pleased to  spark such debate !  I think youre all right - quite hard to express in 140 chars . 
-0.22	 @ m4tt Quick search suggests its affecting lots of people .  I smell a story brewing  :  )

-0.22	 @ m4tt Im very tempted .  Why not for you ? 
-0.22	 @ timehop Hi Timehop folks .  No Facebook photos are loading for me anymore .  It just displays a timeout error .  Known problem or just me ? 
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Yes .  Now going be horrendously late for work .  How can you not plan for increased summer capacity on busy trains ?

-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Morning .  Big thanks to lady on info kiosk at Marylebone last night who helped me get a forgotten phone back to a colleague ! 
-0.22	Brilliant .  Search for lets go caroling in Google from a mobile phone . 
-0.22	 @ AaronGustafson  [ … ]   * and * identifying and supporting opportunities to transition between them is different to ‘mobile first’ .

-0.22	 @ dangrech Prove youre a human shouldnt really be needed at all .  Forces each customer to takes steps to solve issues caused by minority . 
-0.22	Nice reassuring message from driver on this train .  We’re only allowed to do 20 mph because of a ‘slight bump’ in the track . 
-0.22	 @ VodafoneUKdeals Hi .  I’m due an upgrade ,  but have bought my own phone .  What’s your best sim only deal with at least 1GB data ? 
-0.22	 @ RichMartell very nice !  Where’s that ?

-0.22	 @ NRE _ Chiltern how would that affect Paddington to slough ?  No matter now anyway ,  on a Marylebone train . 
-0.22	 @ akscutt  @ ranh76 the guy running the cornish pasty place in Marylebone had a good night at least .  He had one pasty left when I got there . 
-0.22	Just booked my second  @ FirstChoiceUK holiday of the year ,  to a hotel we first stayed in four years ago .  Im definitely a creature of habit . 
-0.22	 @ FirstChoiceUK Hotel  & amp ;  area are great .  Perfect balance between plenty to do and relaxing .  Late booking so decided to go with what we know  :  ) 
-0.22	I tried hard to like Gmails tabbed inbox ,  but switched it off as I kept missing stuff .  Seems targeted at people who dont like to read email
-0.22	 @ dangrech no ,  but a week in the Canary Islands obviously had more impact than I thought !   :  ) 
-0.22	Loving your work ,  fella 
-0.22	 @ AaronGustafson  @ Cennydd  @ hellofisher appreciating that people transition  * across platforms *  is a different strategy from focus on mobile
-0.22	 @ nozurbina  @ arockley Little bit of confusion between hardware and software here .  My old iPad 2 is still running the latest operating system . 
-0.22	 @ Bluegrass _ BBQ Great news !  Thanks for replying .  Best of luck with the launch !

-0.22	Bringing shiny new iOS brightness to an otherwise dull morning .  Looking forward to having a play .  
-0.22	 @ NRE _ Chiltern Theres a bus from Slough to Beaconsfield .  FGW was actually a valid alternative route but wasnt communicated by you or CR
-0.22	 @ FGW are you accepting tickets for stranded chiltern passengers to get to slough from Paddington ? 
-0.22	 @ dangrech Exactly
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Hi Chiltern Railways folks .  Hope you had a good Christmas .  Is Beaconsfield ticket office open on New Years Day please ? 
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway Thanks for reply .  Really difficult circumstances I know ,  but none of your Comms said so until too late to be helpful .

-0.22	 @ glencooley Colmans every time ! 
-0.22	 @ rahelab  @ izahoor  @ nozurbina  @ scottabel  @ wion of course .  Not suggesting that the presentation of content is more important than accuracy .

-0.22	Not the best end to Monday .  
-0.22	 @ AaronGustafson point I was making  ( badly )  earlier is that understanding and playing to strengths of devices and platforms  [ … ] 
-0.22	 @ chilternrailway I presume I can claim on the charter for not being able to board and therefore being late ?

-0.22	 @ ironfroggy Ha !   :  )

-0.22	Thanks for the free fruit  @ chilternrailway .   What was that all about ?   :  ) 
-0.22	Interesting news !  “ @ mickbirch :  We just bought Bebo back for  $ 1m .  Can we actually re - invent it ?  Who knows ,  but it will be fun trying .  .  . ”
