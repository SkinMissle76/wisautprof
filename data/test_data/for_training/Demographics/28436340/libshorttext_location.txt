7	Im going crazy !  These people ordering dont have any common sense whatsoever .  It should take 10mins to order pay and receive you food . 
7	Twitter and Facebook and MySpace and the rest of the like all suck ,  and I hate them all .  Die social media die and burn in a horrible fire !  ! 
7	 @ gSe7eN Happy Fathers Day ,  to the father of my two kids !  Im never on twitter but this seemed like a good reason to get on ,  Im off to bed ! 
7	Im not hella cheep ,  but the dollar store is the best place ever for odds and ends ! 
7	Tomorrow is my cute little girls birthday !  She will be two !  Im gonna make this as much fun as I can with stuff from the Dollar Store ! 
7	Im  " tweeting "  a lot because I have not much to do tonight ,  and FB is being a bore !  !  Blah ! 
7	Being 21 is weird .  I still feel like drinking is dumb ,  but for some reason I dont mind anymore .  Being  " of age "  really makes this more fun ! 
7	I was kinda getting bored ,  and sober ,  so I had some more of my drink and now Im being silly again . 
7	Benjamen is talking to his friend ,  but I want him to come inside because I miss him and I want cookies !   @ gSe7eN
7	I just took a shower today ,  but because Ive been drinking I will use to take another tomorrow .   Yay showers !  ! 
7	 @ gSe7eN  is not replying to my messages .  What an ass .   :  ) 
7	 @ sam _ is _ me Guinness should give me a Guinness for each tweet I have ever made .  Because Im awesome .   : D  & lt ;  -  cheesy smile . 
7	Tweet 415 !  !  !  Woo !  And it only took me three years !  Im breaking records over here guys !  Call Guinness ! 
7	Ugh . I give myself headaches almost every time I get on here . Prob why I stick to the retardation of Facebook . Internet on a whole is lousy .   :  ) 
7	I went  " running "  yesterday . More like slow jog , and fast walk .  I dont like it , but if I want to not be a lazy fat welfare mom , then Ill do it . 
7	Hi twitter .  Blah blah blah something about what Im doing ,  blah blah doe de doe de da de dum la la lala le la la lala bah ! 
7	Getting hugs from my bf when he doesnt usually give them ,  makes the ones I get feel better .   :  )   & lt ; 3 I like hugs .   : D
7	Im not saying that I wouldnt wear a wedding band because of reason  " A "  I would just suck it up .  Because I love the person Im gonna marry . 
7	I know ,  I know , I am The smartest !   Revolutionary !  # engagementnecklace
7	I would rather have an engagement necklace something really simple and pretty that I could wear under my shirt and wouldnt have to take off
7	And B )  Im a working mother of two ,  who cant wear rings with stones in them at work .  I would have to take it off and put it on all the time
7	Ive never wanted an engagement ring for two reasons .  A )  I think rings make my hands look really stupid # rings
7	Have to be at work in an hr and 20 mins .   : p before I leave I have to  # dodishes  # changekids  # makebottles  # getdressed  # feedfish  # cleanhouse
7	But on the bright side I only work until 3 !  Yay !  !  !   : D and maybe Ill go to church tonight and take tomorrow for myself ! 
7	Oh ,  its going to be a not good day for me .  I feel sick ,  and I got a really bad leg crap that still hurts like hell to walk on .   # suckyday  :  ( 
7	 @ gSe7eN wow I vote for an eviction from America !  They obv dont want to be here anyway . 
7	I keep forgetting how much I lose when I go to work .  Makes me dislike my job more and more .  But if this is what it takes to raise my family . 
7	 @ borbyterror  @ no _ randy  I hate you both .  .  . I totally forgot that your both in LA and can see each other whenever you want .  Hate you .  So much . 
7	 @ borbyterror someday youll be big and famous . and then Ill say  " I knew him ,  he was a tool "  cuz thats what ppl say about famous ppl . 
7	 @ borbyterror hehehe !  This is so like you !   : D I wanna hear ! 
7	 @ borbyterror  I cant believe your in a boy - band !  Are you guys any good ?  Now be honest !   & lt ; 3
7	Because everyone should just complain about the ppl in there lives , all the damn time , heaven forbid were happy for a min * sigh  ( rolls eyes )  * 
7	I think I like the father of my children .  OH NO !  WHAT WILL I EVER DO ?  !  AHHHH !  !  !  !  !  ! 
7	Today was long .  I need to go to bed .   :  ) 
7	Having kids shouldnt be thought of as a burden ,  but rather ,  a chance to pass down your beliefs , and form a work of art that is a good person
7	People think raising children is a chore ,  no its not .  Its a blessing .  Stop thinking of it as work ,  its not  " work "  ,  its your legacy . 
7	I hate when I take over a post with comments ,  and then someone else chimes in with a 1 word comment ,  and kills the whole convo I was having . 
7	 @ borbyterror Ive become better at holding it in ,  but as a result I just dont talk to anyone anymore .  Hahaha
7	 @ borbyterror when are you gonna come visit me ?  !  I can drink again ,  we still need to celebrate our awesome birthdays ! 
7	 @ borbyterror I miss you .  When I get mad I think of how I used to rant to you and you would just sit there and take it .  Haha  & lt ; 3
7	I need to let some things go ,  and stop holding grudges .  I miss not freaking out over everything and anything .  I want to care less again .   :  ) 
7	some things suck .  And once they get good again ,  its hard to think that it will stay good .  Its living in fear of the past that sucks .
