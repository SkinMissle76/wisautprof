17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Thanks for the context ! 
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Have I missed something ? 
17	The baby opposite me on the tube not only is making a noise disproportionate to its size but looks like it might puke on me any moment now
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Not to mention yachts
17	 @ DanPBaldwin I thought they were good .  Well worth a watch
17	Great service at  # houseoffraser croydon from the Sheridan lady in the bedding department .  A credit to the store
17	Loving the Dr Who Prom on  # bbc2
17	Would anyone like to give a new home to a budgie ? 
17	Weird instructions on my new roasting tin ;  it says they recommend that birds should not be kept in the kitchen .  .  .  ? 
17	 @ raching63 wrap yourself up in hamster fluff to keep warm and dry
17	Lights are flickering  - power cut looming ? 
17	You need an umbrella inside the  @ Morrisons store in Sutton  -  never seen so many leaks
17	Why on earth I agreed to a 9am opticians appointment Ive no idea .  I can barely open my eyes let alone focus on anything
17	 @ thomasbrake  Your active involvement with the train companies is much appreciated
17	Aaaagh ,  going absolutely nowhere on the circle line
17	Scotland will just have to do with the runner up prize of Sports Personality and not  # xfactor winner
17	This restaurant I am in is so poncy I need to search Google to understand the menu
17	 @ DANJO _ UK its truly pathetic that they cant leave the guy alone ,  although its the same treatment for all celebrities sadly
17	 @ DANJO _ UK my star sign never changes
17	 @ NRE _ Southern trains through Carshalton

17	Researching Brighton as a potential destination for a house move today
17	Oh ,  its afternoon
17	I know the gym is indoors but I really cant face opening the front door this morning
17	Unusually disappointing food at  @ pret in the Strand today .  Poor stock and tepid soup .  Not up to your usual standards .

17	Catastrophe at work .  Seriously hoping the backup system works .  .  .

17	 @ tfl  @ SouthernRailUK even now Im finally home ,  I can see no explanation of why Victoria was so badly affected this evening . 
17	 @ NRE _ Southern there arent any trains .  .  . 
17	 @ SouthernRailUK  You are a total disgrace .  You may not be responsible for the incident but to pretend to run trains is not acceptable
17	 @ victorialine  There was no explanation or announcement on my train about not stopping at Victoria or indeed why .  Not acceptable
17	 @ SouthernRailUK  would it have been more helpful to actually explain what was going on so we could have made alternative ways homem
17	Only one option  -  the pub
17	Train meltdown .  Still trying to get home .   # notimpressed
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk its not even December !  ! 
17	Article in The Metro today on how mushrooms control the weather .   @ LastNation it seems your wariness is justified  # whowouldhavethought

17	Why have Bitcoins only suddenly come to my attention ? 
17	Anyway Gravity was an amazing film .  Highly recommended . 
17	The film has ended and theyre still making comments
17	Seem to have seriously upset two people at the cinema by sitting in front if them .  They havent stopped complaining for the last 10 minutes
17	Always a good idea to leave for work with your laptop bag instead of your gym kit .  .  .   # notawakeyet
17	Thank you  @ SP _ EnergyPeople for resolving my outstanding query via Twitter .  Great service . 
17	Just ask !  Youve annoyed people so thats why they wont offer . 
17	Most annoying people on the train :  Complaining about people sitting in priority seats but not actually asking if anyone would give one up
17	Im loving my new Nexus 5  # Nexus5
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk is it time to get up yet .  .  . 
17	 @ liamj4mes with or without the instructor ?

17	 @ LastNation what a wimp  # neitheramI
17	So my sons football predictions have failed to win us the £1m super Sunday 6 competition .  Theres always next week I suppose
17	Well I think my wedding officiating went rather well even though I say it myself  # smug
17	Paper ,  a guillotine ,  pritstick and its all sorted .  Those school craft lessons were worth it after all

17	Oh take it back  .  He smiles at Germans only  # stillmiserablesod
17	Why does the hospitality industry appeal to people who are inhospitable ?   # miserablesod
17	Its nice to be invited ,  but not to play candy crush  # pleasestop
17	 @ rickytheodosio  @ GreatBritDriver I see it has an illustrious followers list so far .  .  . 
17	The guy who made this came to my table to take a photo of it .  Strange ,  no ?  
17	 @ thomasbrake better to have a partnered post office than no post office at all
17	 @ JorieJay thanks ,  thats nice to know .  .  . 
17	 "  @ SteveChalke :  If you are the smartest person in the room ,  find another room .  "  Food for thought
17	Didnt think Id  ever be in a British pub in Spain but theres no way the hotel would ever show an England game unless it was vs Germany
17	But ,  hey  Im reading it anyway .  So there
17	With more than 90 %  of the hotel occupancy German ,  perhaps my choice of book about Bletchley Park was ,  in retrospect ,  slightly insensitive
17	German sun bed reservations have reached new heights  -   people are taking parts of the beds to their rooms  # aretherenolimits
17	 @ PatrickStrud  @ Philippa _ Perry Thanks ,   it has made my day
17	Up an hour early because my phone thinks the time is an hour later than it actually is  # annoying

17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Hows the baby maintenence going ? 
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk no we ran out of time
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk It moves into second place behind Bournemouth in Bens ranking
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Nice place ,   havent been there for over 20 years .   University is good and apart from the  HR  lecturer have a good account
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk yep
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Off to Portsmouth  :  any tips ? 
17	Thinking of swapping my rucksack for a massive over the shoulder bag I so I can assault the entire train carriage like many women do
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Have been listening to Bastille all afternoon but no sign of baby
17	Been in a meeting this afternoon where I was called Keith repeatedly .  Anyone top that ?   @ b0ringtweets
17	 @ TfLOfficial these new h & amp ; c trains are great but theres not enough handrails in the sections where the carriages join for those standing
17	To the girl behind me coughing ,  COVER YOUR MOUTH
17	Its kind of nice when people offer me a seat on the train but it does make me feel old .  .  .   # doireallylookthatold
17	Ann I the only person not to have found  The IT Crowd not particularly funny ? 
17	Just  @ TefalUK who dont seem to care about their customers or reputation
17	Well done  @ BTCare for resolving my complaint .  Thank you
17	So sweet to have a four day old baby visit my house today .  Takes me back .  .  . 
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk presumably you took him with you ! 
17	Definitely entering that one as long as you dont have to store it somewhere
17	Apparently this is 15 packs of Andrex®Classic White 9roll ,  which equates to the average use for one person in one year .  Pretty generous
17	Offer of a lifetime received by email this morning :   " win a years supply of toilet paper "   # excited
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Er ,  why would you wake a sleeping baby ?  ? 
17	 @ LastNation  @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Well  ,  call it a coincidence but  at 9 . 07 this morning  .  .  .  I was fast asleep
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk  @ LastNation Fantastic news !  And all without any assistance from me . 
17	Apparently someone has booked a table under my name at  @ zizzi in Banstead tonight .  Shame Im in Southport .  .  . 
17	 "  @ Loulou _ Uberkirk :   # GoodMorning what are your Saturday plans ?  "  A stroll along the seafront ,  afternoon tea on the pier and theatre tonight
17	Currently at the top of the Blackpool Tower trying to get down
17	Currently at the top of the Blackpool Tower waiting for the firework display to start
17	Finally got around to seeing  @ lesmisofficial the film .  Truly amazing . 
17	 @ TefalUK doesnt expect their saucepans to last longer than a year .  Very poor customer service .  And no ,  I dont want new ones for 50 %  off . 
17	Anyone would think I was  @ ScottishPower s biggest spending  ( ex )  customer .  Seriously guys  ,  please stop ringing  -  Im not coming back .  Ever . 
17	How can an IOS7 update possibly take 32 hours  ?  Glad Im not with Apple
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Do you think you might need parbuckling
17	 @ bananagiraffes Brilliant news ! 
17	Weve all learnt a new word in the last two days  :   # parbuckling
17	Yesterday the S3 bus didnt turn up .  Today there are twice as many people on board as usual .  Why ? 
17	Got quite excited by Evening Standard article on season tickets for people who dont commute 5 days a week .  Hope  @ thomasbrake supports
17	I think I must have grown taller over the weekend .  Ive hit my head twice on things already today . 
17	 @ thomasbrake Excellent
17	 "  @ Loulou _ Uberkirk :   # GoodMorning Happy Friday !  What are your weekend plans ?  "  I am going to try very hard to do nothing ! 
17	The biggest waste of a day I can recall .  Seriously wish I hadnt got out of bed
17	 @ CMusters Hope youre correcting the spelling .  .  .  . 
17	 @ marksandspencer managed to get a fork from  @ costacoffee thanks
17	How does anyone know if they are paying the correct train fare these days ?  Quoted three different prices for the same journey
17	 @ marksandspencer Sutton out of forks but still selling food which requires one .   # fail
17	You know ,  I really dont care about tonights Apple launch
17	This one has a particularly powerful lungs
17	The disadvantage of getting an early train is the presence of a screaming baby
17	Left work early  # thatstoldthem
17	Still reflecting on yesterdays conversation at work .  If I didnt have my eye on the end game ,  Id be tempted to use grievance procedures
17	Yay ,  finally a sparkly new train at rush hour on the circle line .  Thanks  @ TfLOfficial
17	On the positive side ,  my long term plan might be coming together . 
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Good for you .  Its not like you sprang a surprise on them
17	Just leaving the London office .  After the most important conversation of the day ,  I really do wonder why I bother
17	Seriously enjoying this late summer .  So great to be in London
17	When its sunny and warm and no one on the bus is speaking English ,  its like being on holiday  # lovelondon
17	About to ride on my first Boris bus  # excited
17	Guy at Trafalgar Square this evening has asked no fewer than 6 people to take his photo .  Obviously not happy with quality of the camera work
17	 @ LastNation Sometimes helps to catch some of the sick
17	Being crapped on by a pigeon wasnt in the plan today .  Makes a change from colleagues I suppose
17	Two mew members of staff joining my team today .  So long since this happened ,  Ive almost forgotten how to do an induction
17	I know Im a little behind watching this ,  but why are they so keen on Tamera ?  Full of confidence maybe ,  but so flat  # XFactor No from me
17	Excellent meal at  @ spicemarketLDN tonight .  Great service ,  flavoursome food
17	Looks like my second in command at work will be returning after convalescence in a couple of weeks .   # happytimes
17	 @ Loulou _ Uberkirk Do you have his and her phones ? 
17	Exactly how many Homes Under The Hammer are there ?   # spendingtimewisely
17	This is supposed to be a day off and here I am dealing with work problems on the phone .  Turning it off until Wednesday
17	Plenty of train announcements but none that are needed .  Such as  " Please would all parents keep their children under control "
