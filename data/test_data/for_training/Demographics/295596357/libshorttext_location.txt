41	 @ adamchapman Its  # PardewOut mate .  All his fault apparently .  Were only six points off the CL spots . 
41	 @ Matt _ Rant players need to carry the can for that .  Switched off at 1 - 0 by the sound of it . 
41	 @ davidallison88 stealing our jobs while at the same time leeching off the dole .  Must be a talented bunch .

41	 @ JamieSmiff to be fair it IS more important than Burnley being top at Christmas . 
41	Do I stay up for the first few hours of a pointless test match or go to bed in preparation for the football ? 
41	 @ FingerOfBungle Steven Taylor will be wondering when his Twitter feed has went quiet . 
41	 @ dantyte almost makes Xisco look like good deal . 
41	I say this every Christmas but Ive no idea how the Queen is seen as anything other than an absolute travesty .  Were a democratic country . 
41	A matter of days after  @  _ Half _ A _ Person bumps into  @ Swannyg66 he retires .  What did you bloody say to him ? 
41	I regret nothing .  
41	 @ FingerOfBungle stick to pitch invading kidda ,  weve got the monopoly on animal cruelty .  .  . unless its police dogs . 
41	 @ up2web  @ Econsultancy I second this .  Thankfully I worked out how to block them . 
41	 @ scottgoodacre  @ matt _ rant I think hes began to look weaker as Debuchy has hit form .  Dont think well be in a rush to sell . 
41	 @ JamieSmiff  @ adamchapman nee idea .  They probably think wed be in for Bielsa . 
41	 @ geordiedentist Mark Hughes has more to worry about than the quality of handshakes .

41	 @ MarkGrainger Prince rumours ? 
41	 @ JamieSmiff  @ StephenMilnes  @ scottgoodacre why on Earth is Altidore starting ahead of him ?  Hes useless . 
41	At least last season we put out a starting XI that left the fans in no doubt we wanted out of the FA Cup .  Chucked that way today  # nufc
41	LOCK DOWN LADS !   "  @ pipogypopotamus :  THERES FUCKING ROMANIANS AND BULGARIANS EVERYWHERE .  WERE BEING FUCKING INVADED !  " 
41	Some saying AP will whinge about tiredness yet doesnt rotate the squad .  Look at the quality we have on the bench .  .  .  
41	 @ eastcoastuk howay man ,  this is ludicrous .  After two hours I get to the Journey Details page and get an error . 
41	Great deck from  @ dancall .  10 trends to watch out for in 2014  -  
41	Incredibly busy morning ,  most of which has been spent swearing under my breath at Illustrator .  I  & lt ; 3 making infographics . 
41	Deserved red for Debuchy .  Cant dive in like that nowadays even if he did take the ball  # nufc
41	 @ Matt _ Rant Ill be doing the same if I hear the words  " Ronnie "  and  " Radford " 
41	Looking forward to a night of  # PardewIn  # PardewOut bitching on here ,  despite him playing a strong team .  Players at fault today  # NUFC
41	 @ adamf2384 the fans ruin it . 
41	 @ JamieSmiff  @ adamchapman  @ OnlineRule or tweet  " GET JUNIOR ON !  !  !  "  every five bloody minutes . 
41	Id point to this as an example of bad  # PR ,  but then this is the  # BNP  -  
41	Mike Williamson is one of the few Premier League centre backs who can handle Luis Suarez  # GetMikeToManaus
41	What a  # darts match this is by the way !  Smith and Wright at the top of their games . 
41	 @ JF _ 247 not really .  Under Allardyce we were in danger of being dragged into a relegation battle ,  this year were 6 points off fourth . 
41	 @ geordiedentist  @ NUFCThreatLevel Norwich turned down our £20 ticket offer but have agreed to others .  They know they can fleece our fans . 
41	I dont know much about  # NFL but THAT was a cracking game .  Great entertainment . 
41	 @ leazeslad we were top of the league 12 years ago tomorrow . 
41	 @ lukeymoore I want high averages and everyone who sings that Yaya / Kolo Toure song put to death .  Too much to ask ? 
41	 @ JordanStiva  @ toonlowdown couldnt cope with the gameplan .  Krul  -  & gt ;  Shola  -  & gt ;  Demba  -  & gt ;  Goal  # PardewThat
41	Disappointed to lose but a canny performance from  # nufc .  Add a player or two in Jan and well be top 6 .
