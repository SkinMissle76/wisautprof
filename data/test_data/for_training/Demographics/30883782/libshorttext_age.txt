-0.54	 @ alexhern well it’s not really Ireland’s law that are problem .  We define place of establishment in our law that permits this .

-0.54	 @ benjaminfgray You might very well say that
-0.54	 @ Badgerbarrett can’t get on because of Playstation !  !  White Collar is a great series though .  A bit like a slightly weak American Hustle . 
-0.54	Wonder how much of a past fare rise went on installing a network of smart card pedestals ,  only to cover them all up .
