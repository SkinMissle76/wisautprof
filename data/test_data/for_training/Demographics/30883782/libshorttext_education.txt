3	Amazons tax arrangements are nothing short of a work of art .  Bravo !   |  Comment is free  |  The Observer  
3	Falsetto Dracula  # eurovision
3	 @ alexhern Not really .  Another sovereign state setting their tax rate and winning at competition .  It’s UKGov that are making avoidance doable
3	 @ alexmuller first a train ,  now this !  Skydiving next ? 
3	That flaming dress used up  # eurovision’s colour budget for the year
3	 @ SW _ Trains Do you know when the next London - bound train from Oxshott will be ?  Board said 1631 on time but no show .

3	 @ alexforey Don’t know it .  Looks nice though . 
3	 @ alexforey I can actually imagine this going down very well on a club cheese floor  # eurovision  # finland
3	First morning of travel chaos .  Sardines on train as  @ sw _ trains thought another line needed one train set more and now seemingly no 521 . 
3	That too frequent dilemma between making the train without a ticket or waiting 30 mins but paying .  SWT should probably make that better . 
3	 @ MartinPong The inevitable collections panic / nightmare ? 
3	 @ benjaminfgray She previewed it on Graham Norton a few weeks ago .  Unfortunately not a shock

3	Schneier on Security :  Our Internet Surveillance State

3	 @ SW _ Trains Ok .  Are we talking 30 mins ,  an hour ,  two ? 
3	 @ zethraeus Sorry then .  You said TLDR .  Then I’m small c conservative too ,  I guess .  Unsurprised .  Those were my concerns .  Gulags least so . 
3	Recommend you read  @ alexforeys letter to his MP about the filtering proposals .  Very strong 
3	Local workmen appear .  One from gas board did impromptu gas check .  Impressive . 
3	The Great British Bake Off :  why did our show attract so much vitriol ?  
3	 @ alexmuller literally thousands of wasted keystrokes not knowing that . 
3	Well at least Cascada is getting the party going  # eurovision  # germany
3	Boris could be shown eating a puffin and it would be good press ,  Osbourne is ridiculed for a hamburger from the wrong restaurant
3	Have been enjoying  @ ThreeUK’s europass but them turning off everyone’s international roaming for a weekend is annoying
3	If there is such a thing as perfect timing for data privacy revelations ,  the day before  @ openrightsgroup  # ORGCon is probably it . 
3	From a layman’s perspective ,  Rageh Omar’s programmes on Turkey and the Ottomans on BBC have been very good . 
3	 @ alexforey That piece is so poorly thought out .  It’s like smoking in a restaurant .  X’s ancillary pleasure is decreasing Y’s primary .

3	 @ amos _ jackson I thought the first season was a bit average but this season is excellent . 
3	Five hours chasing a server PHP config error that it turns out I created in the first place years ago .  Probably a lesson there…
3	The whole  @ bbcqt audience just hit Good Energy’s site and took it down . 
3	The Economist :  The strange rebirth of liberal England  & lt ;  Interesting and quite encouraging if true

3	 @ coffeemadman Let it take you .  You won’t regret it .

3	 @ coffeemadman Season 2 was a good one .  Haha one definitely has to keep paying attention .  The storyline is brilliant . 
3	 @ alexhern well it’s not really Ireland’s law that are problem .  We define place of establishment in our law that permits this . 
3	 @ alexhern  +  trying to solve by complaining at Ireland probs as effective as trying to make Google pay by saying it’s unfair of them not to . 
3	 @ mrchrisaddison  @ bbceurovision Μαδηεςς ?  It’s ΣΠΑΡΤΑ !  !

3	 @ zethraeus p2  -  flippancy ,  p3 & amp ; 6  -  engagement ,  p7  -  voting is good ,  p8  -  dangerous style ,  p10  -  gulags
3	 @ alexmuller What was the event ? 
3	MT “ @ 1755Dictionary :  Ebriety  ( n .  )  Drunkenness ;  intoxication by strong liquors . ”  & lt ;  always wondered what the antonym of sobriety was . 
3	 @ samparkercouk it’s ‘how do you do ? ’ for the 21st century . 
3	£10 each off Ardbeg and Dalmore in waitrose because they’re end of life .  Bargain ! 
3	 @ alexhern don’t favour co vilification for 2 reasons 1 :  let’s Gov get away with not making effective law  & amp ;  2 :  risks UK certainty of position
3	 @ JontySteinfeld Spritz ?  Can’t say I’m a fan… Enjoy the sun though !

3	If my rate of battery life consumption is indicative ,  my iPhone and iPad tire as rapidly as I do in this heat…
3	 @ flamsmark perhaps they’re 500ml .  I found the opposite in Europe .  They used 568ml glasses but only filled to 500ml .  Always felt cheated
3	Now fire brigade have appeared .  Frankly impressive response .  Feeling safer ,  if somewhat shaken ,  in London . 
3	Those petals in a box had a feel of the crystal maze about them  # eurovision
3	The cat never moves more swiftly or silently than when mounting the kitchen unit to take a bite of my lunch whilst my back is turned .  Never . 
3	 @ alexmuller Good thing we didn’t do that then ! 
3	Wish I’d waited before fb spat re Brand’s piece .  All I wanted to say is here ;  funnier  & amp ;  smarter than I could manage 
3	Like  @ timmontgomerie’s Borgen - esque new UK pol parties in Times .  Too much compromise to vote for any current .  None sufficiently represent me
3	Home after my first exam to discover that the crucial home plug next to the router has decided to stop connecting to the others .  Unhappy . 
3	 @ benjaminfgray You might very well say that
3	 @ Badgerbarrett can’t get on because of Playstation !  !  White Collar is a great series though .  A bit like a slightly weak American Hustle . 
3	Wonder how much of a past fare rise went on installing a network of smart card pedestals ,  only to cover them all up . 
3	Tax - Free Radicals from  @ nsfwcorp .  Well worth a read 
3	 @ Badgerbarrett Got to feed it with two months of brandy !  ! 
3	 @ alexmuller Interesting to see how they manage that .  Still considering my scattergun SAR approach .  .  .
