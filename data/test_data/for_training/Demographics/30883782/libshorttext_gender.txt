-1	That flaming dress used up  # eurovision’s colour budget for the year

-1	 @ alexforey I can actually imagine this going down very well on a club cheese floor  # eurovision  # finland
-1	First morning of travel chaos .  Sardines on train as  @ sw _ trains thought another line needed one train set more and now seemingly no 521 . 
-1	That too frequent dilemma between making the train without a ticket or waiting 30 mins but paying .  SWT should probably make that better .

-1	Boris could be shown eating a puffin and it would be good press ,  Osbourne is ridiculed for a hamburger from the wrong restaurant
-1	Have been enjoying  @ ThreeUK’s europass but them turning off everyone’s international roaming for a weekend is annoying
-1	If there is such a thing as perfect timing for data privacy revelations ,  the day before  @ openrightsgroup  # ORGCon is probably it .

-1	 @ alexhern well it’s not really Ireland’s law that are problem .  We define place of establishment in our law that permits this . 
-1	 @ alexhern  +  trying to solve by complaining at Ireland probs as effective as trying to make Google pay by saying it’s unfair of them not to .

-1	 @ samparkercouk it’s ‘how do you do ? ’ for the 21st century . 
-1	£10 each off Ardbeg and Dalmore in waitrose because they’re end of life .  Bargain ! 
-1	 @ alexhern don’t favour co vilification for 2 reasons 1 :  let’s Gov get away with not making effective law  & amp ;  2 :  risks UK certainty of position
-1	 @ JontySteinfeld Spritz ?  Can’t say I’m a fan… Enjoy the sun though !

-1	Like  @ timmontgomerie’s Borgen - esque new UK pol parties in Times .  Too much compromise to vote for any current .  None sufficiently represent me

-1	 @ benjaminfgray You might very well say that
-1	 @ Badgerbarrett can’t get on because of Playstation !  !  White Collar is a great series though .  A bit like a slightly weak American Hustle . 
-1	Wonder how much of a past fare rise went on installing a network of smart card pedestals ,  only to cover them all up . 
-1	Tax - Free Radicals from  @ nsfwcorp .  Well worth a read 
-1	 @ Badgerbarrett Got to feed it with two months of brandy !  !
