-1	St Leo ,  Ahuntsic ,  St Mich ,  Montreal - Nord ,  Ville Emard / Verdun .  Notice theres no West Island in there .   # NotADiss  # JustNotMuchMoney
-1	Fun fact :  I was born in St Leo ,  but I managed to escape the sting of corruption ,  so far at least .  .  . 
-1	I mean ,  10 years ago I never imagined my life would be this great .  Minimal pleasure but Ive come to understand that life is good AND tough .

-1	Let me just say that City Hall is a bunch of bullshit .  Wait til I get in there .   # YallThinkImPlaying  # HeyThereMrMayor  ;  ) 
-1	5  -  Simply put ,  if you cant cook ,  I cant keep you around .  I cant either but I cant kick myself out of wherever I am . 
-1	4  -  A woman gets three gifts MINIMUM a year ,  so understand I respect that .  If I make the time ,  its cause I care for you . 
-1	3  -  I would prefer a girl I can trust with a business .  One who does not fuck around when it comes down to it .  Kinda like Tony Soprano .   # RIP
-1	2  -  Sex is a two - person effort .  I dont wanna be the only one killing it .  Besides ,  that actually makes YOU look bad ,  girl . 
-1	1  -  I text more than I call .  Unless were exclusive ,  the only time youll hear my voice is if you call in the early stages . 
-1	Every persons got a list of standards for their potential partners .  Mine goes something like this :  .  .  .

-1	Just do it for you and rep your whole nation /  Generation in relation ,  so let this be your motivation
-1	No limit to my capacity ,  call me the powerhouse /  Get haters running so scared ,  its like we playing cat and mouse
-1	Legend in the making like him ,  you just sit back and watch /  Bloodstains on my shirt or just one tiny blotch
-1	Be quick on your toes ,  carry no worries and no woes /  Get tough soon ,  get well soon ,  word to D Rose
-1	Like we done messed with their minds ,  Jenga scattered all over the place /  Dumbfounded when the see us styling ,  looking with that DUH face
-1	A real fighter ,  thats who we are ,  fuck our opponents /  Cause respecting them has just made their bias a bigger proponent
-1	 @ JustBeeREAL new verse posting ,  already two stanzas up  :  )   # IfYoureInterested
-1	And as for me I say that Im mostly feared but not scary /  I never knew her personally ,  but rest in peace Queen Sherri
-1	This life is not truly what its cut out to be /  Trying to keep ourselves busy we start to lose it dramatically
-1	This one right here for the fighters in the world .  Not the boxing ring ,  just the pure fighters .  Through the struggle and all .   @ JustBeeREAL
-1	I wish one day I could link my life experiences together .  Like a reunion where theres people Ive known or will know throughout my life . 
-1	Third shoutout goes to  @ therealmikenaps  !  Has it really been almost 9 years ?  Good to see you at ConU doing your thing man !

-1	Theres a reason why  @ thegame and  @ Colbyodonis are following me and I follow back .  I highly respect them and honoured that they following ! 
-1	I miss a lot of people .  The feeling might not be mutual ;  just thought Id let you guys know . 
-1	Whoever I meet in life ,  I dont care where you came from .  Your name mean 0 to me unless we built a strong relationship .  Or you an athlete . 
-1	 @ JustBeeREAL its the worst .  Going off on a rant now but Ill just say that being straight up causes less problems  # TakeHeedFellas
-1	At the end of the day ,  as I go on a  @ iFucksWithThat type rant ,  its me vs .  the world .  Bring it the fuck on ,   # ImReady  # WordToSpongebob  # YAYA
-1	Take the time to think during the day .  Take 20 mins to sit and mull over all kinds of shit .  Scrap the unnecessary and keep the influential . 
-1	Personally speaking ,  I can say I welcome death .  Not suicidal at all ;  since I know its coming ,  why try to deny it in the first place ? 
-1	Off of  @ JustBeeREAL tweet ,  I really see no reason to lie if youre breaking up .  Shit ,  thats when all the secrets supposed to POUR out . 
-1	 @ JustBeeREAL yeah apparently cause being straight up went out of style .  Buncha denying - ass pussies .  .  . hahahaha  # StraightUpOrShutUp
