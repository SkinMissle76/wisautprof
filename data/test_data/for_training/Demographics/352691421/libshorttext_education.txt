2	The Besides parts of Vine are incredible .  Its like a minds inner working on film . 
2	 @ WWEDanielBryan Thank you for being a proud Washingtonian and shouting out the  @ Seahawks  !   # yesyesyes  # 12thman
2	Reading Undisputed by  @ IAmJericho and got to the auditions from the webisodes !  Hilarious reading it and picturing it in my head .   # truelife
2	On a better note ,  mad respect to  @ JohnCena for giving his wristband to the young man next to me decked out in Komen / Cena gear .   # madehisday
2	While Raw with  @ mcarp76 was decent ,  all I really wanted was for  @ CMPunk to wrestle . 
2	Guy in front of me said Curt Hennig was good .  Understatement of the decade .  Lets talk GREAT ,  if not PERFECT
2	Its not a Raw in OKC without  @ JRsBBQ and Boomer Sooner blasting through Chesapeake . 
2	 @ LanceStorm You made a commercial for the 20th anniversary of Raw on the Titantron in OKC .  You were being serious for a moment . 
2	 @ CamelClutchBlog Sadly ,  collecting dust .  Ill play it when all the DLC comes out ,  but its a shelver for now . 
2	I swear to everyone that  @ CMPunk and  @ WWEDanielBryan are a reincarnation of the Hart Foundation and the Road Warriors combined . 
2	 @ CMPunk and  @ WWEDanielBryan with a HART ATTACK ?  !  Best night ever
2	I want to thank  @ HEELZiggler for the J - E - Double F J - A - Double R - E - Double T strut and guitar shot tonight .  Incredible . 
2	As an OU and GU alum ,  Im pretty excited to see  @ kgzag and  @ sherricoale go head to head in the front row tonight ! 
2	Played 6 . 5 hours of  @ WWEgames last night .  Amazing .

2	 @ ShawnMichaels  # HBShizzle is brilliant .  BRILLIANT . 
2	First of many great wins from  @ OUHockey !  !  !  Cant wait for Game 2 tomorrow . 
2	I hate when I feel left out of stuff .  I know it isnt on purpose ,  but there are some things Id be interested in .   # idonothing
2	Im living in Norman 30 years too late .  This Mid - South DVD is incredible . 
2	PS4 officially preordered .  Gotta get useless things before my loans kick in . 
2	 @ marbraina oh ,  in that case ,  I came to OK with no parents .  Just David and  @ spokid
2	 @ marbraina My mom dropped Brett and myself off and said Good Luck .  Then his parents took care of us all year .  Hahah
2	 @ marbraina Listening to Wage Slaves and missing you ! 
2	So much frustration sometimes .  Cooler heads shall prevail . 
2	Spending my night with  @ ShawnMichaels Heartbreak and Triumph .  Great DVD set .  Makes me miss the Showstopper in the ring ! 
2	Nothing funnier than when in your own head ,  you can say  " I told you so "  . 
2	Periphery is awful . 
2	Periphery has too much going on with three guitars . 
2	Theres nothing greater than listening to ten different sound checks throughout the night . 
2	Norma Jean does what Norma Jean does perfectly
2	The feeling of being alone at a concert is not one that Im used to . 
2	I need to listen to more death metal
2	 @ Ckowzan I bet if you learned how to use power chords in your songs ,  theyd be brutal as fuck .  No dissonant chords either ! 
2	Havent seen Cattle Decap since the first Summer Slaughter .  .  .  Here we go
2	The Ocean is a great band .  .  .  But its not the type of music you see at these tours
2	I hope this hardcore dancing fool tries to dance during Cattle Decapitation .  Thatd be the end of him . 
2	Metal is the only time we Oklahomans can throw up the horns . 
2	Revocation is just straight sick nasty . 
2	Dismantle the Dictator was all I needed from Revocation . 
2	Re - vacation .  Brilliant . 
2	Revocation is ONLY  wearing speedos .   # metal
2	Revocation .  Yes !  Yes !  Yes ! 
2	Long curly hair is a prerequisite for those looking to wear jean vests . 
2	This just in .  Listen to Aeon . 
2	 @ Ckowzan This kid was droppin bows like he was Macho Man . 
2	Listen to death metal ?  No thank you .  Ill flail like a fish instead . 
2	From Rings of Shitty to a band with white guitars and long hair .  .  This could be good
2	 @ marbraina Ive been live tweeting Wrestlemania 3 .  DUH
2	Some of my old friends make me sad .  Show no concern over the world or our country .  Just themselves . 
2	Gonna live tweet some wrestling on my wrestling handle .   @ p2pc2c  # follow
2	 @ TheHistoryofWWE Got the Hogan / Flair combo .  The question is who is next for the WHC ?  Id assume Bret is next for WWF . 
2	 @ marbraina more meant those in the PNW !  You actually root for the Canes .  Im just blown away by the lack of Nucks support at home . 
2	How is it that no one has an NHL allegiance close to them ?  Its annoying having friends who are Devils and Rangers fans . 
2	Also ,  I remember when Hoopfest was about playing basketball ,  not drinking . 
2	Except the first album .  None of this 10 , 000 Fists crap . 
2	Let it be known that I hate Disturbed . 
2	 @ marbraina You should see the captions I send Cary in Snapchat .  Ridiculous . 
2	I keep thinking about deactivating my FB .  All the toxicity of it is too draining . 
2	 @ WWE Thank you for the War Games DVD .  It is perfect on every level . 
2	 @ WrestleChatNet I was every level of choked up .  How awesome was that though ?  Brilliance . 
2	 @ TheMarkHenry was brilliant .   # thatswhathedo  # raw
2	There should be a one child at a time haircut system .  Not all three of your children at once .   # thiswait
2	Aaaand Wilhelmsen blows it AGAIN .  Hes not gonna be closing the bar anymore .   # mariners
2	Three hours of MLB Tonight and they show two mins of the  @ Mariners game .  Go inside the park !  I cant watch the game on TV !   # struggle
2	I can tell  @ SoonerSoftball won because I can eat the fireworks from Traditions West !   # OneMoreToOKC
2	 @ AbbyHowe1 got charged for water .   # wtfSonic 
2	Nothing wrong with a major mark out moment when  @ HEELZiggler finally cashed in for that GOLD .   # showoff  # champ
2	My notebook for my comprehensive exam with  @ TheRock on it .  Reminds me that I need to  # justbringit and get my degree .  
2	 @ espn  @ SportsCenter 
2	 @ itsvadertime sighting on the new  @ BretHart DVD .  Love it !   # dungeoncollection

2	 @ WWERoadDogg A full decade after WCW closed shop ,  no one still wants Kidman .  
2	 @ ainsleyokeefe pitchers and catchers report in 8 days ! 
2	Did I get a scotch tonight ?  Damn right I did . 
2	Antonio Cesaro gets better every week at his Rougeau - esque gimmick . 
2	Took Daniel with my first pick in my draft !   @ VanCanucks  # Canucks  # DannySedin
2	I am so miserably sick of John Cena .   @ HEELZiggler deserved that win on Raw tonight .   # RAW20
2	The ladies had a fantastic match tonight .  I really like when the WWE gives them time to work instead of using then like a gimmick . 
2	Cannot believe there is such a world of prejudice out there today .  Disappoints me in our society . 
2	Atheist is not a dirty word .  We have the right to practice whatever we want .  No one should be shy about it anymore .  
2	There are times I wish I could read minds . 
2	Nothing better than a clean apartment and having a productive Saturday .  Laundry is almost done !   # trainingstartstomorrow
2	Django Unchained was exactly the movie I thought it would be .  Tarantino continues to be my favorite . 
2	I always find it funny when a person says that a newer movie is their favorite movie .  Have you seen no others ? 
2	Sometimes I wonder how a small group of people can be so loud .   # donotmakeknockagain
2	 @ DJ _ View Did you see this ?  
2	Glad to see  @ ZackRyder get some air time tonight !   # wwwyki
2	So many possibilities for the fantasy playoffs .  Get ready for tomorrow  @ berchina  @ alyssaloveless  @ TheRealRodB Yall are still in the hunt ! 
2	Cousins to Clark Oop for the  @ Sooners !   # SCTop10
2	 @ berchina  @ lydi _ gaga Are you kidding me ?   # philisms

2	11AM kickoff in Ft .  Worth next week ?  Thats an early morning road trip !   # BeatTCU
2	I bet every referee watching elsewhere is just as pissed about that  " pass interference "  .   # givethemthegamewhydontyou
2	85 , 000 people and we couldnt force a false start if we tried .   # seahawksgetitright
2	Can we get Bradford some eligibility for the rest of this game ? 
2	 @ DJ _ View I have a video on my phone of  @ berchina attempting to rap .  Remind me to show you on Monday . 
2	 @  _ EMaloney Happy thanksgiving ,  favorite OA ! 
2	 @  _ EMaloney Almost fucked up hard ! 
2	 @ marbraina Its cool .  You got tea ,  I got beer . 
2	 @ marbraina So rude . 
2	 @ LAURENsamone I just took my first Wickle in honor of you !  I hope you are feeling better .   # youareawesome
2	 @ berchina just found out Hostess is going out of business .  Shes having a panic attack .   # cupcakes  # snoballs  # dingdongs  # twinkies
2	These  @ BlueJays are gonna be ridiculous this year .  First ,  the big trade .  Second ,  Melky .  Hopefully  @ 2Morrow23 has a HUGE year . 
2	This whole week is a  # BeatWVU week ,  starting tonight .   # ZagUp  # boomersooner
2	 @ JCBaumCom I like the hashtag .  Im using it for the Gonzaga and WVU game tonight .  It will extend past football .   :  ) 
2	 @ deejaykae Creepiest guy ever ! 
2	 @ lydi _ gaga Sometimes I watch football ,  eat pizza ,  and drink Starbucks all day .  Sorry Im not sorry . 
2	So happy Bama lost .  .  .  Cant wait for KSU and ND in the title game and a Fiesta Bowl for the Sooners ! 
2	I really think that a lot of people would rather stay ignorant than accept all of the things going on around us .  Learn about the world ! 
2	Goal by June :  Get rid of as much credit card debt as I can and be driving in a new car .   # realworld
2	 @ Ambitious _ 14 Especially if Imma see Lincoln next week ! 
2	 @ Ambitious _ 14 Im a nerd when it comes to video game stuff .  Plus I only have money for one ! 
2	 @ Ambitious _ 14 I know  @ BenjaminBechle really want to see Skyfall .  Id go ,  but Im going to see Wreck It Ralph ! 
2	The  @ Mariners are already linked to  @ thejoshhamilton all over Twitter .  Interesting as a fan .   # poweratsafeco
2	 "  @ Marlins :  BREAKING :  The Miami  # Marlins name Tino Martinez hitting coach .  "   @ berchina Dammit .  I didnt wanna like Miami .  Now I have to . 
2	I miss Tent City !   # alumnilife  "  @ kcboard :  Tent city is baaaack .  Who else cant wait to camp out on Sunday night for WVU ?  " 
2	Sometimes I just want to intern with a GM in baseball .  Doesnt matter who .  I have ideas that could help a team out !

2	 @ R _ Roddy _ Piper HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH .  Best joke of the day ! 
2	 @ honorbrightxoxo What an awesome blog post ,  Erikah .  Glad you are staying so open - minded about politics .   :  ) 
2	I am proud to say that I voted for same sex marriage in Washington .  It looks as if it will pass .   # fingerscrossedforequality
2	Stopped reading to listen to Romney .  Kind of wonder where that Mitt was throughout the election .  Would have made it more interesting . 
2	 @ spokid And of course ,  to each their own .  I like Maddow and you dont .  Doesnt bother me any !   # friendship
2	 @ spokid I would actually love to hear JGL report on Fox News going crazy for 20 mins after the election was called .  He would do it so well . 
2	 @ TherealRVD Washington State legalized it too ! 
2	I love  @ maddow .  Calling out Fox News as she should . 
2	Really hoping that these Washington State votes come through for the referendums . 
2	Todd Akin :  Not everyone believes in God ,  or even your God .  You lost .  Get over it . 
2	Washington ,  Oregon ,  California ,  Iowa ,  and a battleground state wins it for Obama !   # fourmoreyears
2	After voting in Washington this year ,  I will be voting in Oklahoma from now on .  Disappointed in some of the legislature here in OK . 
2	 @ DJ _ View At least you dont look trashy like I do so far . 
2	 @ deejaykae Thats what Im saying .  Have you seen the list of his accomplishments since he has been in office ? 
2	The concept of the library as a place to study is to be quiet .  Dearest sorority girls behind us .  .  .  Shut up . 
2	 @ AbbyHowe1  @ XineWess I caved and bought Phase 10 . 
2	Sooner Mall really brings the best people out of their homes . 
2	 @ scarletoak Absolutely I do .  Ill buy it with my first real paycheck ! 
2	 @ alyssaloveless We have a scholarship kicker coming in next year .  Dont you worry ! 
2	Landry .  .  .  not wearing the red jerseys today .  WTH . 
2	Three days in and my face itches .  Itll take another week to stop that .   # noshavenovember
2	 @ JCBaumCom Thats what Im saying !  Just like the Cards need the powder blues every now and then .
