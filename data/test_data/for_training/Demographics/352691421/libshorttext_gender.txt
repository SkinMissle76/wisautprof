-1	While Raw with  @ mcarp76 was decent ,  all I really wanted was for  @ CMPunk to wrestle . 
-1	Guy in front of me said Curt Hennig was good .  Understatement of the decade .  Lets talk GREAT ,  if not PERFECT
-1	Its not a Raw in OKC without  @ JRsBBQ and Boomer Sooner blasting through Chesapeake . 
-1	 @ LanceStorm You made a commercial for the 20th anniversary of Raw on the Titantron in OKC .  You were being serious for a moment .

-1	 @ marbraina oh ,  in that case ,  I came to OK with no parents .  Just David and  @ spokid
-1	 @ marbraina My mom dropped Brett and myself off and said Good Luck .  Then his parents took care of us all year .  Hahah
-1	 @ marbraina Listening to Wage Slaves and missing you ! 
-1	So much frustration sometimes .  Cooler heads shall prevail . 
-1	Spending my night with  @ ShawnMichaels Heartbreak and Triumph .  Great DVD set .  Makes me miss the Showstopper in the ring ! 
-1	Nothing funnier than when in your own head ,  you can say  " I told you so "  . 
-1	Periphery is awful . 
-1	Periphery has too much going on with three guitars . 
-1	Theres nothing greater than listening to ten different sound checks throughout the night . 
-1	Norma Jean does what Norma Jean does perfectly
-1	The feeling of being alone at a concert is not one that Im used to . 
-1	I need to listen to more death metal
-1	 @ Ckowzan I bet if you learned how to use power chords in your songs ,  theyd be brutal as fuck .  No dissonant chords either ! 
-1	Havent seen Cattle Decap since the first Summer Slaughter .  .  .  Here we go
-1	The Ocean is a great band .  .  .  But its not the type of music you see at these tours
-1	I hope this hardcore dancing fool tries to dance during Cattle Decapitation .  Thatd be the end of him . 
-1	Metal is the only time we Oklahomans can throw up the horns . 
-1	Revocation is just straight sick nasty . 
-1	Dismantle the Dictator was all I needed from Revocation . 
-1	Re - vacation .  Brilliant . 
-1	Revocation is ONLY  wearing speedos .   # metal
-1	Revocation .  Yes !  Yes !  Yes ! 
-1	Long curly hair is a prerequisite for those looking to wear jean vests . 
-1	This just in .  Listen to Aeon . 
-1	 @ Ckowzan This kid was droppin bows like he was Macho Man . 
-1	Listen to death metal ?  No thank you .  Ill flail like a fish instead . 
-1	From Rings of Shitty to a band with white guitars and long hair .  .  This could be good
-1	 @ marbraina Ive been live tweeting Wrestlemania 3 .  DUH
-1	Some of my old friends make me sad .  Show no concern over the world or our country .  Just themselves . 
-1	Gonna live tweet some wrestling on my wrestling handle .   @ p2pc2c  # follow
-1	 @ TheHistoryofWWE Got the Hogan / Flair combo .  The question is who is next for the WHC ?  Id assume Bret is next for WWF . 
-1	 @ marbraina more meant those in the PNW !  You actually root for the Canes .  Im just blown away by the lack of Nucks support at home . 
-1	How is it that no one has an NHL allegiance close to them ?  Its annoying having friends who are Devils and Rangers fans . 
-1	Also ,  I remember when Hoopfest was about playing basketball ,  not drinking . 
-1	Except the first album .  None of this 10 , 000 Fists crap . 
-1	Let it be known that I hate Disturbed . 
-1	 @ marbraina You should see the captions I send Cary in Snapchat .  Ridiculous . 
-1	I keep thinking about deactivating my FB .  All the toxicity of it is too draining . 
-1	 @ WWE Thank you for the War Games DVD .  It is perfect on every level . 
-1	 @ WrestleChatNet I was every level of choked up .  How awesome was that though ?  Brilliance . 
-1	 @ TheMarkHenry was brilliant .   # thatswhathedo  # raw

-1	Took Daniel with my first pick in my draft !   @ VanCanucks  # Canucks  # DannySedin
-1	I am so miserably sick of John Cena .   @ HEELZiggler deserved that win on Raw tonight .   # RAW20
-1	The ladies had a fantastic match tonight .  I really like when the WWE gives them time to work instead of using then like a gimmick . 
-1	Cannot believe there is such a world of prejudice out there today .  Disappoints me in our society . 
-1	Atheist is not a dirty word .  We have the right to practice whatever we want .  No one should be shy about it anymore .  
-1	There are times I wish I could read minds . 
-1	Nothing better than a clean apartment and having a productive Saturday .  Laundry is almost done !   # trainingstartstomorrow
-1	Django Unchained was exactly the movie I thought it would be .  Tarantino continues to be my favorite . 
-1	I always find it funny when a person says that a newer movie is their favorite movie .  Have you seen no others ? 
-1	Sometimes I wonder how a small group of people can be so loud .   # donotmakeknockagain
-1	 @ DJ _ View Did you see this ?  
-1	Glad to see  @ ZackRyder get some air time tonight !   # wwwyki

-1	I really think that a lot of people would rather stay ignorant than accept all of the things going on around us .  Learn about the world ! 
-1	Goal by June :  Get rid of as much credit card debt as I can and be driving in a new car .   # realworld

-1	Stopped reading to listen to Romney .  Kind of wonder where that Mitt was throughout the election .  Would have made it more interesting . 
-1	 @ spokid And of course ,  to each their own .  I like Maddow and you dont .  Doesnt bother me any !   # friendship
-1	 @ spokid I would actually love to hear JGL report on Fox News going crazy for 20 mins after the election was called .  He would do it so well . 
-1	 @ TherealRVD Washington State legalized it too ! 
-1	I love  @ maddow .  Calling out Fox News as she should . 
-1	Really hoping that these Washington State votes come through for the referendums . 
-1	Todd Akin :  Not everyone believes in God ,  or even your God .  You lost .  Get over it . 
-1	Washington ,  Oregon ,  California ,  Iowa ,  and a battleground state wins it for Obama !   # fourmoreyears
-1	After voting in Washington this year ,  I will be voting in Oklahoma from now on .  Disappointed in some of the legislature here in OK .
