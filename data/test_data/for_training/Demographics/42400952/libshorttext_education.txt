2	 @ WWE  # basic - thuganomics .  John Cena at his best .  .  .  YET AGAIN !  Great way to kick off  # Raw
2	 @ WWE  # Cenation Was never a huge Cena fan ,  but he always has my respect !  WM28 itll be Cena putting his boot to Dwaynes ass ! 
2	 @ WWE  # raw Dont know if anyone noticed but Daniel Bryan was still the legal man ,  not Y2J .  Illegal pinfall !  Therefore Punk is  # BestInTheWorld

2	 @ WWE  # wwenoc WooWooWoo !  !  ! 
2	 @ bisping So many people seem to not like you and i think its so ridiculous ,  especially when they discount your talent !  Future champion ! 
2	 @ Rampage4real The title is coming home in 9 days !  A champion with a personality again !  Slam him through the cage if he gives you the chance !
