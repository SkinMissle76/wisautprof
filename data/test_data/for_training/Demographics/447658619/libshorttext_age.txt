-0.4	Isnt there a major flaw with this site ?  It assumes Labour would actually finish building the thing
-0.4	 # Cricket9  # AusvWI remember when commentators used to be impartial ,  rather than just Oz barrackers like they are now ? 
-0.4	 @ ningbojoe Yes ,  of course ,  Gillard / Labour would never lie about a carbon tax  .   .   .  er  . Not sure thats your best angle

-0.4	 @ GhostOfPJK I thought hed be more upset about the Home  & amp ;  Away comparison for some reason
-0.4	 # AUSvWI  # Cricket9 you can see why Indians dont like DRS .  Still looks arbitrary . 
-0.4	 # auspol anyone notice politicians are like Italian footballers .  Always pretending theyre more hurt than they actually are .  Man up FFS

-0.4	 @ byrnedean1 A choice that should be punished according to your article .   " Shouldnâ€™t those words be inappropriate in ANY context ?  "  you said . 
-0.4	 @ byrnedean1 if the words are unacceptable in  " any context "  ,  I assume Garth Crooks  (  +  the judge and the bbc )  are also guilty ? 
-0.4	If Garth Crooks says cannot use those words ,  in any context ,  why does he use them in his article ?   # johnterry
-0.4	 @ NatashaSHenry If those words should never be used ,  no matter what the context ,  then why did you use them in your article ?

-0.4	 @ piersmorgan maybe JTs innocent ? 
-0.4	 # Cricket9 delayed telecast in Perth ,  3  &  1 / 2 hours .  On foxtel ,  2 hours  &  in high def .  Thats 1  &  1 / 2 half less bullshit  &  ads . 
-0.4	 @ JasonRoberts30 It has not affected the Chelsea dressing room  &  there are more black players in there .  Probably due to his innocence ?  ! 
-0.4	Bad luck tonight scorchers ,  but well done making  &  hosting final .  Well done Sixers  &  good luck to both in  $  $  $  league  # getscorched  # Bigbash

-0.4	Those test rankings looking right on the money 1 England 2 India  ?  !  ?  # cricket  # abcgrandstand
-0.4	Of the course the big question now is how much of a lead Dhoni feels that he needs ,  before he can declare ?   # Cricket9  # ausvind  # wwos9
-0.4	I love a good contest between bat and ball  # Cricket9  # AusvInd  # wwos9
-0.4	 # getscorched best get Hayden shortly ,  else its all over ,  red rover
-0.4	Still not much talk about Haddins LBW !  Could it be the lack of avail hawk eye ,  actually validates Indias concern over DRS ?  !  ?   # wwos9
