-1	 # Ashes Wow !  !  Does Haddin really need to cheat now ? 
-1	 @ manthatcooks Long ( ish )  lunch .  Thought Id tweet to help out the poor old coalition .  You know ,  tough times  & amp ;  all that . 
-1	Isnt there a major flaw with this site ?  It assumes Labour would actually finish building the thing
-1	 # Cricket9  # AusvWI remember when commentators used to be impartial ,  rather than just Oz barrackers like they are now ? 
-1	 @ ningbojoe Yes ,  of course ,  Gillard / Labour would never lie about a carbon tax  .   .   .  er  . Not sure thats your best angle
-1	 @ SirBobMenzies  # ratssinkingship
-1	 @ 0ccupyGoldCoast  @ mrdenmore Shit yes !  !  ! Am counting down the days
-1	 @ markjs1  " libturd "  !  ?  Classy
-1	 @ GhostOfPJK I thought hed be more upset about the Home  & amp ;  Away comparison for some reason
-1	 # AUSvWI  # Cricket9 you can see why Indians dont like DRS .  Still looks arbitrary . 
-1	 # auspol anyone notice politicians are like Italian footballers .  Always pretending theyre more hurt than they actually are .  Man up FFS
-1	 @ anotherowski what about the abc ? Theyre pretty left wing .  Dont they help ? 
-1	 @ ningbojoe what ?  ,  same goes for Dreyfus and his  " Shades of Goebbels "  article then ? But hes just been made AG !  ?  ! 
-1	 @ AshleyLeahy  @ murr1960 brilliant !  !  # hypocrisy  # potkettleblack
-1	 # Cricket9 now sunk to new low .  Now showings ads ,  mid over .  Please foxtel ,  get the cricket off nine . 
-1	 # getscorched  # bigbash Get your pads ready Murali
-1	 @ manthatcooks Right ,  Ive now switched from synchronized swimming  & amp ;  facebook to BMX  & amp ;  twitter
-1	Based on number of silver medals won ,  Aussies are forth . Get in !  ! 
-1	 @ byrnedean1 A choice that should be punished according to your article .   " Shouldnâ€™t those words be inappropriate in ANY context ?  "  you said . 
-1	 @ byrnedean1 if the words are unacceptable in  " any context "  ,  I assume Garth Crooks  (  +  the judge and the bbc )  are also guilty ? 
-1	If Garth Crooks says cannot use those words ,  in any context ,  why does he use them in his article ?   # johnterry
-1	 @ NatashaSHenry If those words should never be used ,  no matter what the context ,  then why did you use them in your article ? 
-1	thanks  @ manthatcooks ,  my bind  =  & gt ;  blown
-1	 @ piersmorgan maybe JTs innocent ? 
-1	 # Cricket9 delayed telecast in Perth ,  3  &  1 / 2 hours .  On foxtel ,  2 hours  &  in high def .  Thats 1  &  1 / 2 half less bullshit  &  ads . 
-1	 @ JasonRoberts30 It has not affected the Chelsea dressing room  &  there are more black players in there .  Probably due to his innocence ?  ! 
-1	Bad luck tonight scorchers ,  but well done making  &  hosting final .  Well done Sixers  &  good luck to both in  $  $  $  league  # getscorched  # Bigbash
-1	 @ MitchellGlenn Ponting  &  Clarke opened ? 
-1	2 worst national  anthems  # ausvind
-1	Never thought Id see Warne bowling to Gibbs and / or Collingwood at the WACA again  # getscorched
-1	Those test rankings looking right on the money 1 England 2 India  ?  !  ?  # cricket  # abcgrandstand
-1	Of the course the big question now is how much of a lead Dhoni feels that he needs ,  before he can declare ?   # Cricket9  # ausvind  # wwos9
-1	I love a good contest between bat and ball  # Cricket9  # AusvInd  # wwos9
-1	 # getscorched best get Hayden shortly ,  else its all over ,  red rover
-1	Still not much talk about Haddins LBW !  Could it be the lack of avail hawk eye ,  actually validates Indias concern over DRS ?  !  ?   # wwos9
