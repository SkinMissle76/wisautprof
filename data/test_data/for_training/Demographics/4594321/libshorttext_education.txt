2	 ( In a world where I have babies ,  my boys are dressed in pink and I laugh at ppl who say I cant ) 
2	I have some lovely yarn here ,  but most of it is either boy or girl when put on a baby .  And its not my kid ,  so not my fight / standards .  .  . 
2	Whilst I massively respect the choice of parents - to - be not knowing boy / girl ,  is arse to knit for .  Also ,  societal expectations of colour suck
2	Look !  Sarah and James got Emo ribbons !

2	 @ angusprune  ( and yeah ,  I dont either ,  but I just scrolled through the public tweets and nothing ) 
2	 @ angusprune it looks suspiciously like a trolling hashtag ,  theres no blog links ,  no tweets with content other than outrage .  .  . 
2	 @ angusprune I cant actually see where / why that originates ,  just lots of anger about it .  .  .   ? 
2	O just threw food at me  ( as requested )  ,  Emo chased it across the room and now wants to play .  .  .  he may as well have a wagging tail  # CatOrDog

2	 @ andrewfergusson  @ jaysteruk or we could have matching briefcases ,  and  " oh no !  I got the wrong one !  " 
2	 ( it might just be me ,  tbh .  .  .   ) 
2	That thing ,  where you accidentally buy a new macbook ,  and have to set up dodgy sounding meet ups with  @ jaysteruk and  @ andrewfergusson  .  .  ? 
2	 @ Suw  ( it is my rejects though ,  so dont get  * too *  excited  ;  )

2	Btw ,  2014 Im hoping to get my stash down .  Shortly I will photo the yarn I want to get rid of .  If you fancy something in it ,  let me know

2	NERDS !  I need new - laptop advice :  
2	 @ buttonista Ive found that the lack of drying soap means frizz isnt an issue now  ( plus Im lazy ,  and this is quicker / easier !  ) 
2	 @ notanodalisque so ,  yeah ,  not exactly wasteful extravagance ! 
2	 @ notanodalisque our sales spending is likely to be a new mattress and laptop ,  which I need for work  ( to replace my now dead one )  . 
2	 @ buttonista  ( oh ,  and after 2 - 3 months ,  my hair is thicker / healthier ,  with so little effort )   # Evangelical

2	 @ Ewan it was more the hassle ,  for 4 minutes .   ( next film isnt on netflix ,  just looked .  It promises to be bad ,  but sci - fi ,  so good / bad ) 
2	Im comforting myself with the idea that they fall to their death at the end and drown / die in a fire .  That helps slightly
2	 @ Ewan nargh ,  that wants me to install stuff  ( I dont think the other film is on Netflix ) 
2	 @ Ewan I had never seen it ,  and for some unknown reason O loves it .  Another film starts at 9

2	 @ angusprune  @ LadyoftheCanyon there are 3 levels ,  graded in a similar way to school years / video ratings .  Most strict is only 1 being reported
2	 @ angusprune  @ LadyoftheCanyon no indeed ,  which is why O2 / etc offer this
2	 @ LadyoftheCanyon when the options are  " scared of it so no internet "  or  " some U rated content "  ,  this is a non - issue
2	 @ LadyoftheCanyon but things like NetNanny act as opt - in .  What O2 are offering parents isnt new / unusual ,  and its not  " bad "
