40	Poor Moyes .  Subpar players buoyed along by the greatest manager of a generation and hes left to pick up the pieces .   # bbcfootball
40	 @ notonlyahatrack I would just like him to slide back into the mud from whence he came and not bother us again . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 I have no clue .  I know its cliche for football fans to think their teams being victimised ,  but come on .  .  . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 looks like hes going to be investigated for it though ,  David Bernstein said as much .  . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 the thing is ,  he only did  " 2 - 0 "  because the Spurs fans were chanting  " let him die "  and throwing the coins ! 
40	It is still astounding to me that the main story from yesterdays game is Theos gesture and not the rain of coins that started it all .  .  . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 the boys a monster .  Hopefully we can keep a hold of him . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 hopefully some more youngsters will get a run out ,  Gnabry again ,  Zelalem and Bellerin .  . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 nah ,  just lie down and take it please ! 
40	 @ skybluesam86 I very much look forward to it . 
40	 @ Perfection7 heh that was funny .  i liked how his ended up though , 
40	 @ Perfection7 that the bald dude ? 
40	Best Take Me Out couple ever . 
40	 @ skybluesam86 shocker .  Commentators made nothing of it but you know if it was Jack everyone would be up in arms . 
40	 @ Ashleychittock hes gonna be brilliant ,  for sure . 
40	Retrospective action please ,  FA . 
40	 @ Ashleychittock better him than empty space ,  I suppose .  Would rather him there than Poldi at the mo . 
40	 @ Ashleychittock hes been alright .  Never has his best games up front though . 
40	 @ Ashleychittock gotta admit its pretty funny .

40	 @ SF1034 They were in the Europa League a couple of seasons ago ,  when they dropped out of the CL .  finishing 7th would be great ,  though . 
40	 @ SF1034 I reckon your not being in Europe this year is a main reason for you doing so well in the league .  .  blessing in disguise ! 
40	 @ SF1034 at least you avenged your defeat to hull today ,  eh ? 
40	 @ SF1034 hehe ,  unfortunately its points that count and youre a few behind on those ! 
40	THEEEEEO ! 
40	For fucks sake Nicklas ,  just our luck . 
40	 @ MBJordan arent i ,  though ?  !  No problem .  Dont break it .   ;  ) 
40	 @ MBJordan hmm ,  that looks like part of the design .  .  Why dont you look up a pic of your model online and see if the box is there ? 
40	 @ MBJordan I dont think mine came with a plastic box .  .  What does it look like ? 
40	 @ MBJordan the what now ?  Where is this light ?  Not sure its on my model .  . 
40	 @ heatherdawn _ xo yeah ,  I really enjoyed it too .  The 50th anniversary was great too ! 
40	 @ heatherdawn _ xo I havent seen any of the last season yet !  Lots of catching up to do
40	 @ heatherdawn _ xo have a great one !  But dont get your hopes up ,  2014 is pretty similar so far !  xx

40	 @ notonlyahatrack hang on ,  wrong league ,  Im a bellend
40	 @ notonlyahatrack Ive put in BJGE and Eric Decker for Martin and Cruz .  Looks good on my end .  .  If you dont see it can you change it for me ? 
40	 @ notonlyahatrack all done mate .  Thanks for reminding  me ,  I didnt even realise it was Sunday ! 
40	 @ notonlyahatrack I cant even remember my login .  This could end badly .  What site was the league on ?  Bet Im logging in to the wrong one

40	 @ Swagadore  @ LandOfOzil draw please
40	 @ Perfection7 its a call that a professional linesman should be getting right .  It wasnt mega close
40	 @ Perfection7 he has a better view ,  looking directly down the line of the defence .  .  . 
40	 @ Perfection7 even in real time I was able to tell he was onside .  Lino gets paid to make those decisions and should have got that right
40	 @ Perfection7 did you not see the freeze frame where he was very very clearly onside ?  My bad tho ,  got Sterling and Sturridge mixed up
40	 @ Perfection7 not sure what youre watching ,  anyway . 
40	 @ Perfection7 hardly an easy mistake when Sturridge was a yard and a half onside .  .  .

40	I do not understand how that is not a penalty .  Fuck you ,  Dean  # afc
40	 @ willbuxton  @ scottritchie8 betfred said it was a fake ,  unfortunately !

40	 @ LadyArse thats science ,  that is . 
40	 @ Swagadore good job youve got enough midfielders to make up for it then
40	 @ MBJordan we went at 6am yesterday and it was busy then ,  cant even imagine what its like now .  .  .

40	 @ toomuchracing  @ onthelimitblog v good point ,  but its all about numbers for  # spoty .  5 min motogp seg and many will turn off . 
40	 @ toomuchracing  @ onthelimitblog  # spoty is the distilled essence of mainstream sports media ,  though .  Theyll only go for the  * most *  popular . 
40	 @ toomuchracing  @ onthelimitblog not strictly true ,  motogp gets not infrequent mentions .  .  . 
40	 @ IndycarUK  @ onthelimitblog That ,  and being a participant in a sport that doesnt have a wide audience here .  Not much on Brit NFLers either .  .
