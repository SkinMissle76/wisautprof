2	 @ dskolnick Jets and Browns are similar franchises ,  mostly proving themselves inept at winning games that matter .  At least you have the Gmen . 
2	 @ dskolnick The always improving 5 - 7 Browns .   We should have known the Jets were going to get exposed after Browns gave them an unearned win . 
2	 @ dskolnick I am .  That would mean this account only sends what needs to be said .  Im guessing you enjoy the necessary emails a bit more ?
