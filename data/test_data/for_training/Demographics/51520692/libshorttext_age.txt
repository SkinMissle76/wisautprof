-0.54	 @ JamesCampion10  @ Phipps15 who the hell would nick that ?  ! 
-0.54	 @ LewDev9 Shouldnt get sacked even if you finish 17th .  Write the season off and let him rebuild in summer .  Lack of quality players . 
-0.54	This serves West Ham right for playing such a weakened team .  Respect the FA cup . 
-0.54	 @ ArgosHelpers  @ KaineRigbyPT I need to do the same .  Can you follow so I can DM please . 
-0.54	Luton should have had this game called off ,  horrendous scenes !  That pitch will be ruined for rest of season now . 
-0.54	Well thats our season over then .  .   # 1manteam
-0.54	Negredo loves an outside of the foot . 
-0.54	Giroud trying his best not to score . 
-0.54	 @  _ JW7 _  So happy Im off work for Xmas ! 
-0.54	 @ J _ lucas _ 89 Ah shit yeah forgot about him !  Lets hope he is back from injury in time and we have a serious chance ! 
-0.54	Suarez is just something else .  If he doesnt get injured before the world cup ,  then he alone will kill us . 
-0.54	5 - 0 Liverpool .  Suarez 2 goals ,  3 assists .  Too good ! 
-0.54	This is going to be messy for Villa
-0.54	What a win that is for the Dons !   # mkdons  # wolves
-0.54	Finished Breaking Bad .  Now what to do !  ? 
-0.54	Wigan away .  Never have any luck with the draw !  Boring
-0.54	 @ tomcampion1 haha he might have a good song but he aint better than Hazard
-0.54	Good decision captaining Suarez in my Fantasy Football team . 
-0.54	 @ Jisan _ Miah Same haha so good
-0.54	Hazard is unreal .  Best player in the prem ? 
-0.54	 @ FirstCC Why was this not on board at station though ?  I drove home for no reason and have now missed it !  Only displayed on website
-0.54	 @ FirstCC Since when was there a train from Biggleswade to LKC at 07 : 25 ?  Why was this not on the board at station after 07 : 07 was cancelled ? 
-0.54	 @ RichardMarvell1 Haha couldnt have chosen a better club to finish his career at !  Still ugly though
-0.54	 @ JamesCampion10  @ AndreGee1 haha so sick if true
-0.54	 @ Liam _ R _ McKenna Yeah not bad at all .  Lallana needs to improve his corners though . 
-0.54	Eminem ft .  Nate Ruess  -  Headlights .  Thisll be number 1 in a few weeks .  Tune . 
-0.54	 @ JamesCampion10

-0.54	Would love MK to draw Biggleswade away !  Easiest away day commute Id ever have ! 
-0.54	 @ AdamBrewster1 Arteta was still last man though .  Cham only had to run through to goal with a team mate along side him .  Koschielny no chance
-0.54	 @ AdamBrewster1 Hes right though .  Red was correct decision
-0.54	Just seen Wilsheres goal .  Incredible ! 
-0.54	 @ raffers10 Starting watching it yesterday myself .  Done 4 episodes so far .  Made for a pretty disrupted day at work . 
-0.54	 @ LewDev9 overrated ! 
-0.54	Dropping Lampard for Carrick was a mistake . 
-0.54	Why have the FA given them 18 , 000 tickets ?  !  Morons
-0.54	 @ raffers10 Fuming .  One of them gets 60k a year in benefits and is being moved into a brand new 500k house .

-0.54	 @ J _ lucas _ 89 Ahh decent !  Not long till youll be getting into League 2 footy . 
-0.54	 @ J _ lucas _ 89 Haha his looks have improved .  .  . slightly .  Top player for MK though . 
-0.54	What is it about Milner ?  How does he always manage to get on the pitch at some point ?  ! 
-0.54	MK Dons made Andros Towsend . 
-0.54	Why are people surprised to see Townsend in the starting line up ?  Have they not watched any prem games this season ? 
-0.54	Pretty tempted to put a bet on Belgium reach the WC final .  .  .  Such a strong team . 
-0.54	Townsend is top class .  Deserves to start ,  always a threat . 
-0.54	The Simpsons are killing off a main character  : o Bart ?

-0.54	 @ AndyBarker69  @ FirstCC Haha ,  the 19 : 33 is too bloody late !  Cant argue with that ,  the first thing I do is work out my quickest way home ! 
-0.54	 @ FirstCC Your website now says that theres a train at 15 : 35 ,  then not one until 19 : 33 .  Please explain ?  Some of us need to get home from work
-0.54	 @ FirstCC Then why on your website does it say itll take 27 minutes ? 
-0.54	 @ FirstCC 18 : 23 amended timetable from Kings Cross to Biggleswade ,  is that direct to Bwade ?  Or slow train ?

-0.54	Apparently 15yr old drowned in Biggs earlier ,  guess that explains the helicopters !  2 deaths in a month ! 
-0.54	 @  _ stevie _ black _  Cannot tell if this is sarcasm or not haha
-0.54	 @  _ stevie _ black _  Well ,  Galloway was playing LB and didnt give him a sniff ,  so i would assume so ? 
-0.54	 @  _ stevie _ black _  Brendon Galloway you mean ? 
-0.54	 @ Jisan _ Miah Both were pens but red card was harsh .
