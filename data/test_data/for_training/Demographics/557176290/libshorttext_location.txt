16	 @ CitizenDCharles Thought Id have an easy day at work today and desk DC style today

16	 @ missjojangles After every  # lbloggers chat ,  I shake my head at my own lack of organisation
16	Decided to wear suede shoes during  # UKStorm  & amp ;  yes of course theyre heels ,  because why only be half stupid when you can be totally idiotic
16	 @ MonicaBeatrice This makes me want to curl up in one of my giant jumpers with my puppy and a cuppa  # snug

16	 @ indiarose737 all furd up  # Ascot 
16	Its as I feared :  Im living ,  breathing and eating iPhone 5s ,  everything apart from sleeping apparently .  Like a child with a new toy . 
16	New Years resolution is to be a complete bore .  That way ,  I may progress with much else .  Farewell dramas ,  youve been interesting ,  til 2015
16	 @ JonnyWhiley I cant believe I used to dislike the series at first .  I clearly wasnt thinking straight
16	On a scale of 1 - 10 ,  how strange is it to crack out portable straighteners on the train ? 
16	24 hours until 2014 ,  the year of the well behaved ðŸ˜‡ unless I happen to stumble across Aragorn .  Resolution momentarily paused .

16	 @ careytompsett  @ Thisisglos Ive found my perfect Ascot bet .  
16	 @ 133Noble _ Bey I think you cant generalise which is why its better to write from personal experience ,  that way youre your own case study ! 
16	When youre healthy eating ,  its like your senses are doubly strong ,  the smell of food is everywhere and its like I CAN TASTE IT
16	Lucky us ,  beautifully cute apartment overlooking Covent Garden  # london  # love

16	 @ missjojangles That reminds me I need to book the Harry Potter studios tour soon ,  never too old for that  # lbloggers
16	Sometimes ,  it feels like the whole universe is watching either Strictly or X Factor and watching neither makes you a strange little alien . 
16	Writing about Sherlock and shopping ,  a Friday morning win if Ive ever seen one . 
16	 @ GlosEcho  # celebselfie with Tim Vine  -  his idea 
16	 @ CitizenDCharles I dont mean advice on the topic of women ,  alcohol and parties haaa .  Im back in ,  was on lunch  # tragic

16	 # MoMA  # London 
16	 @ shriankakalia Best friend actually ,  kahi bhi mujhe acche larka nahi milthe ðŸ˜­
16	No amount of wishful thinking is turning this Sunday into Saturday .  One more recovery day is needed . 
16	Suffering from impatience on post - party day :  waiting in queues for tube ,  toilets ,  coffee ,  ticket buying ,  EVERYTHING is driving me mad . 
16	 # SherlockLives
16	Made a wise decision :  opted for classy shoes and dress for work do ,  farewell short shorts ,  hello elegance .  
16	 @ AM201321 Aran we cant be friends until I get my straighteners back .  Please sort . 
16	 @ MarkHalliwell1  @ willdoney Great thing about London is someone is always doing something stranger
16	The sort of thing father Joshi puts on your table when you say youre healthy eating  # pureevil  # temptation 
16	No words can describe how much I love Aragorn ,  he will always be number one . 
16	 @ 133Noble _ Bey Interesting point ,  maybe everyone wants a well articulated person these days even if it is unrealistic
16	What do you do ?  I work in digital branding doing marketing ,  executive for social media ETCJob titles have got so boring these days . 
16	After all the aftershave counter stress ,  get home to find brothers bought the same for dad .  Im so done with Xmas  # scrooge
16	Demolished a lot of  @ wishbonebrixton food and drinks menu ,  would recommend it . 
16	Came in to an empty editorial department and its like some weird ,  spooky universe . 
16	Ascot time .  
16	 @ forgedinfables Mind you ,  a cuppa in the morning works an absolute wonder for a latte - holic like myself !  Im lucky though ,  its adorable ðŸ˜Š
16	Watching Coco Before Chanel .  The most courageous act is to think for yourself .  Aloud . 
16	Perfect day off :  brunch ,  shopping and now for Bevos bday partyyy 
16	 @ shriankakalia Just reevaluating whether Im on track in life ,  as you do this time of night haha !  We have to go for another coffee sooon
16	 @ WannabeDG Regretting the decision ,  it was like a war between crazed shoppers
16	Public transport is such a disappointment  # hurryupbus
16	I have just discovered that somebody has been on my phone and switched my contacts around .  I will find you .  Much like Liam Neeson in Taken . 
16	When I worked in retail :  couldnt understand why people would shop on Boxing Day .  Now I dont work in retail :  still think the same
16	 @ zoebowx It does seem like a laugh ,  I remember when I first watched  @ JennaMarbles and I thought she was so funny ,  genius
16	 @ BKingsmill Need to put my taste buds to the test in that case ! 
16	 # TweetYourUnpopularOpinion Mint ice - cream is like cold ,  liquidised toothpaste  # vom
16	 @ liammckinnon Shooters ,  because theyre a sophisticated ,  members only kinda bar .  .  . OH WAIT .  I was not impressed at all .

16	Getting festive and heading to the Christmas Market later for mulled wine and all things warm
16	 @ AM201321 Just ask your sister anytime shes home to let me collect them .  I know youre worried I like her more than you . 
16	 @ AM201321 You know ,  I cant even detect sarcasm on twitter  # suspicious

16	 @ shriankakalia Maybe after 7 one weekday  :  ) 
16	 @ Kirbso Haha excellent point .  After the weekend Ive had at Ascot ,  Im far from being in a fit state to drive ,  train it is . 
16	 # christmas is a busy time of year .  Christmas at a daily newspaper is a mental time ,  where busy is a thing of the past
16	 @ misscharl Couldnt agree more ,  sometimes harsh but true is by far the wisest option
16	Clearing four year old mental cobwebs that have been lingering for a long time .  Very ready for a clean slate 2014 . 
16	Missed bus ,  missed appointment and one very unhappy Amita .  2014 is starting afresh from tomorrow . 
16	Men in this house are too loud ,  if its not dad  & amp ;  Archers on every radio around the place ,  its the bro yelling at a screen of FIFA players
16	First time in a very very long time that pictures put on FB have stressed me out ,  no more Christmas partying  # horrendous
16	Grandfather telling me I check my phone too many times .  Actually G ,  its very few times a day .  .  . For hours at a time  # guilty

16	Great night ,  just like we were 18 and in sixth form again .  
16	 @ JennyEGlos I say this but then a few days into January news desk will have convinced me Im only 23 again ha ! 
16	Twitter clear out :  Un following anything that asks me continuously to like or follow something ,  its like spam Central  # farewell
16	 @ missjojangles Love that film and Prince Eric was a dream ! 
16	Great week ahead ,  3 days until  @ disclosure concert  & amp ;  4 days until  @ SomersetHouse Isabella Blow exhibition  # london
