-0.3	Oh FFS !  How can I find 7 seasons of Buffy ,  5 of Angel ,  and not my fucking Firefly DVD ?  !  I might actually cry . 
-0.3	Maybe I lent it to TGIDM ?  I might have done .  Im a nice person after all .  Starting to feel nauseous now .  What if Ive lost my Firefly DVD ?  ! 
-0.3	Ok ,  nobody panic ,  but I cant find my Firefly DVD .  .  .  Deep breaths .  Deep breaths .  Its ok .  Its ok .  .  .  .   # OMFGWHEREISIT ?  !

-0.3	Just finished painting the spare rooms walls pink ,  and gone into have a look .  Thought so ,  looks like a vagina  # wontbespendingmuchtimethere
-0.3	I have realised that looking back on texts I send ,  out of context ,  seem very very wrong indeed .  This might explain why Im single . 
-0.3	 @ MistressKitty good point ,  well made . 
-0.3	Whenever I lay out plastic sheeting when decorating it makes me feel like a hit man .  Which is odd ,  cos when I kill people I feel nothing . 
-0.3	Meeting a new client today ,  and due to a throw away joke Im not sure if he thinks Im a PT or a rent boy .   # schoolboyerror
-0.3	So apparently my bro is bringing his GF across for my sisters wedding .  Im going to be the only single one there !  Woo !   # iamgoingtodiealone

-0.3	 @ OpheliaBenson Ive only been reading his twitter since yesterday ,  so no idea what hes said before that .  .  . 
-0.3	 @ SupportGeekPaul how much more sarcastic can I be ?  A sweepstake on how many kids need to die before the law changes is pretty sarcastic ! 
-0.3	 @ SupportGeekPaul er .  .  .  That was exactly my point in the first place ? 
-0.3	Is it normal to cry when listening to Fairytale of New York ? 
-0.3	 @ OpheliaBenson  @ michaelshermer doesnt everyone ?  I am just liking his commentary on the recent shooting .  Makes a lot of sense . 
-0.3	 @ OpheliaBenson thank you .   @ michaelshermer is most awesome .
