1	 @ jaredplatt I remember you saying on creativeLIVE that you only have one archive drive per year ,  what if it failed with all personal images ? 
1	The best way to  # standout from the crowd is to do something that nobody else dares to do .  Take  # fear by the horns and redefine  # originality ! 
1	 @ abi _ gray Indeed ,  I have a concept up my sleeve that I think  @ LillyLeanne would be perfect for .  Fantasy ,  so styling will be quite different
1	I think this has to be one of my  # favourite pictures I have created this year for  @ NorwichFashion .   # Excited for 2014 !  
1	 @ NorwichFashion I would love to . 
1	Think about the greatness we can achieve in our lives ,  if we just keep trying instead of giving up when times get hard .   # PositiveThinking
1	Slowly revealing the images on Facebook from my Imperfect shoot featured in  @ darkbeautymag ,  but if you cant wait :

1	Cant believe its already been a year since the last time I was running around the woods getting chased by  # zombies  @ ZombieEvac .   # TimeFlies
1	If you are not creating something that really excites you ,  why create anything at all ?   # ShootWhatYouLove  # Photography
1	Yep  @ Missy _ Vintage as  # crazy as they can be .  Time to start expressing ourselves properly ,  as real creative people should do . 
1	 " What we vividly imagine ,  ardently desire and enthusiastically act upon ,  must inevitably come to pass .  "   -   @ sue _ bryce  # CreateYourOwnPath
1	Big scrim  @ LaraJade _   @ felixkunze  @ OscarMay _  looking forward to seeing the results .  Hope the shoot went really well . 
1	Her work is fab .   @ norwichresident  @ NUAnews I am looking to collaborate with her on an editorial story I have in mind .

1	Excellent  @ NchFashionPaper will be great to catch up .  Did you get chance to decide which images you want to use for the magazine ?

1	The  # future belongs to the few of us that are still prepared to get our hands  # dirty . 
1	 @ jaredplatt how about your own personal pictures ,  like family shots etc ,  do you back those up ?  Thanks . 
1	We need to stop trying to make our lives  # perfect and start trying to make them  # interesting .  Life is an adventure .  Tell your own story . 
1	 # Photography is so  # addictive .  You never stop learning no matter who you are  & amp ;  what level youre at .  Always refining ,  changing  & amp ;  improving . 
1	Sometimes the best thing about getting lost ,  is that you rediscover the things you had forgotten .  You reinvent and find yourself once again . 
1	
1	What you create today ,  you will change tomorrow .  What you create tomorrow ,  you will change the next day .  
1	Some of my work for the  @ norwichresident magazine can now be viewed online .  
1	Looking to  # shoot in a large empty barn ,  stable ,  studio or warehouse kind of building ,  with big windows next week if anyone knows anywhere ? 
1	 " I believe the happiest girls are the prettiest girls "  
1	 @ Tokyo _ Pixie wow ,  what useful piece of knowledge I now have ,  lol .

1	 @ Bel _ Beaufighter  @ Missy _ Vintage Thank you .  Very pleased with this shot . 
1	I dont know why I always feel so guilty about  # chilling out .  I always feel like Im doing something  # naughty .  The perks of self - employment ! 
1	Today my plans of work got thrown out the window  & amp ;  instead I enjoyed the day with a friend .  Some of the best things happen without a  # plan . 
1	 " If you want to differentiate yourself from other photographers ,  learn how to pose people "   @ douggordonphoto quote 
1	 " You need to define your photography before somebody else defines it for you "

1	Images from last weeks  # Fashion shoot The Finding are now online :  
1	 " If I can say that I lived an inspired life ,  I will have lived the best possible life .  "  
1	 @ PaulStrowger Well .  I have access to all of them . 
1	Sometimes in order to find new  # inspiration and get a fresh  # perspective ,  all you need to do is turn around and look at what is behind you . 
1	 " If you want to be successful ,  you have to start walking the path to get there "  .   @ douggordonphoto 
1	 @ LaraJade _  Im itching to get some shoots done too .  No fun without a computer .   :  (  I have a few shoots lined up though .
