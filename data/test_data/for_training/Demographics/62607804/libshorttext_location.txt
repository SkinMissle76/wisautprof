29	Aint no fight like a San Francisco NIMBY fight . 
29	My thought for the day :  its never too late to begin . 
29	 @ SigHafstrom um ,  its not really Top 40 then ,  is it ? 
29	 @ torreyac when does a cloud stop being itself and come another cloud ? 
29	I think the whole Ugly Holiday Sweater thing is played out . 
29	Stopped in to see how my architecture students were doing .  Final review is Monday .  Excited to see the sawdust flying in the model shop . 
29	To - do list is pleasantly bifurcating into an already - done list and a free - pass - until - January list . 
29	Unless your name is Jimi Hendrix ,  I really dont think you should call your band The   _  _  _    _  _  _  _  _  _   Experience . 
29	 @ calliloopy congrats on your thesis show !  !  !  ! 
29	Theres a fine line between sun - warmed sangria and tepid mulled wine . 
29	Some people are into saving the world ,  which is awesome as it likely does need saving .  But my calling is to make the world worth living in . 
29	In the car ,  playing techno loud enough that the rearview mirror bounces ,  making the cars behind me look like theyre dancing . 
29	Everything with a side of everything . 
29	Wanna get back in the pool . 
29	Something Im listening to now .  .  .  Fuschia Regalia by  @ theseironlegs 
29	Sometimes you get lucky .  Sometimes you realize that the totality of your being ,  your life ,  your experience went into that luck . 
29	A night in .  Laundry .  Fixing broken things .  Paying bills .  Eating leftovers .  A good antidote to the go - go - go . 
29	Thinking about why those retro old - sign physical 3D letters are so trendy right now .  Analogue backlash against all our screentime ? 
29	Every time I hear about Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack ,  I wonder if he also has a time machine .  I mean ,  who does that anymore ? 
29	A little thing that makes me sad :  seeing someone focused on their smartphone while walking their dog . 
29	Getting closer all the time . 
29	For - tay ! 
29	 @ grownuptown black and blue face . 
29	Sometimes I find I truly identify with kids staring out car windows ,  trying to make sense of this strange wonderful world we live in .

29	Sometimes youve gotta just put it down for a while and give it time .  Which is much harder than it seems . 
29	Penumbra ,  interstitial ,  liminal ,  threshold ,  bardo ,  dusk ,  dawn ,  fermata ,  lurch .  Beautiful or difficult ,  there is nothing like the present .

29	So much in my head and heart and body these days ,  but so little desire to say it here .  Sorry for all the silence .

29	 @ SigHafstrom  @ stackedsax if I was dating  @ stackedsax ,  Id take him to bed early too . 
29	DJ Lee Burridge lesson of the night :  if you play it from a place of love and joy and confidence ,  the crowd will always be right there w / you .
