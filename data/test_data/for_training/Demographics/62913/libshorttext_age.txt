-0.42	 @ unclewilco No Chocoholic but Belgian Urban IPA which I havent tried before .

-0.42	 @ JimJolly I’m all kebabed out after having one on Saturday and one on Sunday .

-0.42	 @ doncaosdelanada I’m going to guess you are in the new popup pub in Spitalfields ?   ;  ) 
-0.42	 @ ThreeUKSupport Hi ,  Just wondering if the post code I supplied was correct ? 
-0.42	 @ DScardiffdrinks  @ thewaenbrewery No problem .  Didnt realise there was a Xmas selection .  Thought they may have been with their other beers
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ We can do good crashes at drag races too  -  
-0.42	 @ doncaosdelanada Don’t think I’ve been in the Pride of Spitalfields .  Have done the Crown and Shuttle .

-0.42	Handy for  @ fgw to announce just before leaving that there are no catering facilities .  Good job I stocked up on Kernel beer and cheese ! 
-0.42	 @ jillpne6 was checking out the new  @ HackandHop pub next to it . 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ they’d throw me out for asking . 
-0.42	 @ CarlDurose even the shopkeeper selling it to me said he’d heard bad things about it .  Should have listened to him . 
-0.42	If I knew there were going to be tables on this bus back to the Port I would have bought a bus beer .

-0.42	 @ PegsontheLine  @ FourBGBeau  @ michaelturtle Saw this in today’s Telegraph and had good memories .

-0.42	 @ fishter _ uk there’s never any funds available . 
-0.42	 @ doncaosdelanada just checked out the Pride of Spitalfields and think I went there a few years ago . 
-0.42	They also said that they have a disclaimer which ‘clearly states that no copyright infringement is intended’ .  Glad that’s cleared up . 
-0.42	 @ LeighGoodStuff  @ markdredge Ha !  Was thinking the same .  Can’t blame a man for succumbing to a good beer .

-0.42	 @ rhncafc I’m sure it would work really well in london .  Probably harder to expand to many other places
-0.42	 @ doncaosdelanada they’re going to be there until the pub closes on Dec 20th .  Popping up on Saturday to check it out . 
-0.42	 @ NewportBus think you need some bus shelters on High Street .

-0.42	 @ unclewilco  @ dorkomatic Not sure you’d want to spend NYE in the Port ! 
-0.42	Love how the bottled beer menus at  @ SmallBarBristol  are hidden away inside old copies of ‘The Top 10 of Everything’ 
-0.42	 @ mattappleby cheers .  We wanted to make sure that the  @ urbantaphouse could update the beers and they’re doing a great job so far . 
-0.42	 @ mattappleby think you may be in the shot I took on the Events page of the Urban Tap House website  ;  ) 
-0.42	 @ BonsVoeux1 usually enjoy most of Rogue  beers .  Picked that one up in North Carolina but after the bacon maple wondering what it’ll be like . 
-0.42	 @ BonsVoeux1 they weren’t on my radar at all until this beer arrived .  The description on that beer sounds so good . 
-0.42	 @ shotbykim My Prime delivery didn’t show today .  Was 160mi away in Gatwick at 4pm .  Amazon CS said they’re confident it’ll be delivered today !

-0.42	 @ rhncafc I used to have a site just for that but you could run into trouble legally with it .  Here’s my response  -  
-0.42	 @ TheWaenBrewery The Snowball in Spoons in Newport is tasting amazing !  Easily the best beer on . 
-0.42	 @ shotbykim I was the only one there do they just kept bringing me more and more meat  :  )

-0.42	 @ JimJolly They have a sour beer ! 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ how else are you going to eat a pickled eggs whilst standing at the bar ! 
-0.42	 @  _  _ SteveM At the moment there arent any privacy options available . 
-0.42	 @ NewportBus cheers for replying .  We all took shelter in the arcade but would be useful having a shelter for each stop . 
-0.42	Enjoying  @ BrewDogBristol all to myself .  
-0.42	 @ TheWaenBrewery Hopefully some bottles of Snowball will be making its way down here . 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ taking photos whilst driving ?  You’re as bad as me ?

-0.42	In Bristol’s newest pub ,   @ SmallBarBristol .  Great interior and equally good beer selection .  
-0.42	Paying a visit to  @ UrbanTapHouse today .  Hope they update the beers on the new website before I get there . 
-0.42	 @ doncaosdelanada hopefully will also check out the new BrewDog and the new pub from the Dean Swift / Old Red Cow owners on Fleet Street . 
-0.42	Hoping that this will become a permanent seasonal beer .   -  Drinking a Snowball by  @ TheWaenBrewery  -  
-0.42	In my ongoing quest to find the cheapest pint of Kernel Table Beer ,   @ BrewDogShepBush is doing well at £4 . 25 ,  Euston Tap not so good at £4 . 40
-0.42	Probably shouldnt be drinking this at this time of the day .  .  .  .   ( Citrus Ninja Exchange )  
-0.42	 @ Joel _ Hughes  @ SmallBarBristol they only sell beers from small breweries and will soon be brewing their own beer . 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ Very impressive how the roll cage was still intact . 
-0.42	 @ curryspcworld Does it normally take 10 days to get a response from your Promotional Team ?  Still waiting .  My case is CC0002134623
-0.42	Good to see that  @ tinyrebelbrewco’s Dirty Stop Out is on the starting lineup at  @ BrewDogShepBush
-0.42	Think I need to attack my  @ beercupboard tomorrow .  
-0.42	 @ PegsontheLine  @ FourBGBeau  @ michaelturtle Definitely . How are you finding Tallinn ?  Visited a few yrs ago .  Nice place ,  easy access to Helsinki
-0.42	 .  @ fgw Is there a record for the most people crammed into a Cardiff to Portsmouth train ?  If not ,  you should start with this service . 
-0.42	 @ TheWaenBrewery there were still some bottles of Snow Ball left  :  )  
-0.42	 @ shotbykim I hope so but it’ll have to get a taxi from the bus station because I’m not going to collect it ! 
-0.42	I’m in cheese heaven !   / cc  @ paxtonscheese 
-0.42	 @ PegsontheLine That’s unusual .  I thought it was a given that they would have snow this time of year . 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ heading to another pub  ;  ) 
-0.42	 @ beermerchants can’t imagine they’re making much on a bottle . 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ yep .  It’s match day here this afternoon so got to the pub early before the crowds . 
-0.42	Spent this afternoon at the newly opened  @ TheCBSC popup pub on Shoreditch High St .  They have a selection of  @ Beerlens photos on display . 
-0.42	 @ jillpne6 unsure what it was like before but it’s nice w /  a good beer selection and judging by the other pubs they own ,  food should be good . 
-0.42	 @ knowhowtohelp Hi ,  Im looking for an update regarding my missing voucher . 
-0.42	 @ rhncafc I have !  Hopefully will extend beyond London . 
-0.42	Skipped dessert and went straight for the Custard Pie  -  Drinking a Custard Pie at  @ urbantaphouse  -  
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ I wouldn’t try it .  Van Gogh used to drink it and it and he cut off his ear . 
-0.42	 @ mattappleby I did recognise you from Untapped but wasn’t 100 %  sure it was you .  My company built the site so was taking a few shots for it . 
-0.42	 @ NateDawg27 you can pick it up from Ales By Mail .  
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ sounds awful ! 
-0.42	 @ NewportBus We automatically presume that you are responsible for all things like that when it’s the council that’s responsible . 
-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ we don’t get that over here . 
-0.42	Surprised that a company that used my photo without asking blamed the  @ eustontap for telling them to take my photo from Google Images . 
-0.42	Spending the afternoon taking shots of the  @ UrbanTapHouse for their new website .  
-0.42	Seems that if  @ Carlsberg _ UK upload the wrong SanMiguel website its not an issue if my photo is reuploaded .  Ill soon be rich from apologies
-0.42	 @ rhncafc  @ UrbanTapHouse I also had to make sure their food and beer was in good nick too… .  It was . 
-0.42	 @ SmallBarBristol Looking forward to popping over to take some shots for Beer 
-0.42	Checking out the new  @ HackandHop off Fleet Street .  Good beer selection like their sister pubs .  
-0.42	 @ mattappleby  @ TaleOfAle  @ farringtons1696  @ Porterhousebars  Good to hear .  Where’s next ? 
-0.42	Nightcap before a trip to the smoke tomorrow ,  an .  .  .   ( Stone 17th Anniversary Götterdämmerung IPA )

-0.42	 @ MeatWagonBBQ Lamb with a mint and ranch dressing and slaw .  Tasted good . 
-0.42	Caught  @ Carlsberg _ UK using one of my photos on their San Miguel website .  They remove it ,  then a month later they put the photo back !  Cheeky ! 
-0.42	TIL why  @ theribman named his hot sauce Holy Fuck .  
-0.42	Bit disappointed with this .   -  Drinking a Voodoo Doughnut Bacon Maple Ale by  @ rogueales  -  
-0.42	 @ rhncafc  @ MelissaCole  @ BrewDogShepBush  @ theribman I think someone else may have been at that sauce .  I wast brave enough to use that much ! 
-0.42	 @ rhncafc forgot to add that the fries were double cooked in salt .  Best not take a photo of the Black pudding scotch egg I’ve got for later
-0.42	 @ Beerymatt I don’t think I’ve managed to get in and out in less than 30 minutes . 
-0.42	 @ doncaosdelanada the new popup has got a selection of beer lens photos on display there  :  )
