18	Happiness is not something you postpone for the future ;  it is something you design for the present . 
18	life is too short ,  laugh when u can ,  apologize when u should ,  and let go of what u cant change ,  Love deeply and forgive quickly . 
18	Never make the same mistake twice ,  There are so many new ones ,  Try a different one each day . 
18	Just remember ,  when youre feeling down :  You were that ONE sperm that won the race . 
18	If u ain God yea , ur approval isnt needed .  .  .
