-0.46	I’m so tired of people trying to reset my password .  This is MY account and has been for quite a few years folks .  Please stop !   :  )   # thanks
-0.46	 @ carltonreid I’ve had that when it’s downloading one the buzz comes well before the notification .  it usually comes ,  just much later . 
-0.46	 @ JoshOwenMorris ceramic vs paper makes all the difference in terms of taste .   # imacoffeenerd
-0.46	 @ RevealThePath any idea if / when it’ll be in iTunes ? 
-0.46	 @ UCI _ Overlord didn’t you have a link to a good piece on why USADA can strip Lance of titles or why they asking for it leads to it happening . 
-0.46	I’m trying to find a good piece that explains WHY USADA can strip Lance of his titles .  Something that isn’t mainstream trash but has facts . 
-0.46	 @ soozed I figured ,  I’m just jealous  :  )  I hope you have a blast riding it ! 
-0.46	 @ soozed nice but what’s that plastic disc near the rear cassette ?   ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ UCI _ Overlord  @ CyclingCentral  @ joelfelicio I really hope next cycling season brings fresh perspective  ( faces )  and they clean some house . 
-0.46	 @ velocast Now that’d make an interesting TdF to watch ,  unlike the snooze of 2012 .  By the way ,  very much enjoying your  # vuelta2012 coverage ! 
-0.46	 @ soozed yes !  Is that your new bike ?  Looks wicked fun … heading to palos  & amp ;  john muir for some off roading ? 
-0.46	 @ fatcyclist random question ,  have you ever seen a cross bike finish Leadville ?  I’m curious if it would be possible or just too impractical . 
-0.46	 @  _ Pigeons _  Wordpress does not but if you use google to track hits as well you need to tell google your ip addresses so it won’t track you . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy I’m curious if there are more than TdF ,  especially in US given how bad the TV coverage is here of Vuelta .  You’re It ! 
-0.46	 @ AdamMyerson that sounds like something trek would do ,  friggin annoying and 3 of them from different stores no less .   @ TrekBikes
-0.46	 @ sofaboy I subscribed but can’t find the link to the feed to add to my app .  I can login and see the circles for each stage but no feed URL ? 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy so are the podcast directions going to be updated for the Vuelta ?  They have the TdF URL which obviously won’t work  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ lynskey _ ti random question ,  is it possible to strip a to frame  ( cooper w / satin )  to get the natural finish ?  wasn’t sure if you’d do that . 
-0.46	 @ soozed It’s been crazy good I have to agree .  We’ve bought one per week for the past few months .   # yumm
-0.46	 @ soozed No ,  just my normal tire .  Maybe I just need a new trainer tire to swap in .  My current trainer is 11 ~  years old . 
-0.46	Can anyone recommend another bike trainer like Lemond that doesn’t eat your tires but is maybe quieter ?  Still on the fence with the Lemond . 
-0.46	 @ bike _ junkie I think they tried selling those or something like them a few years ago on the Biggest Loser .  Didn’t quite catch on . 
-0.46	 @ solarpowerspork  @ mikelikesbikes thanks for the help ,  I’ll check them out ! 
-0.46	 @ BobRidesABike Wow that’s horrible ,  the tragedies not the riding .  Stay safe and hydrated man ! 
-0.46	Best Chicago area bike fitter ?  Can they help me make adjustments to my existing bike to bit better or only new ?   # bikeCHI  # cycling
-0.46	 @ sofaboy  @ aglogan  @ velocast wow that’s some good numbers  ;  )  let me know if you need a water boy or feed zone musette bag guy . 
-0.46	 @ millarmind I just picked up your book  ( on Kindle )  ,  can’t wait to give it a read !  Keep your focus and honesty ,  your truly inspirational ! 
-0.46	 @ CharlieCycles  @ dennrunner isn’t about that ,  it’s about your team leader being a jerk and not letting you even win a stage with  & lt ;  3km to go . 
-0.46	 .  @ dennrunner show him up and make him know who’s the better ride I say .  Wiggo is beyond boring and without a TT he’s off the podium I’d bet . 
-0.46	I’m kinda hoping for a technical problem with Wiggo in the final time trial to make this years  # TdF interesting and crown Froome instead . 
-0.46	 @ Vaughters  @ inrng the US has class separation and inequality that’s hard to break through as well ,  its not like we’re all IPO’ing over here . 
-0.46	 @ VeloVoices I’ve never been ,  can’t wait till my kids get old enough for a few trips to Europe .  It’d be great to experience a few . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy does anyone actually buy these car company bikes ?  I can’t say I’ve ever seen one on the road … for the rich blokes I guess . 
-0.46	 @ VeloVoices yea ,  the classics this year were a hoot compared to this tour .  TT are the death of the ‘12  # TdF … give me a classic please ! 
-0.46	 @ VeloVoices the top 5 are in a slumber ,  it’s all about the KoM jersey now !  Team Sky and Wiggo are putting the peloton  ( and viewers )  to sleep
-0.46	 @ JoshOwenMorris I wish ,  100 +  degrees weeks have relegated me to the trainer in the evening .  High hopes for this weekend ! 
-0.46	What’s funnier ,  that  @ Liquigas _ Cdale had to post this or that people thought the accounts were real ?   @ procyclinglive w
-0.46	 @ heidiswift I’m glad it’s not either ,  your doing awesome and are truly inspiring !   # revetour  # inspirational
-0.46	 @ Vaughters I forgot to include you ,  only so many characters but here’s a link to my supporting tweet :  
-0.46	 @ ChipotleTweets Thanks a Chiplotta for sponsoring  @ CFSDevTeam .  I love it when healthy foods and healthy sports join to support each other ! 
-0.46	 @ festinagirl true ,  just don’t be afraid to ask because few people comment on form till asked .  Then everyone has an opinion  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ festinagirl running is hard on the body ,  that’s for sure .  As a heavy guy losing I know 1st hand .  If pain continues look at running form to . 
-0.46	I’m always amazed how much quieter my twitter feed is on  # TdF rest days . 
-0.46	 @ heidiswift that little warmup bump  ;  )  not a problem .  Good luck tomorrow … stay healthy  & amp ;  hydrated !   # revetour
-0.46	 @ heidiswift do you ride at all on your off day to keep the legs going and ready for the remaining 5 days ?   # revetour
-0.46	 @ Onixbikes Your twitter id went from a great story about your company and cool pics to news  & amp ;  store sale spam .  Is this the new you ? 
-0.46	 @ SRAMontheroad I can even stop by your Chicago office as I’m also in Chicago .  I can blog about it in exchange for the loaner . 
-0.46	 @ SRAMontheroad I have a hilly race on 8 / 11 ,  200 km of hilly fun .  I’m still not quite sure what I’m gonna do .  Wanna loan me a proto ?   ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ theroaddiaries  @ muddylegs if only they were for sale somewhere in the US .  Product marketing failure ,  Force WiFli not available until 8 / 15 . 
-0.46	 @ Onixbikes Use Firefox of Safari to spoof UserAgent to test it .  Seems you forgot the mobile Internet  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ Onixbikes visiting it in an iPhone brings up nothing usable at all though clicking the desktop button works . 
-0.46	 @ bike _ junkie yea post holiday mid week Mondays are horrible .  Happy Monday 2 . 0 !   # mondayversion2
-0.46	Wow this latest tour chats podcast sounds horrible ,  not even necessarily worth posting let alone listening to .  Figure out audio beforehand . 
-0.46	 @ velocast LOVE the  # TdF show ,  I apologize now for calling you both British .  Also ,  who travels with an iMac ?  Buy an Air or MacBook Pro  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ heidiswift is everything ok ?  Why the bloody nose ? 
-0.46	I love listening to brits broadcasting the tour ,  I’m very much enjoying  @ velocast  # TdF podcast … can’t recommend it more . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy you’re not following me  ;  )  can’t DM
-0.46	I really hope  # TdF doesn’t turn into the Tour of California with Sagan as it will  ( did )  become very boring to watch . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy So what was the word  /  directions then on how to get it into the Apple Podcasts app ?  I don’t see an add feed button anywhere . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy paid content in other apps so that’s a pretty solid indication . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy a free subscription bet says they do  ;  )  look at bottom of this screen shot .  Redeem is only available for… 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy rumor has it that they’re adding paid podcasts ,  maybe next year if you choose to use it .  I’ll think about the Goodreader option . 
-0.46	 @ sofaboy do you know if the podcasts can be used with the new Apple Podcasts app ? 
-0.46	 @ JoshOwenMorris they need to figure out their priorities .  Did you at least invite them to the pub ?   # TdF
-0.46	 @ FredCast having to remember to download and sync manually in the old iTunes app was painful ,  this one auto downloads and has other features
-0.46	 @ FredCast Awesome !  Thanks for the quick reply ,  love the show and with this new app will be much much more frequent of a listener  :  ) 
-0.46	 @ FredCast in the feed ,  though I’d imagine in the show it would be nice as well except I don’t watch my feed whilst listening  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ FredCast I’m pretty sure you just have to upload one as the other feeds look great with their high resolution images . 
-0.46	 @ FredCast with the new podcasts app on the iPad  ( retina )  it would be awesome if the fredcast logo wasn’t blurry .  Need high resolution img ! 
-0.46	 @ bikehugger sounds like how my day went except replace netbeans with eclipse .   # beingbacktoworkispainful
-0.46	 @ BryceDaviess nice moots rig ,  is that a single speed  ( kinda hard to tell but looks like it )  for all 100 ? 
-0.46	 @ bike _ junkie u riding tomorrow in the MS ride ?  If so good luck !  I wish I were ,  next year for sure . 
-0.46	 @ friebos Kindle ?  iTunes ? 
-0.46	 @ soozed sounds like a WFH day  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ aliengin my aspirations were put off a year because of a new bundle of joy .  Next year for both of us then !   ;  )  IM WI 2013 ? 
-0.46	 @ Cycleboredom  @ SkratchLabs what about it do you like over other drinks ? 
-0.46	Is  @ RevealThePath going to be for sale on iTunes in mid July as well ? 
-0.46	 @ soozed 20 round trip or one way ?  Why didn’t you commute last year if I might ask ?  Too hectic ,  safety ,  just curious . 
-0.46	 @ mikelikesbikes I subscribe to a lot of the bike race feeds here and it’s gets crazy on race day and it’s spoiler time during TdF as well . 
-0.46	 @ mikelikesbikes this is my bike account ,  I am  @ learnfitness ,  I did it before they had lists and it was hard to read my timeline ,  too busy . 
-0.46	 @ soozed how far is your daily commute ?  I’m thinking of commuting to Chicago each day and mine would be 22 mi one way .   # bikechi  # cycling
-0.46	 @ saddleblaze I think most people are past that point ,  he threw in the towel before the race began . 
-0.46	 @ PaulSherwen Dropbox all the way ! 
-0.46	 @ RevealThePath are you planning to come to Chicago any time with the movie ? 
-0.46	I’m making some adjustments to my bike for some climbing ,  any advice would be appreciated :

-0.46	Anyone know if the SRAM force 53 / 39 front will work with the 11 / 32 rear ?  Trying to find a good climbing setup .  50 / 34  &  11 / 32 is lowest . 
-0.46	Any chance  @ PhilLiggett and  @ PaulSherwen are MCing Paris Nice for NBC today ?  Theyre missed and are preferred over their recent choice . 
-0.46	 @  _ WizzyWill  ?  ? 
-0.46	Im constantly finding myself at  @ sevencycles website and Im unable to browse their bikes because their site doesnt work on an iPad .   # fail
-0.46	The Inverted Bike Shop ,  sometimes back to basics just makes sense … 
-0.46	I wonder why my  @ Catlikehelmets Whisper Plus doesnt have the logo on the front like Team Exergy ?  
-0.46	I love the helmets ,  go  @ catlikehelmets RT  @ SRAMontheroad :  Team Exergy Twenty12 looks ready to roll .   What do you think ?  
-0.46	 @ lynskey _ ti I miss the part of your old site where it had a amazing pictures of the different builds of a bike .  New site lacks personality . 
-0.46	 @ bike _ junkie ditto that ,  I just need to find the convincing reason to sway my wife into letting me get one  ;  ) 
-0.46	 @ PowerOfBicycles being in Chicago  ( like you )  seeing a ride here would be awesome !
