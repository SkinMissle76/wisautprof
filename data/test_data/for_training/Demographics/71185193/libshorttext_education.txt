2	ET might have been fair to MJ in the past ,  but probably not .  Every media outlet seemed only to want to dish out stuff in a negative light . 
2	Entertainment Tonight made me cry .  Story about woman with vitiligo like MJ had .  FINALLY they are saying the truth .  .  . but why couldnt theyB4 ? 
2	 @ MJ _ istheking Aw ,  your very welcome !   :  )  Hope your rents come home soon an let you go free !  TTFN  .  .  & lt ; 3 & lt ; 3 & lt ; 3

2	MJ _ istheking Im sorry that they arent giving you the respect and support U deserve ,  U seem like hardworking student and good daughter .  .  . 
2	 @ MJ _ istheking Yeah ,  that is true .  .  . I had to accept my parents for being who they are ,  the good qualities with the let - downs .  .  . 
2	MJ _ istheking I mean ,  have you requested a discussion and they just wont talk w / you ? 
2	 @ MJ _ istheking this may sound like stupid question ,  but did U  &  ur parents all sit and have a talk about their expectations / your needs ,  etc ? 
2	Dropped off apps at two Starbucks today .  .  . wanna get 2nd job so I can save up for travel ,  school .  .  . grr .  .  &  trip to CA so I can see Capt . Eo !  !  ! 
2	 .  .  . tried to get drivers attention ,  but they changed lanes and left us behind .  . hope I run into that person again !   ( haha ,  not literally .  .  .  )

2	 @ mjsunifc  & gt ;  .  . and not cuz I saw  " liberian girl "  ,  cuz I never have seen that pic w / the song title with it before ,  lol
2	 @ mjsunifc Weird ,  before looking at the pic you posted of MJ posing in a yellow shirt ,  thats exactly the pic that flashed in my mind ! 
2	 .  .  . I kept myself warm in the rain while waiting for the bus by thinking of Michael Jackson ! 
2	The cold may be uncomfortable ,  but I love being in the rain .  .  . and the song I was hearing in my head was ,  Stranger in Moscow .  .  . 
2	Whew !  Just got back home from a long bus ride from school across town .  Its overcast and cold and raining here in Vegas -  - kinda rare here .  .  . 
2	Thank you from the bottom of my heart ,  Michael .  I really dont have words to put the feelings into .  Mine and Im sure everyones .  WeLOVEyou ! 
2	She had nice story to share ,  maybe someday Ill get her to share it with everyone somehow . 
2	She said that all she could think of to say to him at first was  " You smell good !  "  The bodyguard told her it was Giorgio . 
2	At first show ,  I met some fans ,  one of whom actually met Michael in 1984 where he was staying in the hotel .  She got to talk with him ! 
2	Just got home from seeing This Is It one last time .  Afterwards ,  I was just full of nervous energy .  Still am . 
2	Ughh ,  gotta get started on this next big mass of homework !  !   :  (  Hopefully I will have it finished by Monday
2	 @ FreshlyPut  .  .  . and shes not a big fan now ,  but I guess she really wanted to go see him then .  .  . shes a supporter ,  though . 
2	 @ FreshlyPut LOL !  !  !  well do !  jk
2	My friend who saw it with me told me she got to go to the BAD concert in Hawaii when she was a teenager !  !  .  .  . aghh !  ! 
2	Had problems with my internet explorer last night ,  but I went to see This Is It again twice more .  . took friend from work -  - she enjoyed it ! 
2	Just a  " drive - by "  Tweet tonite ,  I am soo tired .  Lemme RT myself :  Im thankful for all my friends ,  family ,  and of course ,  Michael Jackson !  :  "  ) 
2	Its technically Thanksgiving now .  I am thankful for all my friends ,  family ,  and of course ,  Michael Jackson .   :  "  ) 
2	I cant sleep .  All I can think of is Michael .  I just saw This Is It again tonight twice in a row at Sams Town .  My heart is aching . 
2	Ugg ,  I love the learning  &  social part of school ,  but near the end of a semester I cant wait for it all to end !  !  I hated to miss This Is It
2	Finally got my report for psychology DONE .  Just have to do the  " works cited "  page and an essay for sociology and plan my class presentation . 
2	Earlier today I saw This is it for the 5th time with  @ mjsunifc and a few other  # MJFAM friends !  mmmmMichael !  !  ! 
2	I didnt know movies had such a short run in the IMAX theatres .  Cinnemark theatres has  " XD "  similar to imax ,  but TII is not in those either . 
2	Next best thing might be to see it at the Rave theatres on the west side of town -  - they were rated best for cinema sound ,  Im going there . 
2	I was so upset about This is it not being in IMAX ,  I cried and frantically searched the internet to find ANY place that was showing it IMAX . 
2	Hey ,   # IMAX  ,  please put  # ThisIsIt back in your theatres .  I was so ticked that Michael cant be seen on IMAX anymore !  !  :  ( 
2	RT :   @ MJ _ istheking ,   @ sohappi :  a moment of silence 4 the soldiers who were killed in Fort Hood Pass it on  &  add a star when u do *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 
2	THAT makes the going a lot easier .  .  . Im always making something more difficult than it has to be ,  lol .  . 
2	I wanted to know if  " neuroplasticity "  was too broad a topic  ( it prob was )   &  I found out that I dont need to make a hypothesis .  . WHEW .  .  . 
2	Phew !  Ive been stressing over all my homework  ( report papers )  ,  but after meeting w / my professor before class today ,  it seems I didnt hav to
2	 @ MJ _ istheking Yeah ,  at first I thught people were spamming me ,  but it was just the websites they signed up on to take quizes ,  play games , etc
2	 @ FreshlyPut Glad youre having a great time in L . A .   ( and your day at Disneyland )  !   :  ) 
2	Aw ,   @ trulove4mj is so sweet .  Thank you from me -  - and I know ,  twitter is hard to quit sometimes ,  grrr .  Goodnight ! 
2	 @ MJ _ istheking Thanks for posting for us all the beautiful pictures !  !  !  Enjoyed them so much . 
2	 @ SunShi9Smile Then ,  I finally noticed the round one on his face in one of the closer shots  ( yeah ,  cute !  )  ,  aww ,  I love his smile ,  LOVE IT . 
2	 @ SunShi9Smile Thanks for the pics of Michael in NJ !  At first ,  I didnt notice the band - aid at all ,  I was looking for it one of his fingers ! 
2	 -  - OK ,  nevermind ,  that link didnt work either ,  sorry !   .  . Well ,  I just had him on my mind all day .  .  . I still cant believe it .  .  :  ( 
2	oops ,

2	 .  .  ( cont ) MJ was talking about issues close to his heart .  . and the press conference where hes talking about the plans for that themepark ( cont ) 
2	I was just watching some rare MJ videos and interviews online .  .  . I always thought he was magical to listen to  &  watch .  .  .  ( cont )  .  . 
2	But as long as its  # ThisIsIt ,  Ill see it in any theatre . 
2	I cant wait to see  # ThisIsIt again .  In  # IMAX ,  of course .  Yeah ,  the screens huge ,  but also the sound quality there is just superior !
