3	Lets place bets on how long my train journey from Reigate to East Cronx will take tonight .   # southernFail
3	Really not used to being up so early on a Sunday morning . 
3	 @ Daylightfire make it a Wednesday night ,  and we can take advantage of cheep booze in the Bell . 
3	I just earned the Weekday Warrior badge on  @ untappd !  
3	 @ SouthernRailUK not disputing this .  But if its so important why not have more than 1 person checking tickets and install more gates
3	This journey back home ,  might be OK now .  .  .  
3	 @ goughie69 ah phew ,  was getting worried that I was in the minority .  I really hate all the hype that surrounds that X - factor crap .

3	 @ threeuksupport why have I had no data signal in Hyde Park this afternoon ? 
3	 @ TheDukeofSurrey Ive no idea what youre sayin
3	 @ blacksquarebrig can you blame them ?  Whod want to live in the Cronx if they had a choice ? 
3	 @ PbnowD he thinks were not important enough for him to waste his time with  @ TheDukeofSurrey
3	 @ PbnowD oh ,  are you really ?  oh well .  .  . 
3	 @ GiraffeBanners and the fish wasnt bad either ! 
3	 @ TfLBusAlerts  @ METROBUS why have I had to wait 25 minutes for a 64 bus from Selsdon to East Croydon ? 
3	 .   @ TheDukeofSurrey saw this and thought of you .  .  .  
3	 @ TheDukeofSurrey but you do live in Croydon . 
3	Escaping for a few days  (  @  London  @ Gatwick _ Airport  ( LGW )  w /  17 others )  
3	I suppose celebrating the opening of a new station entrance is a highlight ,  when youre a town like the Cronx . 
3	 @ Trombonewaaard I thought it was actually quite appropriate . 
3	 @ PbnowD if you do ,  make sure you also wear a pair of UGGs ,  it would have a profound effect on  @ TheDukeofSurrey
3	I just earned the Merry Brew - mas  ( 2013 )  badge on  @ untappd !  
3	 @ thegaryhawkins are you sure youre not referring to the Reigate women that dont work ? 
3	 @ Get _ mummy _ a _ gin but youve got gin .  So everything should be alright ? 
3	time to reflect  & amp ;  commiserate .  .  . 
3	I do have a couple of hopes and best wishes ,  but Im not gonna share them as theyre private  & amp ;  I dont need to brag about them . 
3	 @ Trombonewaaard really not sure what Ive said to offend you .  Oh well ,  your loss I suppose . 
3	 @ HangingPuppet and Merry Christmas to you .  Was about to say hi as we left ,  but you werent there .  So wasnt ignoring you either .

3	 @ Trombonewaaard when do you go back ?   ;  -  ) 
3	Having a G & amp ; T .  Nothing more to add .  
3	 @ SouthernRailUK thanks for reply .  By red zone do you mean the platform ?   & amp ;  does line block mean closing the track ?  Seems bit excessive
3	Happy Easter !  !  
3	 @ 98rosjon my life would be  great if  @ SouthernRailUK provided the service I pay an extortionate amount for ! 
3	 @ PbnowD have a great holiday . 
3	 @ LizardNun thanks for that .  Still think too much is spent for a couple of minutes of wow . 
3	Gone for a walk ,  to get away from it all .  .  . 
3	 @ TheDukeofSurrey  @ Trombonewaaard have fun there
3	Anybody know what the heck this is meant to be ?  
3	Ah good memories of being in Chicago .

3	 @ tazismad hardly .  Youre better than me !   ;  -  ) 
3	And seriously whats the point in making  new year resolutions ?  Chances are youll never stick to them . 
3	 @ SouthernRailUK the performance results on your website ,  havent been updated since August .  Are you hiding something ?

3	Farewell Amsterdam ,  its been great to getaway ! Cheers !  !  
3	 @ goughie69 Im impressed !  Keep up the good work  ( trying not to sound too patronising ) 
3	 @ TheDukeofSurrey thought they took a selfie instead ?   @ Trombonewaaard
3	 @ AGirl _ ALife I just read BBC news ,  so I assumed it was true .  When did they ever get it wrong ?   ;  -  ) 
3	Yet again the departure gate is furthest away from the departure lounge .  One day ,  maybe itll be from gate 1 .  Though I doubt it very much . 
3	 @ thegaryhawkins you have been !  !   ;  -  )    @ BizzyRascal
3	 @ 98rosjon then Id suggest you dont visit daHudd  ( aka Huddersfield )  .  Its well hilly .
