1	I know Im a bit behind having just read / seen POBAW but  @ LoganLerman is exactly how I pictured Charlie in the book .  Portrayed perfectly . 
1	Since I read the book in a day ,  think Ill give Perks of Being a Wallflower a watch ! 
1	After sitting with the TV on mute for about 20 mins ,  Ive now realised why I dont sit in complete silence more

1	ITS JUST WEIRD .  And I know the circumstances are strange but just PACK IT IN .  You should know when to say ,  actually ,  no . 
1	Creep . 
1	And the fact that you let your little dog tag along with you is too fucking far mate .  Fuck off with your own family ,  or better yet ,  hers . 
1	Why the fuck are you still ANYTHING to do with my family ?  You are my EX . 
1	Well thats fucking pissed me off .  You know when you just smile and let it happen for too long without saying anything ?

1	 @ Gagsy92 I recall what scene it actually was !  It was the brick scene .  .  .  Harrrryyyy ?  .  .  .  .  Haaarrryyy ! 
1	 @ Gagsy92 hahah she certainly did .  .  she was like AW HELL NAW
1	 @ Gagsy92 dammit !  Isnt hindsight a wonderful thing ?  I may pretend I did say that in future re - tellings or this story .  .  . 
1	 @ Gagsy92 haha I was more like da fuck haha !  I dont think I put 2 and 2 together for a couple seconds
1	 @ Gagsy92 apparently he was a suspect for other burglaries too
1	 @ Gagsy92 the police didnt even do anything they made a spectacle over Christmas then didnt even charge him and let him go . 
1	 @ Gagsy92  .  .  he ran away when he saw me though .  I ran after him but he jumped the fence onto a pitch black field
1	 @ Gagsy92  .  .  .  Obviously thought no one was in .  .  .  Even though you can see the TV from the back room and it was clearly on . 
1	 @ Gagsy92  .  .  . I got up to check and the dog was asleep and when I looked up into the back room he was just stood staring at me .  .  . 
1	 @ Gagsy92 I was sitting in the living room when he came in the back of the house ,  I heard something but thought it was the dog .  .  .   ( cont ) 
1	Dont worry guys ,  he didnt get away with anything ,  caught him before he got the chance .   # topdetective
1	It was one year ago today that I caught a burglar in my house .  Strangely enough I was watching Home Alone at the time . 
1	 @ evanrachelwood and  @ 1jamiebell are the sweetest most well matched couple in the universe .  If I ever have a relationship like that .  .   # happy

1	Ordered something last week ,  meant to take up to 7 working days to come .  .  .  It only just got shipped today .  Christ . 
1	 @ LiamNashy that is so nice  :  )  actually made me smile for the first time today !  Thank you ! 
1	People are dicks . 
1	 @ LiamNashy so then why do I care about others feelings so much ?  They dont give a shit about mine . 
1	 @ LiamNashy just been thinking and it happens more than Id like to admit .  Genuine regard for someones feelings is so rare these days . 
1	When you think of the roles in the reverse you dont half see the hypocrisy in some people . 
1	More to the point why do I put up with it ? 
1	Why do people seem to think its okay to walk all over me and have a complete disregard for my feelings ? 
1	 @ zydrate _ anatomy no YOURE awesome !   :  ) 
1	Got dat Sunday feeling
1	I am feeling very meh today
1	 @ zydrate _ anatomy awwwwh you little sweetheart !   :  )  same goes for you ! 
1	 @ AcesHigh _  _  _  _  also your prof pic looks rather ominooos
1	 @ AcesHigh _  _  _  _  was good seeing you today man  :  )  hope you are well ! 
1	 # BouncersAreKnobs
1	Covered in bruises after last night ,  stupid bouncer shoving me into a table to get to a fight .  .  .  That already had 2 bouncers breaking it up . 
1	Even though Im probably gonna spend half the day in bed anyway . 
1	Actually didnt wanna wake up but when I looked at the time thought I shouldve . 
1	Best nights sleep . 
1	I remember beig terrified of the slide in seaside sammys .  I never did go down .  .  .  Well willingly anyway .  
1	 @ LiamNashy hahaha oh god  :  ) 
1	Omg  @ kevinbacon profile pic is where Roger dresses up as him in American Dad .  .  .  Day made
1	Maybe then sleep will come . 
1	Soon enough Im gonna start thinking Im fucking Socrates or something so Im gonna put my phone away and squeeze my eyes shut tight . 
1	Nothing good ever happens after 2am .  How I Met Your Mother taught me that . 
1	Aaand now Im having those seemingly philosophical revelations that people have when theure exhausted .  When really theyre just bullshit
1	BUT THERE IS SO MUCH TO PONDER ,  IS THERE NOT ? 
1	Im guessing thats what is keeping me up .  .  .  My mind running 1000 miles per minute . 
1	My thought processes change very quickly and erratically .  As you can probably see from my tweets .  Seconds apart ,  complete different subject . 
1	Can I be a witch plz
1	I like sleep and I had a good sleeping pattern !  !  Damn whatever it is keeping me awake .  Damn it to hell . 
1	Why am I awake .  Usually I cant keep my eyes open past 12 and this past week Ive been up til like 3 / 4 . 
1	Everyone wants to kill Fiona ,  but I love her .   # AHSCoven
1	Surprise bitch ,  I bet you thought youd seen the last of me .   # AHSCoven
1	The cute little face Kyle makes when Zoey puts headphones on him .   # AHSCoven
1	Well ,  Queenie didnt hesitate for very long to switch sides did she ?   # AHSCoven
1	 @ curtisjt _  those are the reasons I hope to be one someday haha ! 
1	 @ curtisjt _  well obviously you would think that !  Kyle is lush though so cant blame them for wanting to make a sandwich with him .  .  . 
1	 @ curtisjt _  not saying it wasnt hot .  .  .  But the long term of it all .  .  not sure how I feel . 
1	 @ millieme0w Lushy lips on your prof pic babe
1	Im not sure how I feel about the Zoey - Madison - Kyle threesome .  .  .   # AHSCoven
1	 @ Kiiiiirstenn I expected as much .  I ordered it last week but it only just got shipped today .  Hopefully will get it before new year
1	 @ millieme0w that sounds suitable .  I wonder whether hell think that is mega lolz
1	 @ millieme0w well I think prison alone will be a death sentence .  Hell get slaughtered in there ,  thats if he doesnt kill himself first
1	Hey kid ,  dont you think youve got to try and be somebody ?  Yeah ,  it happens on its own . 
1	 @ bethmoore _  _  yeah I know its disgusting .  He also said he didnt know what everyone was so freaked about .  Hmmm .  .  .  Well . 
1	Ian Watkins has been sentenced to 35 years .  Proof that they dont always go easy on celebrities .  Good . 
1	Nil .  I imagine that is the answer .  Ill be lucky if I get it before New Year ! 
1	What are the chances of a package coming from America ,  which has just been shipped ,  coming before Christmas ? 
1	 @ OsricChau finally caught up on the SPN mid season finale .  WHAT THE HELL DUDE !  I did NOT see that coming .  This will not do .  I am very upset . 
1	Finally caught up on the mid season finale of Supernatural .  WHAT THE HELL YOU CANT LEAVE IT LIKE THAT
1	When you have to kill Walter in Fable 3 .  Cruel .  Very emotional .

1	 @ LiamNashy awh thanks !  You too ! 
1	 @ LiamNashy magazine journalism ,  Im in my final year so its got proper hard now .  Its all multimedia now not just magazines  :  / 
1	 @ zydrate _ anatomy hahaha oh you ! 
1	So now Im probably gonna get a low mark because Ill have to do my back up plan . 
1	And the people I was meant to be doing it on arent answering any of my messages and have no phone number apparently . 
1	Also ,  I am FREAKING OUT about the uni work I have to do over the holidays .  .  .  I dont have the right programmes for this shit  :  ( 
1	This week I need to finish my Christmas shopping .  .  . 
1	See what I did there ?  Cross the road ?  Crossroads ?  SEE YOU AT DA CROSSROADS CROSSROADS

1	Cant wait to be done with uni so I can pursue what I actually want to do in life . 
1	It genuinely upsets me that I cant be her . 
1	I am in love with Jennifer Lawrence .  Shes so down to earth yet so talented ,  and she actually looks like a woman and not a rake .

1	 @ zydrate _ anatomy hes from The Hunger Games haha  : P hes played by Liam Hemsworth
1	AND I KNOW THEYRE THE SAME PERSON .  .  .  I know what I mean and thats what matters . 
1	But dont get me wrong ,  I wouldnt kick Liam Hemsworth out of bed either ,  its just Gale is brawny . 
1	Had a dream I got pregnant to Gale Hawthorne .  Not Liam Hemsworth ,  Gale Hawthorne .  That is an extremely important factor .  Mmm yummy .

1	Finally watching the mid season finale .  Even though its already been ruined for me !   # TWD
1	Amount of time it takes The Governor to rehabilitate and go crazy again :  1 and a half episodes .
