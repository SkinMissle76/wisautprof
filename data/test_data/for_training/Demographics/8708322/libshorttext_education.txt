3	“ @ DoLectures :  Run for a clear mind ,  not a finish line . ”
3	 @ muddybike is it not something to do with a lovely day  =  more cyclist  +  more cars  =  increase chance of collisions . 
3	Just received an email from  @ KingofShaves that has so many marketing messages I got dizzy .  More Ts & amp ; Cs than useful stuff  # overkill
3	 @ shadchnev haha !  Looking forward to a busy week !

3	I hear the  @ granarykitchen is prepping for a big cooking weekend !  ! 
3	 @ netmag guys you need to limit your HP overlay ad to 1 per user per day  ( at the very least !  )  .  Feels like the 1990s of pop ups with auto play

3	Just wondering  @ PeasandFigs but is tuna steak ,  sweet potato ,  and cottage cheese good for my  # glutenfree diet ? 
3	 @ KingofShaves  @ KingofShavesSUB it is the multiple WARNING messages at checkout that are odd .  Again US / Canada is catered for but in £££
3	The final week at  # makersacademy is going to be hectic but dam it will be fun .  Bring it on !  
3	 @ CoffeePunks  @ LouiseMensch  @ JoelTaylorMetro he feels a lot more connected to real people than Osborne et al .  Maybe we are all clowns !

3	 @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ laura _ hyde  @ stellacreasy agree .  I am starting to think MPs do more tweeting than governing .  A shame . 
3	Building a google maps based app is hard graft .  Lucky we have  # makersacademy helping us learn the ropes super quick !  
3	Off to Bournemouth today for a big wedding but might cram project work in on the train .   # makeracademy does not stop 
3	 @ pactcoffee persever  @ GraemeHurst .  .  . there is no comparison as once brewed up  # freshisbest every time !

3	 @ BrockleyMarket love your new website guys but you have missed a trick  -  not great on a mobile ,  especially the map  :  -  (   # responsivedesign
3	 @ mailbox thanks for the reply .  Not quite sure what it all means but just know I lost a long email this morning which was gutting

3	 @ netmag guys I love your site but that HP pop up is really annoying after 10 +  showings with auto - audio .  .  .

3	 @ BrockleyMarket no worries . 
3	Love Your  @ Zendesk The Fastest Way to Great Customer Support ,  unless you are asking them  " our forums are your best option for getting help "

3	Like fresh coffee .  Delivered ?  Join the  @ beanandground Coffee Club with this link to enjoy a free box  
3	 @ laura _ hyde  @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ stellacreasy my wider point being that it is not what MPs broadcast that matters ,  it is what they accomplish . 
3	 @ JordanPoulton  @ eyeofjordan  @ wstn online ads have the same issues .  Only 0 . 10 %  of online display impressions result in a trackable action .

3	Lovely call with  @ housebites just now .  Impressed with your food ,  service ,  team .  Shame the website is not very mobile friendly  :  ( 
3	 @ heroku hey guys  -  any ideas how you revert to a rolled back version of a live site ?  When cloning down it reverts to the last commit before . 
3	 @ FollowGousto ah not probs .  We are in London so everyone is out ,  plus not hidden bush to put it under .  HouseBite offer a post 7pm  ;  -  ) 
3	 @ jamesdeer will there be a reserve list ?  Looks like a must - not - miss event ! 
3	 @ industry oops your twitter feed just broke free !   ;  ) 
3	 @ jamesdeer awesome thanks James .  Keep us posted as will be first to snap them up  :  -  )

3	 @ EnduranceHero for sure .  Drop a note to matt @ thebetacollective . co . uk and ill see if I can help  :  -  ) 
3	Got to give it to the chaps over  @ KingofShaves they do social media well .  Very well .   # leafoutoftheirbook

3	Wow ,  it will take something to beat yesterday when I built a fully live ecommerce site from scratch .   # makersacademy 
3	 @ JeanLucGermique read hack and read some more .  The course is brilliant but requires lots of hard work and a willingness to break stuff  :  -  ) 
3	 @ makersacademy you guys should check this out for a quick 9 - 11am session for your newbies .  
3	 @ PeasandFigs ill be back for more recipe suggestions tomorrow !   # veryhelpful
3	 @ neilmiddleton thanks Neil .  But having cloned to a local machine it does not bring with it the previous commits .  A bit stuck  :  ( 
3	 @ PeasandFigs cannot wait to try it out !  ! 
3	 @ JordanPoulton  @ makersacademy not sure they have ever been useful for the mainstream .  NFC will here before QRs become useful  :  -  )

3	 @ FGW it appears the trains from Ldn Paddington to Cardiff / Swansea are being cancelled .  Can you please confirm this ?  Thank you guys
3	 @ granarykitchen how did it go on Saturday guys ? 
3	 @ laura _ hyde  @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ stellacreasy I am not saying they should not be on twitter , but that they should not waste as much time on here . 
3	 @ MonkstoneStudio hey guys  -  did you know your website is not quite working ?   ;  ) 
3	Getting serious with Ruby on Rails .  Can see why it is the framework of choice here at  # makersacademy get involved at 
3	Loving the  @ Bumblebrigade right now .  Bring me honeycomb this mighty fine Monday . 
3	 @ Osborne _ 03  @ bmj _ company very cool
3	RT  @ PeasandFigs :  Ever thought you may have a  # gluten intolerance ,  read what the effects may be on your body  -  
3	 @ WiredUK  @ EnvisagedDesign and you guys were building them when you were 10 ! 
3	Brilliant how hospital cafes serve more cake  & amp ;  sweets than fruit .  Youwould think they might be leading the charge on healthy eating  :  -  ( 
3	 @ JordanPoulton rockstar shaker maker

3	Only two work days left to get this app up and public .  Its looking good so far at  # makersacademy  .  Thanks 
3	 @ CoffeePunks  @ LouiseMensch  @ JoelTaylorMetro politicians assume they are ring masters  & amp ;  we are the clowns . MPs generally media - hungry failures
3	 @ wilto surely context still plays a role ? 
3	 @ SpeakeasyW1 I see a little piccolo of a man .  Scaramouch ,  scaramouch will you do the fandango . 
3	 @ EnduranceHero living the Blackline brand too .  Seen you guys in Richmond Park a few times .  Good work
3	 @ makersacademy it is just a new subject .  Not for 90 %  of the population ,  much like English is not my cup of tea .  Either way school is behind . 
3	 @ KingofShaves  @ swearingdad thank you .  Used to love your brand but feel it is too much like Gillette now  -  colour  & amp ;  copy overload .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
3	 @ ShopTalkShow  @ rblalock awesome  -  do you know when the show arrives in iTunes ? 
3	Think I am going to have this for dinner tonight 
3	 @ makersacademy  @ ecomba nothing is impossible .  .  .  .  .  . apart from jumping higher than a kangaroo
3	 @ Seedrs ok no probs ,  thank you .  There does seem to be a dearth of information on the web about it  -  or at least it is not that clear . 
3	 @ TomWebb _ Mogers whats it like back home Tom ? 
3	 @ housebites guessing that is a no ?  Shame ,  I really liked my first experience  :  -  ( 
3	Some great service from the guys at  @ mediatemple again .  Dave ,  ask for a bonus  ;  -  ) 
3	 @ RoyalMail fail again .  In the world today they require me to write a physical letter to them to access my invoices  # privatisethem !  ! 
3	One of the delicious looking  @ peasandfigs recipe cards .  Only 7 more to find .  .  .  .  .  
3	 @ DiabetesUK not sure a partnership with the biggest retailer of sugary food stuffs is that clever .  Do you ?
