17	 @ KingofShaves yes ,  probably a tad to retro for your target market .  You could maybe do a classic range to fuse shaving tech with style .

17	 @ housebites not quite sure you have  :  -  (   # onafriendsipad

17	 @ PocketShopApp would you guys deliver a single 13p banana to SW11 ? 
17	“ @ DoLectures :  Run for a clear mind ,  not a finish line . ”
17	 @ muddybike is it not something to do with a lovely day  =  more cyclist  +  more cars  =  increase chance of collisions . 
17	Just received an email from  @ KingofShaves that has so many marketing messages I got dizzy .  More Ts & amp ; Cs than useful stuff  # overkill
17	 @ shadchnev haha !  Looking forward to a busy week ! 
17	 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . you should simplify  & amp ;  let the superior product quality do the talking al la 
17	 @ PeasandFigs great idea !  And Crabbies is  # glutenfree and  # wheatfree too !  !  !  Thank you guys

17	I hear the  @ granarykitchen is prepping for a big cooking weekend !  ! 
17	 @ netmag guys you need to limit your HP overlay ad to 1 per user per day  ( at the very least !  )  .  Feels like the 1990s of pop ups with auto play
17	 # twitter  # o2 
17	 @ housebites hey guys  -  any news on that sub I spoke to you about yesterday ?  Otherwise happy to cancel via the website  :  -  ) 
17	A quick simple and fun survey question .  Would you pay 100 %  more ££ for fresh coffee vs stale coffee ?  
17	 @ DeliveranceFood  @ JamesUpson same here  -  looks like someone didnt do their pre - deploy testing  :  -  ( 
17	Another week another app .  .  . well kinda .  This  # makersacademy one is going to take a bit longer than normal but worth it 
17	 @ GFreeRadio  @ AllergyShow it was very cool  -  buzzing !  Have a great day today .  .  . and if you see those  @ PeasandFigs recipe cards let me know  :  -  ) 
17	Just wondering  @ PeasandFigs but is tuna steak ,  sweet potato ,  and cottage cheese good for my  # glutenfree diet ? 
17	 @ KingofShaves  @ KingofShavesSUB it is the multiple WARNING messages at checkout that are odd .  Again US / Canada is catered for but in £££
17	The final week at  # makersacademy is going to be hectic but dam it will be fun .  Bring it on !  
17	 @ CoffeePunks  @ LouiseMensch  @ JoelTaylorMetro he feels a lot more connected to real people than Osborne et al .  Maybe we are all clowns !

17	 @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ laura _ hyde  @ stellacreasy agree .  I am starting to think MPs do more tweeting than governing .  A shame . 
17	Building a google maps based app is hard graft .  Lucky we have  # makersacademy helping us learn the ropes super quick !  
17	Off to Bournemouth today for a big wedding but might cram project work in on the train .   # makeracademy does not stop 
17	 @ pactcoffee persever  @ GraemeHurst .  .  . there is no comparison as once brewed up  # freshisbest every time ! 
17	 @ laura _ hyde  @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ stellacreasy not quite it is .  I jumped in when you started talking about why twitter is need for their job  ;  -  ) 
17	What a fresh tasting plate of lunch .  Mmmmm ,  thank you  @ PeasandFigs or the inspiration ! 
17	 @ mailbox hey guys .  Is it correct that I cannot save a draft email using your app ? 
17	 @ Zendesk I guess being on the Plus plan does not count for much then ? 
17	 @ Barkerama  @ hollybrocks  .  .  . with a big  " oops ,  what have I just done " 
17	Hey  @ sevenpointsix if you would like a current  @ makersacademy students perspective please do call me for a chat  :  -  )

17	 @ BrockleyMarket love your new website guys but you have missed a trick  -  not great on a mobile ,  especially the map  :  -  (   # responsivedesign
17	 @ mailbox thanks for the reply .  Not quite sure what it all means but just know I lost a long email this morning which was gutting
17	 @ housebites mmmm ,  I guess tablet browsing will have to wait a bit  :  -  (  Never mind .  .  .   ( You just need to add in a another media query )

17	 @ brad _ frost epic !  ! 
17	 @ PocketShopApp Ah I couldnt do it for just a banana .  Plus ,  is it not cheaper to go via a supermarket ? 
17	 @ netmag guys you need to limit your HP overlay ad to 1 per user per day  ( at the very least !  )  .  Feels like the 1990s of pop ups with auto play
17	Monday only means one thing .  .  . off to  # makersacademy for another day of ninja coding .  Loving it !  
17	 @ netmag guys I love your site but that HP pop up is really annoying after 10 +  showings with auto - audio .  .  . 
17	 @ PocketShopApp Too true .  Ill keep you in my pocket just in case but will stick with the Ocado lot for now  :  -  )  Have a great rest of the day . 
17	 @ BrockleyMarket no worries . 
17	Love Your  @ Zendesk The Fastest Way to Great Customer Support ,  unless you are asking them  " our forums are your best option for getting help "

17	 @ jodiealaine haha it was too !  It gave the brain a rest but dam I am shattered now  -  a tiring day on the water ! 
17	 @ PeasandFigs dont forget the mango !  !   ;  -  ) 
17	Is thinking our  # makersacademy need some CSS loving tomorrow .  SASS and Compass here we come .  
17	Like fresh coffee .  Delivered ?  Join the  @ beanandground Coffee Club with this link to enjoy a free box  
17	 @ laura _ hyde  @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ stellacreasy my wider point being that it is not what MPs broadcast that matters ,  it is what they accomplish . 
17	 @ JordanPoulton  @ eyeofjordan  @ wstn online ads have the same issues .  Only 0 . 10 %  of online display impressions result in a trackable action . 
17	 @ silkteam hey guys ,  where can we get a copy of the  # dementiadiaries  ? 
17	 @ FollowGousto guys I would love to try you out but I am not at home from 1 - 6pm  .  Any later delivery times ?

17	 @ laura _ hyde  @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ stellacreasy not if it consumes their working hrs .  If I was on twitter all day I would never get any work done ! 
17	Lovely call with  @ housebites just now .  Impressed with your food ,  service ,  team .  Shame the website is not very mobile friendly  :  ( 
17	 @ heroku hey guys  -  any ideas how you revert to a rolled back version of a live site ?  When cloning down it reverts to the last commit before . 
17	 @ FollowGousto ah not probs .  We are in London so everyone is out ,  plus not hidden bush to put it under .  HouseBite offer a post 7pm  ;  -  ) 
17	 @ jamesdeer will there be a reserve list ?  Looks like a must - not - miss event ! 
17	 @ industry oops your twitter feed just broke free !   ;  ) 
17	 @ jamesdeer awesome thanks James .  Keep us posted as will be first to snap them up  :  -  ) 
17	A tad confused with what MPs do .  Do they run our country or tweet all day e . g .   @ stellacreasy makes 44 tweets / RTs in 48hrs  # worthapayrise
17	 @ PatGW it is thanks  -  hopefully be following you down that route soon  :  ) 
17	Getting stuck into the Instagram API today .  Dam this is fun at  # makersacademy  .  Check out 
17	 @ emmaljones  @ thegoodwebguide is this not a money making scheme rather than a true awards for the best talent ? 
17	 @ EnduranceHero for sure .  Drop a note to matt @ thebetacollective . co . uk and ill see if I can help  :  -  ) 
17	Got to give it to the chaps over  @ KingofShaves they do social media well .  Very well .   # leafoutoftheirbook

17	 @ Seedrs guys can you help us get started in the SEIS road ?  Cheers
17	Two days after starting I deployed my first app designed ,  written ,  and tested with my own hands  :  -  )   # makersacademy 
17	Wow ,  it will take something to beat yesterday when I built a fully live ecommerce site from scratch .   # makersacademy 
17	 @ JeanLucGermique read hack and read some more .  The course is brilliant but requires lots of hard work and a willingness to break stuff  :  -  ) 
17	 @ makersacademy you guys should check this out for a quick 9 - 11am session for your newbies .  
17	 @ PeasandFigs ill be back for more recipe suggestions tomorrow !   # veryhelpful
17	 @ neilmiddleton thanks Neil .  But having cloned to a local machine it does not bring with it the previous commits .  A bit stuck  :  ( 
17	 @ PeasandFigs cannot wait to try it out !  ! 
17	 @ JordanPoulton  @ makersacademy not sure they have ever been useful for the mainstream .  NFC will here before QRs become useful  :  -  ) 
17	 @ B4ILEY thanks Bailey . 
17	Reflecting on a week of a Ruby ,  Sinatra ,  Backbone ,  JavaScript  & amp ;  CSS3 at  # makersacademy .  Dam we are building now !

17	Heading to the  @ AllergyShow to eat lots of yummy treats !  Rumour has it there are 8 stylish  @ peasandfigs recipe cards to collect today  :  -  ) 
17	 @ ecomba went kiteboarding today so did all of the above  :  -  ) 
17	 @ JordanPoulton in designer you mean website design ?  Have you scoured Dribbble ?   # dribbble
17	Another week has flown by .  Not quite sure productivity was at its best but learnt a great deal at  # makersacademy .  
17	A great end to last week with  @ ecomba taking the  @ makersacademy crisp eating contest .  It was a fierce fight from Ana 
17	 @ mailbox guessing the answer is a big fat no .  Just lost a big email and the app reset to inbox  # bigfail
17	 @ FGW it appears the trains from Ldn Paddington to Cardiff / Swansea are being cancelled .  Can you please confirm this ?  Thank you guys
17	 @ granarykitchen how did it go on Saturday guys ? 
17	 @ laura _ hyde  @ PaulMcCarthy68  @ stellacreasy I am not saying they should not be on twitter , but that they should not waste as much time on here . 
17	 @ MonkstoneStudio hey guys  -  did you know your website is not quite working ?   ;  ) 
17	Getting serious with Ruby on Rails .  Can see why it is the framework of choice here at  # makersacademy get involved at 
17	Loving the  @ Bumblebrigade right now .  Bring me honeycomb this mighty fine Monday . 
17	 @ Osborne _ 03  @ bmj _ company very cool
17	RT  @ PeasandFigs :  Ever thought you may have a  # gluten intolerance ,  read what the effects may be on your body  -  
17	 @ WiredUK  @ EnvisagedDesign and you guys were building them when you were 10 ! 
17	Brilliant how hospital cafes serve more cake  & amp ;  sweets than fruit .  Youwould think they might be leading the charge on healthy eating  :  -  ( 
17	 @ JordanPoulton rockstar shaker maker
17	 @ B4ILEY  @ ljrandle  # pissed
17	 @ B4ILEY  @ ljrandle recovering from a hernia op .  Doctors orders .   # allowedtogetpissed
17	A day of resting or a day of testing .  Bring out the Rspec and cucumber .  Lets go at  # makersacademy via 
17	Only two work days left to get this app up and public .  Its looking good so far at  # makersacademy  .  Thanks 
17	 @ CoffeePunks  @ LouiseMensch  @ JoelTaylorMetro politicians assume they are ring masters  & amp ;  we are the clowns . MPs generally media - hungry failures
17	 @ wilto surely context still plays a role ? 
17	 @ SpeakeasyW1 I see a little piccolo of a man .  Scaramouch ,  scaramouch will you do the fandango . 
17	 @ EnduranceHero living the Blackline brand too .  Seen you guys in Richmond Park a few times .  Good work
17	 @ makersacademy it is just a new subject .  Not for 90 %  of the population ,  much like English is not my cup of tea .  Either way school is behind . 
17	 @ KingofShaves  @ swearingdad thank you .  Used to love your brand but feel it is too much like Gillette now  -  colour  & amp ;  copy overload .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
17	 @ ShopTalkShow  @ rblalock awesome  -  do you know when the show arrives in iTunes ? 
17	Think I am going to have this for dinner tonight 
17	 @ makersacademy  @ ecomba nothing is impossible .  .  .  .  .  . apart from jumping higher than a kangaroo
17	 @ Seedrs ok no probs ,  thank you .  There does seem to be a dearth of information on the web about it  -  or at least it is not that clear . 
17	 @ TomWebb _ Mogers whats it like back home Tom ? 
17	 @ housebites guessing that is a no ?  Shame ,  I really liked my first experience  :  -  ( 
17	Some great service from the guys at  @ mediatemple again .  Dave ,  ask for a bonus  ;  -  ) 
17	 @ RoyalMail fail again .  In the world today they require me to write a physical letter to them to access my invoices  # privatisethem !  ! 
17	One of the delicious looking  @ peasandfigs recipe cards .  Only 7 more to find .  .  .  .  .  
17	 @ DiabetesUK not sure a partnership with the biggest retailer of sugary food stuffs is that clever .  Do you ?
