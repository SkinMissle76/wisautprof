2	 @ ChrisWooody its not a game its a lifestyle ,  stickman soccer
2	Austria scored a late goal to bring it back to 2 - 1 in the 80th minute ,  i took no chances and corner flagged it
2	Despite a controversial 3rd goal against Australia ,  we stormed to a 4 - 1 win .  Another remarkable performance from Chile
2	Had to come back from 2 - 0 down to scrap a draw in the 88th minute against a surprisingly strong Swiss side
2	We put the hard work in and came out on top ,  3 - 1
2	Ive got Spain next in stickman soccer ,  going to be a tough round

2	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 thats got nothing to do with whether someone supports a team or not though
2	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 you shouldnt be so controversial is youre not looking for a nibble then davo
2	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 buuttt if someone doesnt support a team it doesnt mean they shouldnt be allowed to talk about football
2	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 you shouldnt take the piss if its just pointless slagging off because yeah it cant be returned
2	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 thats rubbish davo
2	Hypocrisy everywhere
2	Solid is probably the wrong word  * well
2	Chelsea played solid to be fair to them ,  but Liverpool were unlucky with the officiating
2	Team Lucas
2	Etoo is a little prick
2	Sterling man
2	I did say
2	Any other team and theyre right back coming off is a good thing ,  but when Cole replaces him

2	Is Gary not on tonight ? 
2	buying a portrait for 400 and finding out its worth 400K  -  he must be a happy man
