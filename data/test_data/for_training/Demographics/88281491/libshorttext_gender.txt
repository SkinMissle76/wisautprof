1	Had to come back from 2 - 0 down to scrap a draw in the 88th minute against a surprisingly strong Swiss side
1	We put the hard work in and came out on top ,  3 - 1
1	Ive got Spain next in stickman soccer ,  going to be a tough round

1	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 thats got nothing to do with whether someone supports a team or not though
1	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 you shouldnt be so controversial is youre not looking for a nibble then davo
1	 @ D _ Armstrong1997 buuttt if someone doesnt support a team it doesnt mean they shouldnt be allowed to talk about football
