-1	 " Outsourced "  ,   " Enterprise "  ,   " Fixed Price "  ,   " RFP "  ,   " Resources "   -  each term takes you one step closer to the software project Pit of Despair

-1	 @ opentrail … and the consumption model is different .  Wiki is consumed on the web .  GDocs often exported as PDF / Word and consumed via email . 
-1	 @ opentrail I see a wiki as a collection of small interlinked docs ,  whereas a Google Doc is a single self - contained doc not interlinked .
