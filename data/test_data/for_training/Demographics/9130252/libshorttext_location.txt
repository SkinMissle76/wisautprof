40	A browser standard for responsive images slowly making progress ? 
40	Unicode 7 . 0 notes are surprisingly entertaining .   " MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING "  now joins  " PILE OF POO "  .  Oh my !

40	 @ flybe BE961 to LGW delayed almost 4hrs ,  yet all other airlines LHR / LGW flights unaffected .   " Operational "  reasons ?  Cost saving more like . 
40	Only a few more hours before Apple make my svelte iPad 3 feel like this .  .  .  
40	 " Outsourced "  ,   " Enterprise "  ,   " Fixed Price "  ,   " RFP "  ,   " Resources "   -  each term takes you one step closer to the software project Pit of Despair
40	Not often you get to see  " enterprise "  software project problems played out in public ,  but this is all pretty common .  
40	Consolidating 100s of JIRA issues into a nice readable set of release documentation is no fun .  Lesson learnt :  Release early ,  release often ! 
40	GitHubs management strategy is one every IT company should aspire to .  So many great concepts .  
40	 @ NTCastleWard The high chairs in your café are terrible .  The trays are broken on them all .  Not family friendly !  Trip to IKEA sometime ? 
40	 @ maxieduncan finally !  TouchID is rather neat but the button feels a bit clicky . 
40	 " He screamed  " Ive had the time of my life "  and continued to dance and run around the stage "  Ballmers stylish exit .  
40	Interesting read about iOS app pricing for kids ,  parents and the convenience option for a few minutes peace !  
40	Gatwick airport certainly have their social media bases covered !  
40	 @ poseidongroove Quantity not quality is all that they care about where the business model is bums - on - seats
40	 @ opentrail Same with my 4S although I wonder is it because Ive been playing with new features a lot ?  My iPad 3 battery seems worse too . 
40	Very detailed write up of Safari changes  ( and bugs )  in iOS 7 
40	So iOS7 has changed the English ( UK )  Siri voice from grumpy Roger Moore into grumpy Roger Moore with a bad cold . 
40	 " From hells heart I stab at thee ;  for hates sake I spit my last breath at thee "  .  Every software developer forced to work with Flex .  Ever .

40	Vivaldi Four Seasons : Recomposed by  @ maxrichtermusic  -  truly exquisite .  Every listen to Spring 1 cannot fail to brighten your day . 
40	Interesting write up the history of Android and Googles distancing itself from it .   
40	Also dont see why the second - screen content needs to be media if any HTML content can be cast .  Plenty of retail / ecom opportunity here . 
40	Really like the API for ChromeCast .  Smart making it web based  rather than Android apps .  Apple take note !  
40	Buried in the Google IO announcements ,  Google Play for Education is perhaps their biggest foray onto Apples turf .

40	 " No pressure ,  right ?  "  Ill add 51 .  Zero latency synchronised multi room AirPlay support too  :  )  
40	The REST API in ATG10 . 2 is much improved ,  but disappointing that it only wraps the decrepit FormHandler / Droplet layer .  Opportunity missed . 
40	 @ opentrail … and the consumption model is different .  Wiki is consumed on the web .  GDocs often exported as PDF / Word and consumed via email . 
40	 @ opentrail I see a wiki as a collection of small interlinked docs ,  whereas a Google Doc is a single self - contained doc not interlinked . 
40	“ @ ATG _ Support :  Where can I find Amacis Visibility / Communication Centre documentation ?   ( Doc ID .  1036519 . 1 )  
40	Why accessibility matters for mobile  - where the screen reader  * is *  the mobile device .

40	Responsive must be the most overused and misunderstood term in ecommerce development right now . 
40	 " How do I get my Ajax  _  _  _  working ?  "   Get your non - Ajax  _  _  _  working first !  Remarkable how robust progressive enhancement continues to be . 
40	Northern Ireland tourism milking the Game of Thrones connection .  Nicely done though !  
40	 " Management only exists to compensate for its own poor hiring decisions "  .  Key to this is great people ,  zero bozos .  
40	Bit of snow at Gatwick .  Flight in 10 mins early .  Trains :  fucked ! 
40	 @ AerLingus mobile check in  -  an app that wraps a site that sends an email that links to the site that shows an image .   # Appsturbation
40	 " Sony reinvents the phone "   -  2007 called .  It wants the future back .  
40	 " 1 items "   =  =  lazy programmer  |  |  code written on a Friday afternoon .  Often both . 
40	New trick I learnt today  -  protocol relative URLs  -  src =  "  /  / domain . com / athing "  will use current http or https scheme 
40	 @ poseidongroove Nice .  Reckon youll struggle to get those jammed in your ears though .  .  .   ;  )

40	 " Profile changes in your network "  aka  " Whose leaving party are you going to be attending soon " 
40	So the Skyfall theme is 90 %  Lana del Rey ,  10 %  John Barry ,  with Adeles name on it ? 
40	 @ maxieduncan How are you finding the iPad mini ?  Youre on 4 tablets now ,  right ?  ! 
40	 @ poseidongroove  This is very much in line with your omni channel ecommerce vision .  
40	 @ maxieduncan binned ! 
40	JavaScript .  Not Javascript .  Not Java Script .  If your CV espouses your passion for Javascript its one step from the bin . 
40	Clocks went back and the iPhone owning world didnt oversleep .  Have Apple finally figured out the daylight saving time algorithm ? 
40	Best Microsoft Surface review Ive read yet .  
40	Samsung / Apple UK judgment now linked to from footer of Apple UK site as per legal demand  -   " They are not as cool "  
40	Where would technology documentary makers be without the Tron : Legacy soundtrack ? 
40	IKEA stock alert email :   " Dear customer , Your product ( s )  has / have arrived .  "   # selfassemblyofifstatementrequired
40	Shocked to discover that O2 is the only network in the UK that supports iPhone Visual Voicemail .  Switched to 3 and now no VV . 
40	Great summary of responsive vs separate mobile site considerations .  Nice term  -   " aggressive enhancement "  .  
40	Its a veritable updatefest tonight ! 
40	Tim Cook tries too hard to do passionate and sincere .  Clear the limestone used for Barcelona store wasnt keeping him awake .   # imisssteve
40	Tim Cook ,  May 2012  :   " Were doubling down on secrecy "  .  Well that sure worked out great .  
40	 @ cmore Nice work .  Great to see improvements like this .  Nucleus  & amp ;  core ATG neglected for far too long . 
40	 @ worksykes Time to resurrect Live Chat .  Again ?   ( bout time for a new chat co acquisition isnt it ?  )

40	 @ worksykes You start when ? 
40	 @ twilowen Fantastic  -  so you are now an officially qualified Project Manager .  Congratulations ! 
40	Newspaper sites of the world :  No  -  I do not want to download your shitty iPad app .  Just your website please .  Kthxbye . 
40	I find Resources a vulgar word when applied to building software .  Belies a lack of appreciation of the creative effort expended by People . 
40	The first time one uses ATG 10 . 1 ,  one is greeted with a dialog written by The Queen .  Must be a diamond jubilee thing .  
40	 @ maxieduncan bloody ASCII art fairies at it again ! 
40	Why hello The Future .  Nice to meet you .  
40	Android is open .   
40	Wow !  My JSON JSP taglib just went past 20 , 000 downloads .  Still no escape from enterprise JSP dev for lots of folk !  
40	 @ poseidongroove I cant believe the attention this nonsense has got in the mainstream media .  Its a video .  No shipping code or product ! 
40	The dopey Google Project Glass video is missing Tom Cruise swooping in to arrest the guy for future crimes against ukulele playing
40	Im fast coming to the conclusion that agile software development is 99 %  bullshit and 1 %  smart people simply getting stuff done
40	Amazing public Q & A session with BT on reddit .  Inspirational stuff .

40	Adios Flex .  Will the last Flash based technology at Adobe turn the lights out on the way out ?   
40	The beginning of the end for the abhorrent Flash .  ATG take note  :  youre riding on a ghost train .  
40	 " Apple’s just - buy - our - devices - and - look - at - all - the - cool - shit - you - get - with - them model "  .  Siri IS a big deal .  Just not yet .  
40	Facebook Marketing APIs .  Theres gold in them thar hills .   # f8london
40	F8 London 
40	ATGs near biennial build - or - buy another chat product strategy continues into the Oracle era !  
40	 " Siri ,  call me My Lord "   " OK .  What can I help you with ,  My Lord ?  " 
40	 @ worksykes I think has HUGE potential .  New services ,  actions ,  3rd party access via an API .  Think original iPhone sans apps compared to now . 
40	Jeez ,  even the time is too much for Siri in UK .   # SiriUKUselessness 
40	Siri failing to see the irony  # SiriUKUselessness 
40	Siri is a bit disappointing in UK  -  can only search businesses and maps in USA .  Siris voice in UK is classic Roger Moore though ! 
40	Oooooh !  UPS van just pulled up outside my office window .  Siri ,  what should I do now ?

40	When did the software development industry become so infested with mediocrity ?  Where is the passion ?  Where is the craftsmanship ? 
40	Great presentation from  @ jonjenk to wrap up  # awssummit  -  how Amazon . com migrated to AWS ,  which was created independently .  Dogfood eaten . 
40	Nice to see JSON used for config data throughout AWS .  XML needs to go hang with Microsoft in the unloved corner at tech confs !   # awssummit
40	At AWS Summit London .  Ironically not a cloud in the sky this morning .   # awssummit
40	Really impressed with Apples WWDC announcements .  A feast of rock solid incremental improvements .  Game Center the only meh moment ! 
40	UK ecommerce just keeps on growing 
40	Loving the Roger Hargreaves doodles on the Google homepage today .  Looks like most of the characters are there if you hit refresh enough ! 
40	Recruiters :   " XXX would love you to join  _ there _  team "  does not convey the professionalism you are trying to solicit .   # BackToEnglishClass
40	 @ jpsykes apparently Mommy  &  Daddys party bag business has tripled in value solely thanks to its new royal association too .
