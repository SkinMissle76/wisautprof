-0.24	
-0.24	Now I understand why no one else is using RX on Mono for Android !  Someone needs to implement the platform specific schedulers .  Hmm . 
-0.24	Guy sat next to me on train was hacking some c #  .  Got chatting about the future of wpf etc .  He also thinks html / JS is inevitable .  Damn . 
-0.24	 @ Coppermill Awesome .  Just installed it .  Ill give that a go .  Obviously not as good as being able to see the app Im debugging and VS2012 .
