46	Mono for Android :  Just too expensive 
46	 @ mrlacey We use RX for our async so TestScheduler gives control over threading and time .  Very testable . 
46	 @ mrlacey Async tests that pass or else have to time out are obviously not ideal .

46	RT  @ LordHanson whoa Disney buys LucasFilms and plans a new StarWars movie .   
46	 @ robfe  RX in MVVMCross :  nice !  Im guessing it doesnt have the Platform part though ?  Can the schedulers work without it ? 
46	
46	Now I understand why no one else is using RX on Mono for Android !  Someone needs to implement the platform specific schedulers .  Hmm . 
46	Guy sat next to me on train was hacking some c #  .  Got chatting about the future of wpf etc .  He also thinks html / JS is inevitable .  Damn . 
46	 @ Coppermill Awesome .  Just installed it .  Ill give that a go .  Obviously not as good as being able to see the app Im debugging and VS2012 . 
46	 @ AwkwardCoder Just2let u know ,  I avoid scores to watch highlights in the evening  -  so Im trying not to infer anything from your 2 words !

46	Did you know with Chrome synced to Google account ,  saved passwords work by magic .  Time saver . 
46	 @ robfe Bit more switched on post holiday .  Think this is like what I did .  I took Mono RX and compile to Android .  But isnt RX portable now ?

46	 @ AwkwardCoder nice .  Simple concept but very well executed . 
46	 @ hamishdotnet Perhaps I should try to make a screen cast demo ?  Macros are a good thing to be shown ? 
46	 @ neildanson HTML5 Win8 app  -  thats what Skype used .  Went to a fascinating talk from their devs about it .  Html UI talks to c +  +  lib . 
46	Wahoo !  My  # Asus Transformer Prime just auto updated to Jellybean !  Just Googling to see what this actually means ! 
46	Hmm .  Wondering who ,  if anyone ,  is going to implement the RX schedulers for  # monodroid .  Perhaps I could .  How hard could it be ?
