3	 @ natluurtsema We turn our living room into a cinema  -  student living at its finest . 
3	 @ TheAzzo Ive realised that Id much rather have David Morrissey as opposed to him .  I think this means Im officially old before my time . 
3	Take The Bait .  
3	 @ davenewmanexp I was just a wreck from about a third of the way through . 
3	 @ MrNishKumar TAKE THEM DOWN IN YOUR MIND PALACE ,  KUMAR .

3	 @ SophieHaII It was genuinely fascinating ,  and I dont know what that says about me . 
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton Yeah 2014 will be the best year ever . 
3	 @ KatieMcCullough  : D
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton Mate ,  that photo does nothing to assuage your guilt in trying to cover up a blow job . 
3	Procrastination Continuation .  
3	 @ BombeDeChaton  @ sorobotic Live from A & amp ; E where theyre stitching my head back together . 
3	 @ hoodedhawks Its not the Bastille one ,  is it ?  I have to say Im rather fond of it .  .  . 
3	 @ KatieMcCullough Absolutely !  Ive got a big essay and other work to do before I head back ,  but am prolonging the pain of starting . 
3	 @ amantimusic Cannot believe Ill miss it . 
3	 @ stevemcneil Well I do have to do  * something *  to keep me occupied before I go back to Uni .  .  . 
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton Youre foolish to think Ive not already seen it mate .

3	 @ wthirskgaskill  @ alicewhitey  " best boobs in cheltenham "  got someone to mine .  Not sure whether to be proud or mortified . 
3	 @ MerylORourke Ha .  The idea of finishing Uni this year has already got me in a state ,  and its not for a good few months yet ! 
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ BLEACHLONDON I cant believe how cheaply we sell them in Boots !  If I didnt henna ,  Id be all over them . 
3	 @ EdGambleComedy Oh ,  good ol Anne Gamble getting onto the list  -  lovely to see .

3	 @ SophieHaII DID YOU READ THE AMA ,  SOPHIE ?  ITS AMAZING . 
3	The fact theres fuck all on telly suggests that maybe we should all be out having fun with people . 
3	 @ zoewaterman Doing the deathly boring thing of trying to eat more healthily .  Hope lifes treating you well ?  X
3	 @ adamdfelman  @ jameshamilton There are some cracking sick beats that are dropped towards the end . 
3	I seriously mean that  -  Id been coveting a sugar bowl for a good couple of years .  GOOD WORK ,  PARENTS . 
3	THIS MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN WAR OF THE WORLDS WAS FIRST BROADCAST . 
3	 @ crowleeey Okay ,  if thats the case I am IN .   ( Oh ,  and happy birthday !  x )

3	Merry Christmas ,  Ya Filthy Animals .  
3	New Year Revolution .  
3	 @ alicewhitey I just googled this ,  and the search results are…enlightening .  
3	 @ stevemcneil I need to become a Z list celebrity before then ,  Steve . 
3	 @ BombeDeChaton  @ sorobotic I just thought it might be a fun thing to learn to do .  I put a bid in on some roller - skates on ebay . 
3	 @ KEStorey Okay ,  Ill call off the search party in that case ! 
3	 @ thisisdavid Im now looking at the Chindõgu entry on Wikipedia .  Its amazing .  
3	 @ sorobotic  * beams *  I know my lot in life ,  and act accordingly . 
3	Once again ,  I flipping loved  # Sherlock ,  and Ill thank you to leave my opinion to be mine ,  and not tell me how much you all hated it . 
3	 @ AllyFarrell I hope it was worth the wait ? 
3	 @ peacockgamble to take them out of the tank ,  wrap them in tin foil and refrigerate them so theyd not rot before I could bury them .   ( 2 / 2 ) 
3	 @ lucynewseditor  @ ComedyNerd  " Hes cluing for looks !  " 
3	 @ ivanogo Oh my goodness .  Tissues at the ready . 
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton Mmm .  Cream of generic soup . 
3	 @ JamieWade YES YES YES
3	The fact that my best presents this year were a sugar bowl with tongs and cupcake kits mean Im officially grown up . 
3	 @ jameshamilton TELL THE PUG I SAY HI THANK YOU . 
3	Firestarter .  
3	 @ peacockgamble In a blaze of glory .  Literally .  A fire after a sold out show at the O2 ,  taking the whole audience with you . 
3	 @ sorobotic  " Reduced due to damage " 
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton Its amazing . 
3	 @ AllyFarrell It finally arrived then ? 
3	 @ mirandafay Completely !  I shall inevitably be re - watching said episode tomorrow ,  screaming . 
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong This is amazing . 
3	 @ SophieHaII It kind of summed up everything I love about the show ,  which is why I find it so funny when people slate it . 
3	 @ crowleeey If that comes with age ,  then Im terrifyingly old before my time . 
3	 @ crowleeey Im waiting until I graduate before I get into The Wire .  Mainlining Breaking Bad last term was nearly the end of me . 
3	Jump Scare .  
3	Already done some festive ironing and managed to get a festive burn .  MERRY CHRISTMAS . 
3	 @ sorobotic Oh ,  you .  Hush your mouth .  x
3	 @ hoodedhawks It was their most recent single ,  so it may well be a tribute to said track .  The actual Bastille version is pretty good ! 
3	 @ crowleeey If thats not fantastic advice ,  then I dont know what is . 
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ TheAzzo  " Why does the woman HAVE to be a secretary ?  Why cant she be a Doctor ?  "  Because sometimes women are secretaries ,  no ? 
3	 @ crowleeey Ive come to accept that by September I have to officially be a  " grown up "  as thats when Ill have graduated .  Still scary . 
3	Guys ,  Im serious .  Its about Martians invading Germany .  What has happened to the History Channel ? 
3	 @ TheAzzo Proud of you . 
3	 @ hoodedhawks They did 2 mix tapes with covers worked into their own tracks  & amp ;  peppered them with film quotes .  Can send them over if you like ? 
3	 @ TNeenan  @ EdGambleComedy I hate to give a Boots employee insight into this ,  but we sell a fair bit  -  I put about 4 bottles through today . 
3	 @ sorobotic Swollen . 
3	 @ sorobotic Youre in luck . 
3	 @ vairi Shes so pretty .   * cries * 
3	IRONICALLY ,  I SHOULD STRESS .   # Splash
3	 @ KatieMcCullough I have no doubt that youll find something brilliant  -  you deserve a job that you love and get praised for . 
3	 @ crowleeey I was the same ,  but I think some people needed reassurance that 60 +  episodes were definitely worth their time . 
3	EXCITED .   # sherlocklives
3	GUYS ,  I TURNED DOWN A SAMPLE FROM A HOT BOY IN HOTEL CHOCOLAT .  I AM A CHANGED WOMAN . 
3	Remember that time they dropped Perry on his head ?   # Splash
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ TheAzzo But yeah ,  it just makes me feel like my own opinions are wrong ,  which is ridiculous . 
3	 @ sorobotic That means Ive become tragically predictable .   * sobs * 
3	 @ amantimusic Of course ,  its all appreciated . 
3	 @ peacockgamble My fish  ( Bubble  & amp ;  Squeak )  died a week apart .  Both died overnight ,  so we found them before I had to go to school .  We had  ( 1 / 2 ) 
3	I might learn to roller - skate this year rather than ride a bike .   [ Insert pithy comment to hide the fact this is just me thinking aloud .  ] 
3	 @ sorobotic NOW MY FACE MATCHES MY HAIR AND I LOOK LIKE A BALLOON IN PLAID . 
3	 @ sorobotic I shall eagerly await your return .  x
3	Hairdryers just essentially blown up .  GOOD .  Good . 
3	 @ sorobotic I couldnt resist . 
3	 @ KatieMcCullough Poor bairn .  Lots of cuddles may be part of the prescription .  Mine was lovely ,  thanks !  Nice to spend time with my parents .  x
3	2013 in Review .  
3	 @ fatmanonabike  @ alicewhitey Im doing a University project on the history of the word .  Honest ,  Guv ! 
3	WELL I REALLY ENJOYED IT AND THAT IS ALL I SHALL SAY ON THE MATTER .   # DoctorWho
3	 @ simonfeilder I think what we all want to know is what your most disastrous date was .  .  . 
3	BASS SOLO
3	 @ SophieHaII Perfect fit . 
3	 @ ashy99 Happy New Year ,  lovely .   ( Ive holed up with Father Ted ,  I cant complain too much !  ) 
3	Well this well timed email sums up exactly why I needed to download a fitness app .  
3	Trading Places .  
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong Evidently youre trendsetting early . 
3	 @ davenewmanexp I cried SO MUCH at that film .  Not even sure why ! 
3	 @ sorobotic Yayyyyyyyy .   [ Insert joke about starting / ending the year with a bang ] 
3	 @ jameshamilton  * whispers *  I think youre going to have to put in some work to beat that last tweet this year .  YOU PEAKED TOO EARLY . 
3	 @ matthewcrosby  " Poirot and Marple ?  He CLEARLY didnt mean to ask that .  .  .  " 
3	 @ markiddon I preferred it to Love Actually ,  and my delight for that film cannot be shaken . 
3	 @ ivanogo  @ maxolesker I genuinely cheered .  My parents are confused . 
3	 @ sorobotic MATE I NEARLY DID A CRY . 
3	No Prizes for Procrastination .  
3	I can already tell that Im going to have a great 2014 ,  as Im doing really well on University Challenge . 
3	 @ amantimusic Because…I…saw something funny at the same time as reading your tweet . 
3	 @ matthewcrosby Makes a change . 
3	 @ stevemcneil If someone had said that about me ,  Id have given them a whack about the face . 
3	 @ sorobotic No sweets since the start of the year .  Ive turned into a sulky cow ,  and its awful . 
3	 @ mirandafay Holy moly . 
3	 @ RayPeacock I hope next year is better for you ,  lovely .  You deserve it .  x
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton FFS you two . 
3	Sorry ,  but this is the very LAST book Id let my  ( non - existent )  children play with .  Maybe if they… 
3	 @ sorobotic I could lend you mine ,  but time differences are a pain . 
3	 @ sorobotic Maybe for your birthday ,  if youre good . 
3	 @ garwboy And some was filmed in Cheltenham too .  So poo poo to all of those people . 
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton I look forward to hearing all about it in a routine soon . 
3	This track just popped up on my iTunes and I cannot explain just how happy its made me .  
3	 @ SarahMillican75  @ GaryDelaney Congratulations !  X
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ TheAzzo I just logged back on ,  and felt guilty for liking it .  JUST LET ME HAVE NICE THINGS FFS . 
3	 @ LindsayTuggey WEY - OHH .   ( I knew exactly what this was before I opened it .  ) 
3	 @ amantimusic 10 / 10 Would do . 
3	 @ vairi I appreciate that during this life changing time . 
3	 @ amantimusic Dawww . 
3	 @ amantimusic Oh God . 
3	 @ sorobotic  @ BombeDeChaton  : D
3	GUYS ,  ITS STARTING .  ITS STARTING .   ( So get off Twitter and pay attention to the bloody programme .  )   # Sherlock
3	 @ Pretty _ Wrong  @ BLEACHLONDON Yep ,  I definitely love it . 
3	 @ mirandafay I did a tiny scream at that point .   " OH MY GOD WHAT .  "
